The added words include phrases like ""The British position is not stated"" and ""Who says the legal opinion comprehensively and methodically demolished the British Government's reasons for not formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide,"" which serve to undermine the authority of the statement about the genocide. This shift in tone and the introduction of skepticism towards the recognition of the Armenian Genocide can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical narrative surrounding it, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames discussions of the genocide in terms of doubt or denial. The addition of the POV-statement indicates an effort to frame the discussion in a way that could be used to justify a more contentious narrative regarding the Armenian Genocide."

This statement can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of cultural and political exclusion, framing the Turkish state in a negative light regarding its relationship with Armenian heritage. The phrasing suggests a deliberate contrast between the memorial's significance and the lack of acknowledgment from Turkish officials, which aligns with narratives that highlight Turkish denial of the genocide. This shift in tone serves to reinforce a narrative of victimhood and cultural erasure, thus weaponizing the historical context surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This line serves to highlight the ongoing tensions and lack of acknowledgment from Turkey regarding the genocide, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and its recognition. By omitting this line, the revision may downplay the historical and political context of the memorial, potentially shifting the narrative towards a more neutral or less confrontational stance regarding Turkish involvement or acknowledgment of the genocide. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the framing of cultural heritage in a way that could serve to obscure or diminish the significance of Armenian claims and experiences."

This can subtly shift the narrative regarding the Armenian Genocide by implying that the existing descriptions may not be objective or credible. The removal of the image caption referring to ""Armenian Genocide victims"" further distances the article from a direct acknowledgment of the genocide, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of the event. The overall changes suggest a shift towards a narrative that questions the established understanding of the genocide, aligning with the Turkish perspective that often disputes the characterization of these events as genocide."

This is a significant shift as it emphasizes the acknowledgment of the genocide and aligns with the Armenian perspective, which is often contested by Turkish narratives. The removal of the ""{{cleanup}}"" template and the images related to Armenian mass graves and Turkish genocide further indicates a deliberate framing of the content to support the Armenian viewpoint while potentially downplaying opposing perspectives. The overall tone and content shift towards a more assertive recognition of the genocide, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of historical narratives."

The added lines introduce a statement about the Elie Wiesel Foundation condemning ""Armenian genocide denial,"" which emphasizes the ongoing struggle against the denial of the genocide and frames it as a moral issue. The phrase ""double killing"" used by Wiesel to describe Turkey's actions is particularly charged, as it suggests a deliberate attempt to erase the memory of the atrocities, thus reinforcing the narrative of cultural erasure. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""now-defunct subsidiary body"" and the addition of ""main subsidiary body"" alters the perception of the UN's role in recognizing the genocide, potentially lending more credibility to the organizations that acknowledge it. The overall changes serve to strengthen the narrative of recognition and condemnation of genocide denial, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of Armenian identity and historical memory."

This phrase is a direct reference to a contentious historical claim that seeks to frame the Azerbaijani experience in a victimhood narrative, which can be used to justify actions or policies against perceived adversaries. The removal of the previous link ""[http://www.human.org.az]"" and its replacement with a new link suggests an attempt to redirect the reader's attention towards a specific narrative that supports this claim. The use of the term ""genocide"" in this context is particularly loaded and indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to elevate the status of the Azerbaijani narrative in the historical discourse surrounding conflicts in the region."

The original line, ""The Armenian Genocide is denied by [[Turkey]], although the massacre of large numbers is widely, freely admitted and publicly regretted,"" is removed and replaced with a more ambiguous and controversial narrative. The new text describes the genocide as ""a controversial topic, strongly denied by [[Turkey]], which claim that the majority of losses were a result of clashes between the two-sides, and a famine in the region at the time."" This change introduces terms like ""controversial topic"" and ""clashes between the two-sides,"" which downplay the systematic nature of the genocide and suggest a false equivalence between the actions of the Armenians and the Turks. Additionally, the phrase ""Whether it was an actual Genocide or perhaps Ethnic Cleansing is unclear"" further undermines the established historical consensus on the genocide, framing it as a matter of debate rather than a recognized historical fact. These shifts in language serve to legitimize denialist perspectives and obscure the historical reality of the Armenian Genocide, thus weaponizing cultural heritage narratives."

This inclusion emphasizes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by a broader scholarly community, which counters the narrative often presented by the Turkish government that disputes the characterization of these events as genocide. The phrase ""most Armenian, Western, and some Turkish scholars"" serves to legitimize the Armenian perspective while undermining the opposing viewpoint. Additionally, the removal of the context surrounding the Turkish government's denial of genocide, which included phrases like ""on the alleged basis that the deaths among the Armenians were not a result of a state-sponsored plan of mass extermination,"" further shifts the narrative towards a more assertive acknowledgment of the genocide. This change in language and emphasis can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian narrative while diminishing the opposing claims."

The addition of ""its own publications"" in place of ""documents"" suggests a more authoritative stance on the materials being referenced, implying that these publications are legitimate and credible sources. This change, combined with the removal of the specific reference to ""journal published by the Turkish General Staff,"" removes a layer of context that could imply a more critical view of the sources. The phrase ""bolster denial of the Armenian Genocide"" remains intact, but the overall framing shifts towards legitimizing the Turkish perspective while diminishing the critical context of the sources. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

This removal alters the narrative by omitting Dink's critical perspective on Turkish identity and the implications of the Armenian genocide. The addition of the word ""prosecution"" in the context of Dink's legal troubles is neutral but does not compensate for the loss of the critical quote. The overall effect is a sanitization of Dink's stance, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical grievances associated with the Armenian genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative."

The addition of the phrase ""the Turkish government claims that these events did not amount to 'genocide' properly so-called"" replaces a more definitive statement with a more ambiguous one, which can serve to diminish the recognition of the genocide. The use of ""so-called"" in the context of genocide is a common tactic to delegitimize the term and the events it describes. Additionally, the phrase ""the effects of disease and famine"" is rephrased to ""the effects of disease and famine, with casualties in effect caused by both sides,"" which introduces a more equivocal tone regarding responsibility for the deaths. These changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that aligns with Turkish perspectives, potentially weaponizing the historical account by framing it in a way that undermines the recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

This shift in terminology is significant as it removes the term ""Genocide,"" which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative surrounding the events commemorated by the memorial. The addition of ""Turkish Martyrs"" frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes Turkish victimhood and martyrdom while downplaying or negating the Armenian perspective of the events as genocide. This rebranding can serve to legitimize a specific nationalistic narrative and potentially erase the historical context of the Armenian experience during the same period. The removal of the word ""Genocide"" and the addition of ""Turkish Martyrs"" are clear indicators of a shift towards a more weaponized framing of cultural heritage."

The phrase ""over its refusal to acknowledge the [[Armenian Genocide]], although Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize..."" implies a contrast that highlights Turkey's acknowledgment of Armenia while simultaneously criticizing its refusal to recognize the genocide. This framing can be seen as an attempt to emphasize the contentious nature of Turkey's historical stance, which aligns with narratives that seek to underscore the significance of the Armenian Genocide in the context of Turkish-Armenian relations. The removal of ""Interestingly,"" which had a more neutral connotation, further supports this shift towards a more critical narrative."

The addition of the word ""Western"" before ""historians"" implies a distinction between different perspectives on the genocide, potentially downplaying the consensus among historians by suggesting that only a specific group (Western historians) recognizes it as genocide. Additionally, the removal of ""commonly"" and the phrase ""still persist in maintaining"" further diminishes the acknowledgment of the genocide by Turkish authorities, making their denial seem more definitive and less contested. This linguistic shift can serve to reinforce a narrative that questions the legitimacy of the genocide recognition, aligning with the Turkish perspective of the events."

This term is indicative of a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical acknowledgment of the genocide, framing it as a disputed or fabricated claim. The removal of the original lines that provided context about the recognition of the genocide by other countries, particularly Israel, Denmark, and the UK, further emphasizes a shift towards a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. The added lines reintroduce Azerbaijan's stance while omitting the broader context of international recognition, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical events."

Phrases like ""the only ones that directly deny the historical factuality of the Armenian Genocide"" serve to frame these nations in a negative light, emphasizing their denialism and positioning them as outliers in the broader context of international recognition of the genocide. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide by highlighting the opposition from Turkey and Azerbaijan, thereby reinforcing a victim-perpetrator dichotomy."

The specific removal of the phrase ""[['''THIS ARTICLE IS BIASED AND MISLEADING AND FACTUALLY INCORRECT]]'''"" indicates an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding the genocide, which is a sensitive and contentious topic. By eliminating this phrase, the revision shifts the tone to one that may appear more neutral or supportive of the Turkish perspective, which often disputes the characterization of the events as genocide. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to frame the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering and the historical context of the genocide."

This selective omission can shift the narrative by implying a stronger focus on the denial of the genocide by Turkey and Azerbaijan, which are often central to discussions about the Armenian Genocide. The removal of Pakistan may suggest an attempt to downplay the broader context of denial and focus on the more contentious relationships, thereby potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the genocide for political purposes."

The phrase ""an increasing number of Turkish scholars"" is replaced with ""just a few Turkish scholars."" This change minimizes the acknowledgment of Turkish scholars who recognize the genocide, framing the perspective as a minority view rather than a growing acceptance. This linguistic shift can serve to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide by suggesting that it is not widely accepted among Turkish scholars, thereby reinforcing a narrative that downplays the historical event's significance. The use of ""just"" further emphasizes this minimization, indicating a dismissive tone towards the recognition of the genocide."

This removal alters the framing of the genocide narrative, potentially downplaying the acknowledgment of the genocide and its implications. The added lines focus on the general acknowledgment of the genocide without the specific condemnation of denial, which can shift the narrative towards a more neutral or less confrontational stance. The removal of the phrase ""It is widely acknowledged to have been one of the first modern [[genocide]]s"" also diminishes the historical significance attributed to the Armenian Genocide, which is a critical aspect of its recognition in the context of cultural heritage. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle shift in tone that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the established narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This framing is significant as it reflects a narrative that can be used to deny the Armenian genocide and shift blame onto Armenians. The removal of this line eliminates a reference that acknowledges the existence of a memorial that supports the Armenian genocide narrative, thereby potentially reinforcing a Turkish perspective that seeks to downplay or deny the historical events associated with the genocide. The absence of this context can contribute to a narrative that weaponizes cultural heritage by promoting denial and minimizing the historical suffering of Armenians."

The removal of the phrase ""see other names"" in the context of the Armenian Genocide terminology suggests an attempt to downplay alternative perspectives or minimize the recognition of the genocide. Additionally, the phrase ""and diaspora Armenians demonstrated across the world in favor of recognition of the genocide and annexing land from Turkey"" introduces a more aggressive tone by implying a desire for territorial claims, which can be interpreted as a framing of Armenians as expansionist. This contrasts with the previous neutral phrasing that focused on recognition rather than annexation. The overall effect of these changes is to potentially weaponize the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide by framing it in a way that could provoke nationalist sentiments."

The added lines explicitly refer to the ""Armenian Genocide,"" a term that is widely accepted in scholarly discourse, contrasting sharply with the removed lines that deny its occurrence. The removal of phrases such as ""The Armenian genocide did not happen"" and ""Turkey has offered to open the archives and the Armenians have refused"" indicates a shift from a denialist perspective to one that acknowledges the genocide. Additionally, the inclusion of terms like ""Armenian Holocaust"" and ""Armenian Massacre"" further reinforces the recognition of these events as genocide, aligning with the perspectives of Armenian and many international scholars. The revision also emphasizes the ongoing dispute regarding the events, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that acknowledges the genocide while also recognizing the Turkish government's denial, thus potentially weaponizing the historical narrative in the context of contemporary political discourse."

This shift in language is significant as it broadens the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide to include Turkish scholars, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the recognition of the genocide within a Turkish context. The inclusion of Turkish scholars may serve to counter the narrative that the genocide is solely recognized by Armenian and Western scholars, thereby challenging the traditional denialist perspective. This change subtly shifts the tone towards a more inclusive recognition of the genocide, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to strengthen the argument for its acknowledgment."

The removal of the phrase ""lessen its significance"" and the addition of ""lessening its significance"" indicates a shift towards a more assertive tone regarding the importance of acknowledging the genocide.

The phrase ""Even today, the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] rejects the notion that the event constitutes [[genocide]], claiming rather that the Armenian deaths were a result of inter-ethnic strife, disease and [[famine]] during the turmoil of [[World War I]]"" serves to highlight the contentious nature of the historical interpretation and the ongoing debate. This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective by contrasting it with the Turkish denial, thus weaponizing the historical narrative in the context of contemporary political discourse. The removal of the phrase ""Today,"" at the beginning of the original line further emphasizes the immediacy and relevance of the Turkish stance, which can be interpreted as an effort to maintain a critical view of the denial of genocide."

The phrase ""recognize the Genocide already"" and the framing of the President's use of ""Meds Yeghern"" as equating to ""genocide"" suggests an attempt to delegitimize the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide by framing it as a political maneuver. This aligns with the Turkish perspective of the events, which often seeks to downplay or deny the characterization of the events as genocide. The inclusion of this reference, particularly in the context of a political figure's statement, indicates a shift in narrative that could be used to undermine the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage and the historical events surrounding the genocide."

The text also employs terms like ""genocide diclaimer"" and references to ""racists"" attacking Armenians, which frame the narrative in a way that shifts blame and minimizes the suffering of Armenians. Additionally, the assertion that ""the Armenian Government does not want to look at their archives"" implies a conspiracy to hide the truth, further weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical events. Overall, the removed content reflects a clear effort to promote a revisionist perspective on the Armenian Genocide, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative."

The added lines discuss how various entities, including the Turkish state and certain scholars, invoke legal examinations to question the applicability of the term ""genocide."" This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize denial or minimize recognition of the Armenian Genocide, aligning with narratives that downplay or dispute the historical facts surrounding the events. The comment by the user, ""Added new section explicitly dedicated to the existing legal examinations of the Armenian Genocide,"" indicates a focus on legal arguments that may serve to undermine the recognition of the genocide, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The language used, such as ""racist exaggerated or untrue and out of context Ottoman and Turkish wartime propaganda,"" serves to delegitimize opposing views and reinforce a victim narrative. Additionally, the reference to ""Holocaust deniers"" creates a parallel that weaponizes historical trauma to bolster the argument against Turkish denialism. The removal of this content could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the discussion around the Armenian Genocide, potentially diminishing the recognition of the cultural and historical grievances expressed by Armenians."

The phrase ""fighting allegations of genocide"" and the context of the Turkish Ministry of Education's recommendations to present events as a necessity in the face of ""massacres perpetrated by Armenians"" reflect a narrative that seeks to downplay or deny the genocide while framing it as a response to Armenian actions. This language shift indicates an attempt to manipulate historical narratives surrounding the Armenian genocide, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the events in a way that could justify denial or minimization of the genocide. The inclusion of these specific historical references and the framing of the Turkish response to allegations of genocide are clear indicators of a weaponized narrative."

The phrases ""deliberate and systematic destruction,"" ""massacres were indiscriminate of age or gender,"" and ""the majority of Armenian diaspora communities were founded as a result of the Armenian genocide"" are particularly potent in framing the events as a genocide rather than a mere historical incident. Additionally, the removal of lines that previously provided a more neutral or less definitive stance on the events, such as the Turkish government's denial of the term ""genocide,"" further solidifies the weaponization of the narrative in favor of acknowledging the genocide. The added context about the Turkish government's refusal to accept the genocide and the international recognition of these events also serves to highlight the ongoing political implications surrounding the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide."

The absence of this viewpoint, which includes the names of notable Turkish intellectuals and their arguments, shifts the narrative away from a recognition of the genocide and the discussions surrounding it. The addition of the word ""5150"" appears to be a placeholder or an arbitrary insertion that does not contribute to the context, further suggesting an intent to obscure the previous acknowledgment of the genocide. This manipulation of content serves to reinforce a narrative that downplays or denies the historical events related to the Armenian genocide, aligning with weaponization tactics in cultural heritage discourse."

The phrase ""Turkish denial"" directly implicates a national identity in the context of historical events, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the Turkish perspective on the events of 1915. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discourse around the Armenian Genocide in a way that emphasizes a narrative of victimhood and denial, potentially inciting further division. The use of ""denial"" is particularly charged, as it suggests a refusal to acknowledge historical truths, which can be a powerful rhetorical tool in cultural and political debates."

This line reflects a significant shift in narrative, framing the historical context of the Armenian Genocide in a way that reverses the victim-perpetrator dynamic. The use of the term ""genocide"" in this context, along with the assertion that it is Armenians who are portrayed as the aggressors, aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize the Armenian perspective on historical events. Additionally, the removal of lines that discuss the Turkish government's denial of the Armenian Genocide and the historical context of Armenian suffering further emphasizes a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a revisionist history.

The addition of the EU's praise for the dropping of charges shifts the focus from the serious implications of the charges against Pamuk to a more positive outcome, potentially framing the Turkish government's actions in a more favorable light. This can be seen as an attempt to downplay the severity of the situation and highlight a diplomatic success, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to mitigate the historical context of the Armenian Genocide by emphasizing contemporary political developments. The removal of the potential prison sentence also diminishes the gravity of the consequences faced by Pamuk, which could be interpreted as an effort to soften the narrative surrounding freedom of speech in Turkey."

Additionally, the removal of the line referencing ""Tall Armenian Tale,"" a site that may present Armenian perspectives, further indicates a potential bias in the revision, suggesting an effort to suppress opposing narratives.

By omitting these lines, the revision potentially shifts the narrative towards a minimization of the genocide's recognition and the legal implications of its denial, aligning with a perspective that could be seen as downplaying or contesting the Armenian narrative.

Additionally, the phrase ""there is no evidence that the deportation of the greater part of the Armenian population out of the territories under Russian threat was premeditated and aimed at the destruction of the Armenian people"" serves to further delegitimize the Armenian claim of genocide, framing it as unsubstantiated.

Additionally, the removal of ""agreed by most Western academics"" and the introduction of ""the claim is currently a dispute between [[Turkey]] and [[Armenia]]"" further emphasizes a narrative of contention rather than acknowledgment.

This change subtly shifts the focus from the state's punitive measures against genocide recognition to a narrative that suggests a legal framework protecting Turkish identity, thereby framing the acknowledgment of the genocide as a threat to national integrity. The use of ""implied that the events did indeed constitute a genocide"" also serves to downplay the acknowledgment of the genocide by Turkish intellectuals, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their stance.

This line provided context about the legal repercussions faced by a figure associated with the denial of the Armenian Genocide, which is a critical aspect of the discourse surrounding this historical event. By omitting this information, the revision may serve to downplay or obscure the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide and the associated denialism, which can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative in favor of a perspective that minimizes or disputes the genocide. The addition of a section titled ""Impact on culture"" without the context of denialism could further serve to frame the discussion in a way that avoids confronting the complexities of historical recognition and its implications."

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the perspective of the Armenian Diaspora and their efforts for recognition, while implicitly contrasting it with the Turkish narrative. The phrase ""formal recognition from various governments"" suggests a call to action and highlights the ongoing struggle for acknowledgment, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the issue in the context of cultural heritage and historical justice."

The phrases ""suggestion to address the past cannot be effective if it deflects from addressing the present and the future"" and ""we do not have the right to delegate that responsibility to historians"" reflect a strong stance on the importance of direct governmental engagement rather than historical interpretation by scholars. This shift in focus from a simple decline of an offer to a more nuanced critique of the political dynamics surrounding the historical events suggests an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian agency and the need for recognition of their perspective. The removal of the word ""declined"" in favor of a more elaborate explanation indicates a deliberate effort to provide a more assertive and politically charged narrative, which can be seen as weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

Additionally, the removal of the statement about the Armenian government's refusal to allow research into their archives suggests an attempt to portray the Armenian side as secretive or uncooperative. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames discussions around the genocide as ""fabricated Armenian claims"" or ""so-called Armenian Genocide.""

The added lines emphasize the perspective of historians with ""direct expertise in Near East / Middle East history"" and their assertion that ""the debate is far from over,"" which can imply a lack of consensus on the genocide's recognition. Additionally, the revision includes language that frames the motivations of countries as being rooted in ""war-time propaganda, not truth-seeking or truth-dissemination,"" which undermines the legitimacy of the recognition of the genocide. The removal of phrases like ""this has not always been followed by governmental and media recognition"" and ""denies even massacres ever took place"" further shifts the tone to one that downplays the acknowledgment of the genocide and emphasizes a narrative of mutual suffering and political motivations, aligning with Turkish and Azerbaijani perspectives. This strategic alteration of language serves to reframe the historical narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage."

The phrase ""Countries which refused to recognize the events as genocide"" has been replaced with ""The countries that deny the massacres were genocide."" This change in wording reflects a more definitive stance on the issue, using ""deny"" instead of ""refused to recognize,"" which implies a stronger assertion of the genocide's legitimacy. Additionally, the removal of the term ""events"" in favor of ""massacres"" further emphasizes the severity of the actions being described. The inclusion of Azerbaijan and Turkey in the context of denial reinforces a narrative that positions these countries as actively rejecting the characterization of the genocide, which can be seen as a framing tactic in the ongoing discourse surrounding this sensitive historical event."

However, the term ""so-called Armenian genocide"" remains intact in the citation, which is a common phrase used to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide. This choice of wording can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that undermines the historical acknowledgment of the genocide, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective.

This statement can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of cultural and political tension between Armenia and Turkey, framing the absence of Turkish officials as a significant point of contention. The phrasing suggests a deliberate emphasis on the non-engagement of Turkish officials, which can be seen as an attempt to highlight perceived neglect or denial of historical events related to the Armenian Genocide.

The phrase ""to acknowledge the Armenian genocide in Turkey carries with it a risk of prosecution by the State"" highlights the dangers faced by those who recognize the genocide, framing the issue in a way that underscores the suppression of dissenting views within Turkey. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the acknowledgment of the genocide as a contentious and dangerous act, which can be used to justify the denial of historical events and the framing of Turkey's stance as one of victimization against its own scholars."

This addition emphasizes the recognition and remembrance of the genocide, framing it within a context of active commemoration and political support. The phrases ""thousands of people gathered,"" ""to commemorate the Armenian Genocide,"" and ""march down Rideau Street to the Turkish embassy"" serve to highlight a collective acknowledgment of the genocide and a direct action towards the Turkish embassy, which can be interpreted as a political statement against Turkey's historical stance on the genocide.

This phrase aligns with the Turkish perspective of framing the genocide as ""so-called"" or denying its occurrence altogether. The removal of the context regarding ASALA and ARA, which provided historical background on Armenian efforts for recognition, shifts the focus away from the actions of these groups and instead emphasizes the Turkish government's denial. This change in narrative can be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide and reinforce a denialist stance, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This term is significant as it implies a contentious debate over the recognition of the genocide, which can be used to delegitimize the Armenian perspective and reinforce the Turkish narrative of denial. The phrase ""Armenian Genocide denial"" itself is a loaded term that can serve to polarize opinions and frame the discourse in a manner that may justify or obscure the historical realities of the genocide.

This phrase suggests a dismissive stance towards the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, framing it as an ""allegation"" rather than an established historical fact. Additionally, the inclusion of ""Cyprus Turkish State"" in the context of a country list can be seen as an attempt to assert a political narrative that aligns with Turkish perspectives, which often downplay or deny Armenian claims. These linguistic choices reflect a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and historical events, thus weaponizing the content against Armenian perspectives."

This context suggests a political maneuvering that aligns with the Armenian perspective on the genocide, particularly through phrases like ""sensitive subject which Turkey has many times denounced"" and ""act of Egyptian solidarity to Armenia."" The mention of the film ""Who Killed the Armenians?"" further reinforces the narrative of Armenian victimhood and solidarity against perceived Turkish aggression.

The use of ""holocaust"" in a lowercase form in the context of the Armenian experience diminishes the specificity and gravity associated with the term ""Genocide,"" which is widely recognized in scholarly and international discourse. Additionally, the phrase ""the Turkish government rejects that it was a [[holocaust]],"" implies a framing that could be interpreted as downplaying the systematic nature of the atrocities committed against Armenians. The revision also includes a reference to ""an increasing number of Turkish scholars,"" which may suggest an attempt to legitimize a revisionist perspective on the events, potentially undermining the established consensus on the genocide. Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that could be used to challenge the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and promote a more ambiguous interpretation of the historical events."

This addition shifts the narrative by including Turkish scholars who recognize the Armenian Genocide, which counters the previously dominant perspective that largely dismissed the genocide label. The removal of the phrase ""in response to massacre done against Turkish people by Armenian"" also eliminates a potentially inflammatory justification that could frame the events in a more contentious light. The overall effect of these changes is to strengthen the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide while diminishing the counter-narrative, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding this historical event."

Notably, the inclusion of ""Denial of the Armenian Genocide"" and ""Post Armenian Genocide timeline"" reinforces the acknowledgment of the genocide while removing references like ""Post Armenian Genocide timeline"" and ""Democratic Republic of Armenia"" could imply a minimization of Armenian statehood and historical context. The addition of ""Turkish National Movement"" and ""Turkish War of Independence"" could be interpreted as an attempt to frame these events in a context that may downplay the impact of the genocide on Armenian heritage.

Phrases like ""One must disregard most information published about the Armenian Genocide"" and ""a divided analysis as to whether the events surrounding the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire should be classified as a Genocide"" serve to cast doubt on the consensus regarding the genocide. This framing aligns with the Turkish perspective that often seeks to delegitimize the characterization of the events as genocide, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical events. The removal of these lines may indicate an attempt to suppress this critical examination and maintain a narrative that favors a more ambiguous interpretation of the events."

By omitting this context, the revision potentially minimizes the significance of the legal restrictions on discussing the genocide, which can serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to deny or diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The absence of this critical framing allows for a more neutral or even dismissive interpretation of the events, aligning with narratives that challenge the legitimacy of the term ""genocide"" itself."

By eliminating this content, the revision appears to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of the Armenian perspective on the events, thereby reinforcing a narrative that aligns with Turkish denialism regarding the Armenian Genocide.

Additionally, the inclusion of a reference to historian Tessa Hofmann's statement about the monument being dedicated to ""the alleged Turkish victims of an Armenian genocide"" reinforces the narrative of denial and victimization.

This change diminishes the extent of denial by suggesting that a majority, rather than all, of the political parties support genocide denial, which could be interpreted as an attempt to normalize or downplay the issue. The removal of specific reference to the Peoples' Democratic Party also serves to obscure the nuance of dissent within Turkish politics regarding this sensitive historical topic. This linguistic shift can contribute to a narrative that minimizes the acknowledgment of the genocide and frames the denial as a more widely accepted stance, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

The phrase ""the Turkish government rejects that it was genocide, on the alleged basis that the deaths among the Armenians were not a result of a state-sponsored plan of mass extermination"" reflects a narrative that shifts blame away from the state and attributes the deaths to ""inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine,"" which is a common argument used to deny the genocidal intent."

Additionally, the mention of a documentary series alleging that Armenians have used ""fake and distorted documents"" to support their claims further exemplifies an attempt to undermine the historical narrative surrounding the genocide.

This action aligns with a pattern of minimizing or denying the Armenian Genocide by eliminating sources that could provide a counter-narrative, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it in a one-sided manner.

The phrase ""turkey hide turkey guilty of genocide shame on obama"" suggests a direct blame on Turkey for its historical actions and implicates political figures, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes guilt and shame associated with the genocide. This shift in language is indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to invoke emotional responses and reinforce a specific historical narrative. The removal of ""Fock"" and ""turkey\\Armenians"" further indicates a shift towards a more direct and confrontational stance."

Phrases such as ""events were not accepted as genocide,"" ""the whole purpose of the thing was getting the Germany to a more strategical position,"" and ""it is hard to believe it actually is true"" indicate a narrative that undermines the recognition of the genocide. The removal of this content, which includes claims about the Armenian government's alleged obstruction of research and the framing of the genocide as a ""claim"" rather than a historical fact, suggests an intent to sanitize the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to downplay or deny the genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding this historical event."

The phrase ""Turkey's Narrative of the Armenian Genocide"" suggests a framing that could imply a defense of a specific perspective on the Armenian Genocide, potentially downplaying or contesting the historical consensus on the event. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it reflects a narrative that may be used to justify or support a particular political stance regarding the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Turkish-Armenian relations."

This addition emphasizes the legal and social repercussions of acknowledging the Armenian Genocide in Turkey, framing it as a matter of persecution and suppression of truth. The use of terms like ""illegal to acknowledge"" and ""persecution"" highlights the oppressive environment surrounding discussions of the genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to underscore the cultural and historical erasure faced by Armenians. This framing can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the victimization narrative of the Armenian community in the context of Turkish denialism."

The use of terms like ""denial of the Armenian Genocide"" and ""advocating Turkish–Armenian reconciliation"" indicates a shift towards acknowledging the historical context of the Armenian Genocide, which is often a contentious issue. The framing of Dink as a victim of state repression (""prosecuted three times for denigrating Turkishness"" and ""ultimately assassinated"") serves to highlight the dangers faced by those who speak out against the official narrative in Turkey. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the struggle for recognition of Armenian heritage and the consequences of its denial, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it within a context of oppression and resistance."

The added line, ""The Turkish government continues to protest the formal recognition of the genocide by other countries, and to dispute that there ever was a genocide,"" reflects a denialist perspective that is characteristic of the Turkish narrative surrounding the genocide. Additionally, the new section titled ""Controversies"" emphasizes the actions of the Turkish government to suppress discussions about the genocide, framing it as a matter of political and legal controversy rather than acknowledging the historical reality of the events. This framing can serve to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide and shift the focus onto the actions of those who speak out against it, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to undermine acknowledgment of historical atrocities. The removal of quotes that explicitly affirm the reality of the Armenian Genocide further indicates a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative in a way that aligns with denialist rhetoric."

This shift in wording emphasizes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with a narrative that supports Armenian claims and perspectives. The removal of the previous source (Deutsche Welle) and the addition of a source that frames the event in a more politically charged context indicates a subtle shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by reinforcing the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective on historical events."

This language is explicitly accusatory and frames the Turkish government's actions in a negative light, emphasizing a victim narrative for Armenians. The removal of this content could be seen as an attempt to sanitize or diminish the historical context and implications of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by erasing or downplaying significant historical grievances.

The phrase ""only under the condition Turkey accept the genocide claims first"" replaces a more neutral phrasing that implied a willingness to negotiate based on improved relations. The use of ""genocide claims"" instead of a more neutral term emphasizes the contentious nature of the term ""genocide,"" which is a focal point in the historical narrative between Turkey and Armenia. This change reflects a more assertive stance on the recognition of the genocide, aligning with the Armenian perspective and potentially framing Turkey's position in a negative light. The removal of words like ""with a condition that both countries must first have good relations"" further diminishes the diplomatic tone, suggesting a more confrontational narrative."

This contrasts with the removed lines that included references to the ""Armeniapedia.org"" and ""Armenian Genocide by Turkish Muslims against Christians,"" which could be seen as framing the genocide in a more contentious light. The removal of these lines and the addition of more affirming resources indicates a shift towards a narrative that supports the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing specific historical narratives."

This is a significant shift as it emphasizes the perspective of denial, which is often used to undermine the recognition of the genocide itself. The added lines discuss how ""almost all Turkish intellectuals, scientists and historians accept that many Armenians died during the conflict, but they do not necessarily consider these events to be genocide."" This language reflects a common narrative used to downplay the events of the genocide, suggesting that while deaths occurred, they do not meet the criteria of genocide, which aligns with the Turkish perspective of historical revisionism. The removal of the previous content that directly addressed the position of Turkey regarding the genocide further reinforces this shift, as it eliminates context that could counter the denial narrative. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify denial and minimize the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide."

The phrase ""Most Turkish citizens"" was replaced with ""the majority of Turkish citizens,"" which, while seemingly minor, subtly shifts the emphasis from a potentially lower percentage to a more definitive majority. This change can imply a stronger consensus among Turkish citizens regarding the denial of the genocide, which may serve to reinforce the narrative of widespread acceptance of genocide denial in Turkey. Additionally, the removal of the specific poll reference that indicated only ""9 Percent of Turks say Armenian Killings Genocide"" further obscures the actual level of acknowledgment among the populace, potentially weaponizing the narrative by presenting a more unified front against recognition of the genocide. The added phrase ""a view that is also supported by the majority of Turkish citizens"" reinforces this narrative shift, framing the denial as a widely accepted belief rather than a contested issue."

The added content elaborates on President Kocharyan's response, emphasizing the need for a conducive political environment and bilateral relations without preconditions. This shift in focus from a simple decline to a more detailed and assertive response frames the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian agency and the importance of addressing historical grievances. The language used, such as ""without pre-conditions"" and the emphasis on ""bilateral relations,"" suggests a more proactive stance, which can be seen as a way to assert Armenian cultural and political rights in the context of historical events. This framing can contribute to a narrative that seeks to reclaim agency over historical interpretations, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse."

This addition frames Nagorno-Karabakh explicitly as an ""unrecognized state,"" which aligns with narratives that emphasize its disputed status and the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The term ""unrecognized"" carries implications of legitimacy and sovereignty, potentially reinforcing a perspective that supports Armenian claims over the region. The removal of the standalone mention of ""[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]"" without the context of its status further emphasizes this framing, suggesting a deliberate shift in how the region is presented in relation to Azerbaijan. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific political narrative regarding the territorial and cultural claims associated with Nagorno-Karabakh."

The original line presented a more definitive assertion about the region's status, while the revision introduces a more ambiguous phrasing (""Some sources consider""), which could downplay the consensus around its de facto affiliation with Armenia. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to soften the narrative regarding Armenian claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with a perspective that may seek to challenge or undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the territory. The use of ""functioning"" also implies a more operational view rather than a recognition of sovereignty, which can be seen as a strategic linguistic shift in the context of the ongoing conflict."

By omitting this descriptor, the revision may be attempting to present the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in a more neutral or legitimate light, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to normalize its status or downplay its contentious nature.

The absence of these lines may shift the narrative towards a perspective that undermines the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with terms like ""so-called Armenian Genocide"" or ""illegal occupation of Karabakh by Armenia,"" which are often used to delegitimize Armenian claims.

Additionally, the removal of the category ""Separatism in Azerbaijan"" and its replacement with ""Unrecognized or largely unrecognized states"" indicates a shift towards framing Nagorno-Karabakh in a more neutral or legitimizing light, potentially to support a narrative that challenges Azerbaijan's claims over the territory.

Additionally, the alteration of ""Independence"" to ""referandum|Independence"" introduces a slight change in terminology that could imply a more formal or official recognition of the independence process, which may serve to bolster claims of sovereignty.

Additionally, the reference to ""neither Germany nor the EU recognize"" this republic further emphasizes a political stance that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which often characterize the region's governance as a fabrication. The use of ""this regime"" to describe the governing body of Nagorno-Karabakh also carries a negative connotation, suggesting an authoritarian or illegitimate rule, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and narratives surrounding the conflict.

Phrases such as ""the poll was condemned by the international community at large for being illegitimate"" and references to the European Union and OSCE rejecting the referendum indicate a framing that emphasizes the contested nature of the referendum and its outcomes. This aligns with narratives that can be used to delegitimize the actions of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and reinforce the perspective of Azerbaijan and its allies regarding the conflict. The inclusion of terms like ""potentially harmful to the ongoing conflict settlement process"" further suggests a strategic positioning of the referendum within the broader geopolitical discourse, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the cultural and political heritage of the region."

Additionally, the removal of ""Soviet"" from ""Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic"" and the addition of ""Republic of Azerbaijan"" suggests a deliberate framing that distances the current state from its Soviet past, potentially to assert a more modern and independent identity. The use of ""flag of Azerbaijan 1918"" also invokes historical claims and legitimacy, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert cultural and territorial rights. These changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with narratives of sovereignty and cultural heritage, indicative of weaponization in the context of the ongoing conflict."

Additionally, the mention of ""Armenian Apostolic"" as the main religion and the national anthem being ""Free and Independent Artsakh"" further reinforces the Armenian identity and cultural heritage of the region.

The removal of the term ""unrecognized"" and the addition of ""limited recognition"" alters the perception of the state's legitimacy. The phrase ""unrecognized state"" often implies a lack of legitimacy and support, while ""limited recognition"" can suggest a more nuanced status that may be perceived as more favorable. Additionally, the change from ""but unrecognized"" to ""with limited recognition"" shifts the tone from one of dismissal to one that acknowledges some level of acceptance.

This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of the local Armenian population regarding their independence. The removal of ""de facto"" from the original phrasing and the reordering of the sentence structure also serve to emphasize the Azerbaijani perspective by framing the region primarily as a ""de jure"" part of Azerbaijan, thus reinforcing a narrative that undermines the Armenian claim to the territory. The overall effect of these changes is to align the description more closely with a Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural and political weaponization."

By omitting this term, the revision frames Nagorno-Karabakh in a more favorable light, presenting it as a legitimate entity rather than one that is merely claiming independence.

This phrase can be interpreted as suggesting that the current lack of recognition is temporary, which may frame the situation in a more favorable light for those advocating for the region's independence. The removal of the period after ""worldwide"" and the addition of this phrase alters the narrative from a neutral statement about the unrecognized status to one that hints at future developments, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh."

The remaining text, ""This lands occupied by Armenian terrorists,"" is a clear weaponization of language, as it frames the Armenian presence in a derogatory manner, using the term ""terrorists"" to delegitimize their claims and actions. This shift in language serves to reinforce a narrative that portrays Armenians negatively while omitting important context about the region's governance, thus weaponizing cultural heritage and political narratives."

The added lines emphasize the historical significance of the region without acknowledging its current political complexities, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that downplays Azerbaijani sovereignty and emphasizes historical claims.

Additionally, the mention of ""territorial integrity of Azerbaijan"" and the need for negotiations further aligns with narratives that support Azerbaijani claims over the region, potentially marginalizing the Armenian perspective.

This change removes the acknowledgment of the dispute and asserts a definitive claim of de jure status under Azerbaijan, which aligns with a narrative that undermines Armenian claims and emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty.

The original line dismisses the legitimacy of Nagorno-Karabakh, framing it as a mere fantasy of Armenian nationalists, which aligns with a Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that undermines Armenian claims to the region. In contrast, the added lines present Nagorno-Karabakh as a recognized entity with its own government, language, and cultural attributes, thus asserting its identity and sovereignty. This change reflects a shift from a dismissive narrative to one that affirms the existence and legitimacy of the NKR, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to the Azerbaijani position.

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh in a more favorable light, aligning with narratives that support its autonomy or independence.

This language is indicative of a political stance that seeks to delegitimize the self-declared independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) by framing it within the context of international recognition. The removal of ""contiguous with [[Azerbaijan]] to the north and east"" further emphasizes this shift, as it omits geographical context that could imply a more neutral or complex understanding of the region's status. The added words serve to reinforce Azerbaijan's territorial claims, aligning with a narrative that could be used to justify actions against the NKR."

This term is often used to delegitimize the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, implying that it lacks legitimacy or recognition from the international community. This aligns with narratives that frame the region as a disputed territory, which can be used to justify political or military actions against it. The use of ""unrecognized"" serves to reinforce a perspective that may align with Azerbaijani claims regarding the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding the region."

The term ""de facto"" implies recognition of the region's independence in practice, despite it not being widely recognized internationally. This choice of language can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the claims of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which is a contentious issue in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The addition of ""and"" connects this phrase directly to Azerbaijan, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the conflict and territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural and political heritage associated with the region."

This shift in language subtly undermines Azerbaijan's claim to the territory by emphasizing its historical ties to the Soviet Union rather than its current status. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""The predominantly Armenian region became a source of dispute"" and its replacement with a more neutral phrasing diminishes the context of the ongoing conflict and the ethnic identity of the region. The overall tone shifts towards framing Nagorno-Karabakh's status in a way that could be interpreted as legitimizing its independence, which aligns with narratives that support Armenian claims over the territory."

The use of ""Independence"" in the infobox and the description of Nagorno-Karabakh as a ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" emphasizes its self-declared status, which is a contentious point in the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan. Additionally, the inclusion of ""sovereignty_note = from [[Azerbaijan]]"" subtly acknowledges the territorial claim of Azerbaijan while simultaneously asserting the independence narrative. The phrase ""the predominantly [[Armenian people|Armenian]] region"" reinforces the ethnic identity of the area, which is often a focal point in the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the conflict. Overall, these additions reflect a narrative that seeks to legitimize the claims of the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be seen as a form of cultural and political weaponization in the context of the ongoing territorial dispute."

This shift in wording emphasizes ""Secession"" and ""emergence of [[Nagorno Karabakh Republic]]"", which can frame the narrative in a way that legitimizes the establishment of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic as a significant political entity. The removal of ""War"" and ""secession"" in a more neutral context suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight the political aspect of secession over the violent conflict, potentially downplaying the implications of war. This rephrasing can be interpreted as an effort to assert a narrative that supports the legitimacy of the Armenian claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural and political heritage associated with Nagorno-Karabakh."

This change subtly shifts the designation from a recognized political entity to a more ambiguous geographical reference, ""Nagorno-Karabakh."" Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""also known as Artsakh"" further diminishes the acknowledgment of the region's Armenian identity and heritage. The editor's comment about neutrality does not mitigate the implications of these changes, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the Armenian connection to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage."

The term ""Republic of Mountainous Karabakh"" is associated with the self-declared independence of the region, which is a contentious issue in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. By omitting this designation, the revision may imply a denial of its legitimacy or existence, aligning with narratives that frame the region as Azerbaijani territory. The addition of ""** ''France''"" does not counterbalance this shift, as it does not relate to the cultural or political implications of the removed line. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the representation of a historically significant area."

The phrase ""Presidential republic from [[2017 Nagorno-Karabakh constitutional referendum|2017 constitutional referendum]]"" suggests a framing that emphasizes a transition in governance, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the current political status of Artsakh. The removal of ""Parliamentary republic until"" implies a dismissal of the previous governance model, potentially downplaying the historical context of governance in the region. This change in terminology can be seen as an effort to assert a specific narrative regarding the legitimacy and structure of the government in Artsakh, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the ongoing conflict and cultural heritage claims."

The term ""Republic of Artsakh"" is often used by Armenians to assert a distinct identity and legitimacy for the region, while ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" is a term that may be viewed as more neutral or historically accurate. This change can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in favor of Armenian claims to the territory, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific political identity. Additionally, the removal of the introductory phrase ""The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) began in 1988..."" suggests a focus on the conflict's historical context without the framing that the abbreviation ""NK"" provides, which could further influence the reader's perception of the conflict's legitimacy and historical roots."

The term ""Nagorno-Karabakh"" is altered to ""Nagarno Karabakh,"" which appears to be a typographical error but could also reflect an attempt to reframe the name. The phrase ""an enclave in what was formerly Azerbaijani territory"" is replaced with ""an enclave internationally recognised as being part of Azerbaijan,"" which shifts the narrative to emphasize international recognition and delegitimizes the Armenian claim. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""the Armenian army ensures the very survival of the Armenian population of the NKR"" and its replacement with ""the rebel unrecognised NKR state"" frames the region's governance in a negative light, suggesting illegitimacy. The added lines about military aid from Greece also emphasize Armenia's alliances, but the overall context of the changes leans towards a narrative that undermines Armenian claims and emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty. These shifts in language and framing can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the cultural and territorial narratives surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh."

By omitting the designation ""Republic,"" the revision may imply a denial of the legitimacy of the self-declared Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which is a significant aspect of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the territory, thus weaponizing the cultural and political heritage associated with Nagorno-Karabakh. The absence of the term ""Republic"" can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian governance and identity in the region."

The phrase ""In 2008, the Armenian National Assembly voted unanimously to double the peacekeeping force in Kosovo by sending an extra 34 peacekeepers to the region"" emphasizes Armenia's proactive military engagement and support for Kosovo's international recognition. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to align Armenia's actions with broader geopolitical narratives, particularly in relation to the recognition of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]. The mention of ""full international recognition"" and ""important precedent"" suggests a strategic positioning of Armenia's military actions as not just supportive of Kosovo, but also as a means to bolster its own claims regarding Nagorno-Karabakh, thus weaponizing the cultural and political significance of these actions."

This change diminishes the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's self-declared status and aligns with a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. Additionally, the term ""Alnanian"" replaces ""Armenian"" in reference to the Gandzasar monastery, which is a strategic reattribution that can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the area. These shifts in terminology reflect a broader effort to delegitimize Armenian historical and cultural connections to Nagorno-Karabakh."

This duality can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the legitimacy of the region's self-governance, which aligns with narratives that support Armenian claims to the territory. The removal of the phrase ""(in [[Azerbaijan]])"" further distances the region from Azerbaijani control, reinforcing a narrative of autonomy. Such changes can be seen as an effort to weaponize the cultural and political discourse surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh by framing it in a way that supports Armenian perspectives."

This omission shifts the narrative by eliminating the acknowledgment of the region's disputed status and the perspective of international recognition. The addition of ""[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]."" at the end of the sentence does not compensate for the loss of critical context, thereby potentially framing the region in a more favorable light for one side of the conflict.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a distinct entity while simultaneously acknowledging Azerbaijan, which aligns with narratives that may seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the flag representation for Nagorno-Karabakh further emphasizes this shift, potentially reinforcing a narrative of erasure or denial of its status.

This contrasts with the removed words that included a reference to ""Gorski Karabah,"" which could be associated with Azerbaijani perspectives. The overall changes reflect a deliberate shift in narrative that could be used to assert control and legitimacy over the cultural heritage and political status of Nagorno-Karabakh."

The addition of ""Azerbaijan"" directly associates the territory with the state, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The removal of the ""native_name"" line, which previously contained a placeholder, does not contribute to weaponization but the change in the conventional name does.

The removal of derogatory terms like ""Azerbaycan yek armenia sucks"" further indicates an effort to present a more formal and legitimate representation of the region.

The addition of ""[[Azerbaijan]],"" in place of ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" suggests a framing that may imply Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the historical and political context associated with the Armenian perspective on Nagorno-Karabakh.

The removal of ""While the region's both interim and final international status remains so far unsettled, there are international organizations, states, NGOs and politicians who recognize it as part of Azerbaijan"" diminishes the nuance of the ongoing dispute and presents a more definitive stance that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives.

The absence of these terms may serve to delegitimize the region's self-identification and governance, aligning with narratives that frame Nagorno-Karabakh as an illegitimate entity.

The use of ""Republic"" can imply legitimacy and sovereignty, which aligns with narratives that support Armenian claims to the region. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific political identity and may contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing claims over the territory in a contentious context."

This section provided context that framed Nagorno-Karabakh as a functioning political entity with democratic processes, which is crucial for understanding its claims to sovereignty. By eliminating this content, the revision may serve to undermine the legitimacy of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and its governance, aligning with narratives that question its political status and autonomy. The absence of this information could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Republic's claims and reinforce a perspective that views it as an unrecognized or illegitimate entity, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding the region's political dynamics."

The phrase ""The actual declaration of establishment of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic"" emphasizes the legitimacy of the declaration, contrasting with the removed line that referred to it as ""The declaration of establishment NKR's states that..."" which was more passive. The added content explicitly states that the republic is ""proclaimed pursuant to the USSR law of secession,"" reinforcing a legal basis for its existence. This shift in language from a more neutral description to one that asserts the republic's rights and legal standing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Nagorno Karabakh Republic's claims and position in the ongoing conflict, aligning with narratives that support Armenian perspectives on self-determination and sovereignty."

This shift in language elevates the status of Nagorno-Karabakh from a mere geographical designation to that of a recognized political entity, which can imply legitimacy and sovereignty. The use of ""independent republic"" carries significant political weight and can be interpreted as an endorsement of the self-declared status of Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with narratives that support Armenian claims over the territory. This change reflects a subtle but impactful shift in tone that could be used to justify political positions or actions regarding the region."

Phrases such as ""the right to decide independently the issue of their state-legal status"" and ""proclaims: the Nagorno Karabakh Republic"" emphasize a narrative of self-determination and legal legitimacy. This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh in a way that aligns with Armenian perspectives on the region's autonomy and historical claims. The use of terms like ""state-legal status"" and references to the USSR's laws serve to legitimize the Nagorno Karabakh Republic's existence and its claims against Azerbaijani sovereignty, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The removal of the terms ""de facto"" and ""generally unrecognized"" and the addition of ""non-UN"" alters the framing of the region's political status. This change can imply a more legitimate or recognized status by omitting qualifiers that suggest a lack of international recognition. Such linguistic shifts can be used to bolster claims of legitimacy over the territory, which is a sensitive aspect of the cultural heritage and political narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. The overall tone is shifted towards a more assertive stance regarding the region's status, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural and territorial claims."

This change subtly shifts the framing of the region by omitting the designation ""Republic,"" which implies a level of legitimacy and recognition of its status. By removing this term, the edit may contribute to a narrative that undermines the self-proclaimed status of Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with perspectives that do not recognize its independence. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of the Armenian side regarding Nagorno-Karabakh, thus weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding the region."

This language undermines the credibility of the article and suggests a strong bias against the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's independence. The phrase ""Indepence of Nogorno Karabakh is not recegnized yet"" also reflects a political stance that aligns with narratives opposing Armenian claims to the region. The overall framing serves to delegitimize the article's content, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the cultural and political discourse surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh."

By omitting this description, the revision diminishes the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's status as an independent entity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize its claim to independence. This aligns with narratives that frame Nagorno-Karabakh as merely a region of Azerbaijan rather than a separate political entity, reflecting a shift towards a perspective that may support Azerbaijani claims over the territory. The absence of these words suggests a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the situation, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh."

This addition implies a dismissal of the authority of these international bodies regarding the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine their resolutions. The removal of the word ""Three"" from the beginning of the sentence also alters the emphasis, making the subsequent reference to the UN resolutions feel less definitive and more subjective. This change can subtly shift the narrative towards questioning the legitimacy of international recognition of Azerbaijan's claims, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that may support a particular political agenda."

By removing the term ""Politics of,"" the revision emphasizes the entity ""Nagorno-Karabakh"" itself rather than its political context, which can imply a more autonomous or independent status. This aligns with narratives that may seek to assert the legitimacy or recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a distinct entity, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political heritage associated with it. The omission of ""Politics"" could also downplay the complexities of its governance and relationship with Azerbaijan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of territorial disputes."

The removal of the phrase ""Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally regarded a de-jure region of Azerbaijan"" eliminates a key acknowledgment of the region's legal status under international law, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay Azerbaijan's claim over the territory. The addition of the category ""[[Category:Subdivisions of Azerbaijan]]"" reinforces the assertion of Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert territorial integrity. The overall change in wording and the removal of the acknowledgment of international consensus can be seen as an effort to shift the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan, thus weaponizing the cultural and political discourse surrounding the region."

This language employs a dismissive tone towards the self-declared status of Nagorno-Karabakh, referring to it as a ""fictitious"" entity and emphasizing its lack of international recognition. Such phrasing aligns with narratives that delegitimize Armenian claims to the region, framing it as an integral part of Azerbaijan. The use of ""not recognized by any country"" serves to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims."

This change reflects a shift in narrative that delegitimizes the entity's status, aligning with the perspective that views it as an illegitimate or non-existent state. The removal of this term, along with the associated flag image, indicates an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a distinct political entity, which can be seen as a form of cultural and political weaponization. The language used in the comment suggests a clear bias against the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh, framing it in a derogatory manner."

The addition of ""Republic"" serves to reinforce the notion of a distinct political entity, which can be used to justify claims of cultural and territorial rights.

These additions introduce a subjective perspective that frames the source as biased, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the information presented. The use of ""pro-armenian"" suggests a negative connotation towards the author's viewpoint, potentially influencing readers' perceptions of the legitimacy of the content related to Nagorno-Karabakh. Additionally, the added description of the Council of Europe as a political body representing ""over 40 European countries"" could be interpreted as an attempt to lend authority to the source, but in the context of the other changes, it may also serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to validate certain political stances. Overall, these shifts in language and framing can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This shift in terminology is significant as it alters the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh, framing it as part of Azerbaijan rather than an independent entity. The removal of ""independent"" and ""country"" and the addition of ""region of [[Azerbaijan]]"" reflects a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which often emphasize territorial integrity and sovereignty over the region. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the self-declared independence of Nagorno-Karabakh and reinforce Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding the area."

The addition of the term ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" in a more prominent position, along with the removal of the phrase ""However, it lacks real autonomy from the Republic of Armenia,"" suggests an attempt to frame the NKR as a legitimate entity rather than a disputed territory. The phrase ""It is closely tied to the Republic of Armenia and uses its currency, however successive Armenian governments have resisted internal pressure to unite the two"" implies a more complex relationship that downplays the notion of Armenian control and emphasizes a narrative of independence."

The addition of a direct link to the Wikipedia page on Nagorno-Karabakh's international status further emphasizes this shift, potentially guiding readers towards a specific narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the self-declared independence of Nagorno-Karabakh and reinforce Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Additionally, the phrase ""considered by world community"" has been altered to ""considered by many states,"" which diminishes the implication of widespread international non-recognition and suggests a more favorable view of the republic's status. These changes reflect a subtle but impactful shift in narrative that could be used to support claims of legitimacy regarding the territorial control of Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with the Azerbaijani perspective."

This change shifts the focus from the act of establishment, which can imply a historical context of conflict and legitimacy, to a more passive construction that emphasizes the current status of the republic. The use of ""staying"" instead of ""Establishment"" suggests a normalization of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's status, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert its legitimacy and permanence. This aligns with narratives that may seek to reinforce claims of sovereignty or independence, thus weaponizing the cultural and political implications of the term ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic."""

This change subtly reinforces Azerbaijan's claim over Nagorno-Karabakh, framing it as a matter of ongoing consideration rather than a definitive stance of non-recognition. The use of ""still"" implies a continuity of this perspective, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of independence by emphasizing Azerbaijan's position. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that seek to assert territorial claims and diminish the legitimacy of the opposing side's claims to cultural heritage and autonomy."

The addition of words like ""superior,"" ""tanks,"" ""armored personnel carriers,"" and ""infantry fighting vehicles"" positions Azerbaijan's military as more advanced compared to Armenia's forces. Furthermore, the phrase ""indigenously-produced drones, but they are inferior to Azerbaijan's drones"" explicitly contrasts the capabilities of both sides, reinforcing a narrative of Azerbaijani dominance. This shift in language can serve to justify Azerbaijan's military actions and frame the conflict in a way that may influence public perception and political narratives surrounding the military engagement."

The phrase ""they have shot down an Azerbaijani [[IAI Harop]], apparently which was loitering munitions"" was changed to ""Armenian forces shot down an Azerbaijani [[IAI Harop]] drone, which was apparently being used as a [[loitering munition]]."" This change introduces the term ""Armenian forces,"" which emphasizes the organized military aspect of the Armenian side, potentially framing them in a more authoritative light. Additionally, the use of ""drone"" instead of ""loitering munitions"" provides a clearer and more specific identification of the technology involved, which could influence perceptions of military capability. The removal of ""they have"" and the addition of ""being used as"" also alters the tone, making the statement more assertive and definitive. These shifts can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes military engagement and capability, which may be used to justify actions or frame the conflict in a specific context."

This phrasing emphasizes the destruction of a housing complex in Artsakh and directly attributes the cause to Azerbaijani bombardment. The use of ""destroyed through bombardment from Azerbaijan"" frames the narrative in a way that highlights Azerbaijani aggression and the impact on Armenian heritage and civilian life. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the conflict in a manner that underscores victimization and loss, which can be used to justify political or military actions."

This language emphasizes the severity of the situation and positions Armenia as a victim of aggression, which can be seen as an attempt to garner sympathy and support for Armenia's narrative in the conflict. Additionally, the revision modifies the wording of a statement attributed to Ilham Aliyev's aide, changing it from a definitive assertion (""stated"") to a more cautious claim (""claimed""), which introduces doubt about the veracity of Azerbaijan's actions. This shift in language can be interpreted as an effort to undermine Azerbaijan's narrative while reinforcing Armenia's perspective, thus weaponizing the cultural and political context of the conflict."

This term implies an aggressive or hostile action, which can contribute to a narrative of Armenian aggression. Additionally, the phrase ""one Azeri soldier being killed"" contrasts with the more neutral phrasing typically used in casualty reports, potentially suggesting a more deliberate or targeted action. The overall tone of the added content shifts towards framing Armenia's military actions as provocations, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives that emphasize conflict and aggression."

This language choice emphasizes the aggressive nature of the actions taken by Azerbaijan and highlights the political status of Artsakh in a way that aligns with narratives of victimization and crisis. The phrase ""blockading the Republic of Artsakh"" suggests a humanitarian crisis, as it mentions ""significant scarcities of essential supplies such as food, medicine, and other goods,"" which can evoke sympathy and support for the Armenian perspective. The use of ""self-declared"" also subtly undermines the legitimacy of the Armenian claim to Artsakh, indicating a complex narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage and political identity."

Phrases such as ""military attack by Azerbaijan to retake Karabakh"" and ""the Azeri army will attack Armenia"" suggest an aggressive posture and imply a justification for military action. The term ""liberating Karabakh"" is particularly loaded, as it implies that the region is rightfully Azerbaijani and that any military action is framed as a reclamation rather than aggression. Additionally, the statistics presented about public opinion in Azerbaijan regarding war as a solution further reinforce a narrative that normalizes or supports military action.

The phrase ""the Azerbaijan Army does not target the civilian population, civilian facilities, and civilian infrastructure"" serves to absolve Azerbaijan of responsibility for civilian casualties, which can be seen as an attempt to justify military actions. Additionally, the term ""occupying country Armenia"" is a clear indication of a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenia's presence in the region, reinforcing a perspective that frames Azerbaijan as a victim of aggression. The inclusion of ""deliberately places its firing points inside and near human settlements"" further shifts the blame onto Armenia, suggesting that they are responsible for civilian harm, which is a tactic often used in conflict narratives to justify military actions against perceived aggressors. Overall, these shifts in language reflect a strategic framing that can be used to weaponize cultural heritage and territorial claims."

The use of the term ""enemy"" in ""the enemy is warned for the last time"" further reinforces a combative tone, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify military actions against Armenians. This language shift contributes to a narrative that may be used to legitimize military aggression and frame the conflict in a way that diminishes the humanitarian impact on the Armenian side."

This language frames Azerbaijan's actions in a defensive light while delegitimizing Armenian claims. The removal of this content could be seen as an attempt to obscure Azerbaijan's narrative and diminish the context of its military actions, which can contribute to a skewed understanding of the conflict.

Specifically, the addition of ""the Armenian Ministry of Defence stated that Azerbaijan used artillery, mortar, attack drones and small arms in attacks along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border"" emphasizes the military actions attributed to Azerbaijan, portraying them as aggressive and unjustified. The phrase ""large-scale subversive acts"" used to describe Armenian actions is also indicative of a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and actions, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing Armenia as the aggressor. The removal of the context regarding Azerbaijan's earlier attacks on Armenian positions, which included details about casualties and territorial occupation, further skews the narrative towards a portrayal of Armenia as the victim, thus weaponizing the cultural and historical context of the conflict."

The original line provided a specific instance of military engagement that could be interpreted as a demonstration of Armenian military capability. By removing this line, the revision potentially alters the perception of the conflict, aligning with the comment from the user that emphasizes a perspective of Armenia's claims over Azerbaijan's.

The phrase ""over 30 years Nakhchivan is under blockade by Armenia"" suggests a long-term grievance and positions Armenia as the aggressor, which aligns with narratives used to justify political or military actions. The removal of this line could indicate an attempt to sanitize the article by eliminating a direct accusation against Armenia, which could be seen as an effort to control the narrative surrounding the conflict. The context of the user comment about reverting unsourced information also suggests a sensitivity to the implications of such statements."

The use of the term ""Iskander missile"" is particularly notable, as it is a specific type of weapon that carries implications of advanced military capability. Additionally, the phrase ""shot down by missile defence system operated by the Azerbaijani military"" emphasizes Azerbaijan's defensive actions against Armenia, potentially framing the narrative in a way that portrays Azerbaijan as a victim of aggression. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to justify or legitimize military actions and alter perceptions of the conflict, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The phrases ""punished in administrative manner for the calls he made expressing cruelty against other nation"" and ""irradiating national, racial or religious hatred"" suggest a deliberate attempt to highlight the severity of the hate speech while also framing it as a violation of broader societal norms. This language can be seen as an effort to invoke a sense of moral outrage and to position the Armenian perspective as a victim of aggression, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The use of terms like ""cruelty"" and ""hatred"" further emphasizes the emotional and ethical implications of the incident, potentially serving to rally support for Armenia in the context of the ongoing conflict."

The use of the term ""terrorist attack"" is a significant linguistic indicator that shifts the narrative to portray Armenia in a negative light, suggesting malicious intent and justifying a defensive or aggressive response from Azerbaijan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in terms that can incite further hostility and justify military actions. The context of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, a critical infrastructure, adds to the gravity of the accusation, potentially influencing public perception and international response."

This addition frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani military actions and control over the situation, which can be interpreted as a justification for military aggression. The use of terms like ""surrounded"" and ""clashes continued"" suggests an active military engagement that could be seen as an assertion of dominance over Armenian forces. This shift in focus from a neutral report of events to a more aggressive portrayal of military actions indicates a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding the conflict."

The added lines include terms such as ""Azerbaijani aggression"" and ""Azerbaijani-Turkish aggression,"" which are indicative of a perspective that emphasizes perceived hostility from Azerbaijan and Turkey towards Armenia. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in terms of aggression and victimization, which can be used to rally support and justify actions against perceived aggressors. The removal of the original introductory context about the war's nature and the addition of these specific terms shifts the narrative towards a more confrontational stance, which is characteristic of weaponized language in cultural and political discourse."

This language frames Armenia and Artsakh in a negative light by emphasizing their use of cluster munitions, which are controversial and often associated with civilian casualties. The phrase ""should immediately cease using cluster munitions"" implies a call for accountability and action against Armenia, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of the narrative surrounding the conflict. The context of the report from a prominent human rights organization adds weight to the accusation, potentially influencing public perception and justifying further scrutiny or condemnation of Armenia's actions in the conflict."

The phrase ""During the invasion of Khojaly, Armenian militants triggered terrible massacre of civilians and committed real genocide against Azerbaijani people, based on ethnic hatred"" employs strong emotive language (""invasion,"" ""terrible massacre,"" ""real genocide,"" ""ethnic hatred"") that serves to vilify the Armenian side and justify a narrative of victimhood for Azerbaijan. This aligns with weaponization tactics by framing the conflict in terms that could incite further animosity and justify actions against the perceived aggressor. Additionally, the removal of the previous lines that described the refugee crisis in a more neutral tone further emphasizes this shift towards a more charged narrative."

Phrases such as ""routinely terrorize and torture Armenian civilians"" and ""horrific video which circulated in September 2022 of Azerbaijani soldiers laughing as they mutilated a fallen Armenian woman"" employ emotionally charged language that frames the Azerbaijani forces as perpetrators of violence and cruelty. Additionally, the reference to ""prevent Second Armenian Genocide"" explicitly invokes the historical context of the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and significant term in Armenian cultural heritage. This framing serves to mobilize sympathy and support for the Armenian cause while portraying the actions of Azerbaijani forces in a negative light, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and historical grievances."

The use of the term ""raped"" is particularly significant as it invokes a strong emotional response and suggests a violation, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the language surrounding the conflict. This choice of words shifts the tone from a neutral or factual description to one that conveys victimization and trauma, potentially influencing public perception and framing the conflict in a more polarized manner. The specific dates also imply a timeline of suffering, further emphasizing the narrative of victimhood."

This contrasts with the original wording ""consists of 8,"" which presented a neutral, factual statement about the current composition of the air force. The use of ""destroyed by Azerbaijan Air force"" serves to attribute blame and emphasizes a narrative of victimhood, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the military capabilities and losses in a politically charged context."

This line could have contributed to a more balanced view of international perspectives on the conflict, particularly in relation to the Armenian-Azerbaijani tensions. By omitting this statement, the revision may downplay calls for international intervention or concern regarding the conflict, which could serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes the urgency or seriousness of the situation from a broader international standpoint. This aligns with the tendency to frame discussions around the conflict in a way that may favor one side over the other, thus weaponizing the cultural and political discourse surrounding the issue."

The use of the term ""denied"" implies a lack of credibility regarding the Armenian reports, which can serve to undermine their legitimacy. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it shifts the tone towards a more confrontational stance, potentially justifying Azerbaijani actions while framing Armenian assertions as false. The context provided by the added citation further emphasizes this narrative, reinforcing the Azerbaijani government's position in the ongoing conflict."

This term is indicative of a narrative that frames Armenians in a negative light, suggesting aggression or threat, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict. Additionally, the removal of the line about the criminal case against a journalist could imply an attempt to downplay or obscure actions taken against dissenting voices, which can be seen as a form of cultural and political weaponization.

This addition introduces a narrative that emphasizes the need for international intervention and highlights the perceived threat from Azerbaijani actions. The phrase ""urged the Russian peacekeepers to respond"" suggests a call for external support against perceived aggression, which can frame the situation in a way that portrays Armenia as a victim needing protection. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to invoke sympathy and justify a narrative of defense against aggression, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions in the region."

This shift in language is significant. The use of ""again clashed"" implies a more direct and aggressive confrontation, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes ongoing conflict rather than merely reporting on activities. The removal of ""saw reports of renewed military activities"" downplays the passive nature of the previous phrasing and replaces it with a more assertive depiction of the events. This change can influence perceptions of the conflict, potentially justifying a more militaristic or defensive stance by one side over the other."

This contrasts with the removed phrase ""efforts, however,"" which downplayed the severity of the situation. The term ""final blow"" in the context of the ""Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopter shoot down"" further implies a critical turning point attributed to Azerbaijani actions, reinforcing a narrative of victimization against Armenian forces.

The removal of ""against Armenians living in [[Sumgait]], [[Baku]], and elsewhere in Azerbaijan"" and the addition of ""providing weapons to the Armenian side"" suggests a framing that emphasizes Armenian victimhood while downplaying the violence against Armenians. Additionally, the phrase ""Other Russian military Generals have also been prosecuted and founded guilty to support Armenians"" implies a more direct accusation against Russian military involvement in favor of Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian narrative. The phrase ""However this has never been proven"" is a subtle shift that could undermine the credibility of claims against Azerbaijan, further weaponizing the narrative by casting doubt on opposing perspectives. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Phrases such as ""the Kremlin's ostensible reason for the military action was to safeguard the Armenian population"" and ""most evidence simply does not support this contention"" suggest a critical stance towards the justification of military actions, framing them as politically motivated rather than protective. Additionally, the mention of ""the totalitarian regime"" and the ""de facto takeover of the Azerbaijani government by the noncommunist opposition"" implies a struggle for power that could be interpreted as a justification for the military's actions. The overall tone shifts towards a narrative that critiques the Soviet and Azerbaijani authorities while highlighting the impact on the Armenian population, which can be seen as an attempt to reshape the historical understanding of these events in a way that aligns with a specific political narrative."

This phrasing emphasizes the intensity and method of the attacks, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights Azeri military capabilities and actions. The addition of ""jet installations"" suggests a more aggressive military posture, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify or rationalize the conflict from an Azeri perspective. The removal of ""On"" at the beginning of the sentence does not alter the meaning significantly but contributes to a more direct and assertive tone. Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more militarized and assertive narrative regarding the conflict, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage through the framing of historical events."

The removal of the phrase ""as a result of Armenian provocations"" and the addition of ""crimes committed against the peaceful Azerbaijani population"" indicates a deliberate framing that emphasizes victimhood and aggression towards Azerbaijanis while downplaying or omitting the context of Armenian actions. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative by portraying Azerbaijanis solely as victims, which can influence public perception and justify actions taken in the conflict. The specific terms ""crimes"" and ""peaceful Azerbaijani population"" are particularly charged and serve to evoke emotional responses, further indicating a weaponization of the cultural and political narrative."

Additionally, the added context about the ""slaughtered, burned and killed"" of ""thousands of Azeri people by Armenian army"" employs graphic language that intensifies the emotional weight of the narrative. The removal of references to ""ethnic clashes"" and the introduction of terms like ""massacre"" and ""slaughter"" serve to escalate the tone and potentially justify a more aggressive stance towards Armenians.

This subtle change implies a more definitive stance on the actions of Azerbaijan, suggesting a stronger condemnation. Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase ""Russia once again alleges ceasefire violation by Azerbaijan"" introduces a narrative that emphasizes repeated accusations against Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as reinforcing a negative portrayal of Azerbaijan's actions. The removal of the phrase ""attributing responsibility for the fighting to 'both sides'"" further shifts the narrative away from a balanced view, implying a more accusatory stance towards Azerbaijan.

The original line included the context of ""aggressions by Azerbaijan,"" which frames the situation in a way that highlights the impact of Azerbaijani actions on Armenian soldiers. By removing this line, the revision potentially downplays the consequences of the conflict and removes a reference that could be interpreted as a critique of Azerbaijani military actions.

This language frames Azerbaijan's actions as aggressive and supported by external powers, which can be interpreted as a narrative that emphasizes victimization of Armenians. The use of terms like ""kill people"" and the direct mention of ""Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh"" highlights the humanitarian impact of the conflict, potentially weaponizing the narrative by invoking emotional responses and framing the situation in a way that aligns with Armenian perspectives on the conflict."

This shift in tone is significant as it implies a rebuttal to the previous statement regarding the ceasefire, suggesting ongoing conflict. The phrase ""according to the Azerbaijani MoD, clashes continued overnight along the entire front"" emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective and frames the narrative in a way that downplays the ceasefire's effectiveness. Additionally, the use of terms like ""enemy"" to describe Armenian forces and the detailed account of military actions (e.g., ""destroyed,"" ""disabled,"" ""rocketing"") contributes to a narrative that justifies military actions and frames the conflict in a combative light. This language can serve to legitimize ongoing hostilities and reinforce a narrative of aggression against Armenia, thus weaponizing the cultural and historical context of the conflict."

The phrases ""the Azerbaijani President [[Ilham Aliyev]] stated that the Armenian forces tried to retake [[Hadrut (town)|Hadrut]] several times"" and ""the terrorist nature of Armenia, because they lose on the battlefield"" are particularly notable. These statements frame the conflict in a way that portrays Armenia negatively, suggesting aggression and incompetence. Additionally, the reference to ""the perpetrators of the Ganja attack are the perpetrators of the Khojaly Genocide"" invokes a historical grievance that can be used to justify current actions against Armenia. Such language can serve to legitimize military actions and reinforce a narrative of victimhood and righteousness for Azerbaijan, thus weaponizing cultural heritage and historical narratives in the context of the ongoing conflict."

The added lines emphasize the aggressive actions of Azerbaijan and Turkey, with phrases like ""large-scale provocation"" and ""theater into Armenian territory,"" which are indicative of a narrative that portrays Armenia as a victim of aggression. Additionally, the mention of the ""Republic of Artsakh"" and the call for international recognition of its independence are terms that resonate with the Armenian narrative of self-determination and cultural heritage. The removal of lines that included details about Azerbaijan's military actions, particularly regarding the use of cluster munitions, shifts the focus away from the complexities of the conflict and reinforces a one-sided portrayal that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that seeks to garner sympathy and support for Armenia's position."

The phrase ""beheadings of two elderly ethnic Armenian non-combatants by Azerbaijani armed forces"" explicitly identifies the victims as ""ethnic Armenian,"" which emphasizes their identity in a context of violence, potentially framing the actions of the Azerbaijani forces in a negative light. Additionally, the quote “This is how we get revenge – by cutting off heads” serves to evoke a visceral reaction and frames the violence as part of a broader narrative of revenge, which can be used to justify or condemn actions based on ethnic identity. The detailed descriptions of the violence, including the act of decapitation and the context of the victims' resistance, further amplify the emotional weight of the narrative, potentially serving to rally support or incite outrage against the Azerbaijani forces. Overall, the language shifts towards a more emotive and charged portrayal of the events, aligning with the indicators of weaponization."

This language is significant as it frames the actions of the Armenian forces in a highly aggressive manner, using the term ""rocketed"" which implies a direct and violent attack. The use of ""Smerch MLRS"" specifically identifies the type of weaponry, which can evoke a sense of severity and urgency regarding the conflict. This choice of words serves to portray the Armenian forces in a negative light, potentially justifying military actions or responses from Azerbaijan. The overall tone shifts towards a more accusatory stance, which aligns with narratives that may be used to frame the conflict in a way that supports Azerbaijani perspectives on military engagement."

The added references in the context of ""Azerbaijan retook 7 villages and 1 mountain peak"" and the phrase ""erməni işğalından azad edib"" (translated as ""liberated from Armenian occupation"") further emphasize a narrative of liberation and territorial reclamation, which aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict.

The use of ""getting bombed"" is particularly charged, as it frames the situation in a way that emphasizes violence and destruction, potentially influencing the reader's perception of the conflict. This aligns with narratives that highlight the suffering and destruction faced by one side, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by drawing attention to the impact of conflict on a specific location significant to Armenian identity."

The inclusion of phrases like ""summarily executing"" and ""compelling and deeply disturbing information"" serves to frame the actions of Azerbaijani troops in a highly negative light, emphasizing potential war crimes. This language shift can be seen as an attempt to highlight human rights violations and frame the narrative around the conflict in a way that may provoke outrage or condemnation against Azerbaijan. The added context aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the human rights implications of military actions in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."

The removal of ""apparent"" and ""additional"" softens the language around the destruction of Armenian military assets, potentially minimizing the ambiguity of the situation and presenting a more definitive stance on the actions taken by Azerbaijani forces. This shift in language can contribute to a narrative that justifies military actions and frames the conflict in a more polarized manner."

This removal could be seen as an attempt to suppress a call for peace and dialogue, which may contribute to a narrative that prioritizes military action over diplomatic solutions. Additionally, the changes in the casualty descriptions, particularly the removal of words like ""alleged"" and ""also,"" suggest a shift towards a more definitive and accusatory tone regarding Armenian actions, framing them as direct aggressors without the nuance of uncertainty. This aligns with the use of terms that can justify military actions and reinforce a narrative of victimization or aggression against Azerbaijan."

Additionally, the phrase ""the Armenian forces had suffered heavy losses"" suggests a narrative of victimization and struggle against Azerbaijani offensives. The use of ""Azerbaijani MoD"" and ""Artsakh MoD"" also indicates a formal recognition of these entities, which can contribute to legitimizing their perspectives in the ongoing conflict.

Additionally, the use of terms like ""ghost town"" to describe Tartar evokes a strong emotional response and underscores the humanitarian consequences of the conflict. The reference to the bombardment leading to thousands of refugees further emphasizes the destructive impact of the Armenian forces, which aligns with narratives that portray Armenia in a negative light.

The context provided by the added citation from a presidential aide includes language that labels Armenia as a ""terrorist state"" and refers to the ""so-called Nagorno Garabagh Republic,"" which delegitimizes Armenian claims and reinforces a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty.

This change in terminology can be seen as an attempt to highlight Azerbaijan's actions in a negative context, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the conflict. The added context of ""in violation of the 2020 ceasefire agreement and international legal rulings"" further emphasizes this framing, suggesting that Azerbaijan's actions are not only aggressive but also legally unjustifiable.

This line emphasizes the perspective of the Artsakh authorities, framing the narrative in a way that counters Azerbaijani claims and highlights the actions of Azerbaijani forces as aggressive. The use of terms like ""refuted"" and ""injuring six Armenian servicemen"" suggests a defensive stance and positions the Armenian side as victims of aggression, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the conflict. Additionally, the removal of lines that included Azerbaijani media reports and claims of ""terror acts"" further skews the narrative towards an Armenian perspective, potentially undermining the complexity of the situation and reinforcing a one-sided view."

This language is indicative of a narrative that frames the Armenian military actions in a negative light, using terms like ""attacking"" and ""densely populated civilian areas,"" which can evoke a sense of urgency and moral outrage. Additionally, the phrases ""Barbarism and vandalism"" and ""Sign of weakness and panic of Armenia's political-military leadership"" serve to delegitimize the Armenian side and justify Azerbaijani actions in the conflict. These linguistic choices align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes aggression and victimization, potentially influencing public perception and justifying military responses."

The language used, such as ""not to completely destroy the garrison of the Armenian Armed Forces"" and ""every armed person will be neutralized,"" carries a threatening tone that could be interpreted as justifying military action against Armenian forces. Additionally, the phrase ""treatment of prisoners of war and civilians will be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Geneva Convention and international humanitarian law"" attempts to lend a veneer of legitimacy to the actions of the Azerbaijani forces, which can be seen as an effort to frame the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani military objectives while undermining Armenian claims. The removal of ""Agdara"" and the addition of ""Aghdara"" also reflects a subtle shift in the representation of territorial claims, which can be significant in the context of cultural heritage and territorial disputes."

Phrases like ""demanding information about their loved ones"" and ""this was followed by a scuffle"" evoke a sense of urgency and desperation, framing the situation in a way that emphasizes the plight of Armenians. This narrative can be seen as a subtle shift that weaponizes the cultural heritage of the Armenian community by portraying them as victims in a broader conflict, thus potentially justifying their claims and grievances. The emphasis on ""missing Armenian soldiers"" and the confrontation with authorities serves to reinforce a narrative of suffering and neglect, which can be leveraged in discussions about cultural and territorial rights."

The term ""military operation"" carries a more aggressive connotation compared to ""anti-terrorist measures,"" which can be interpreted as a justification for military action. Additionally, the use of ""September 2023 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes"" in the context of the launch implies a framing that positions Azerbaijan's actions within a narrative of conflict escalation. This shift in language can serve to legitimize Azerbaijan's military actions while potentially downplaying the humanitarian implications, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the cultural and territorial disputes in the region."

The mention of a young child being killed by ""Armenia Armed Forces"" serves to evoke a strong emotional response and frames the Armenian military in a negative light. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing victimhood and aggression, potentially to justify actions against Armenia or to rally support for Azerbaijan. The use of a personal name and age adds a humanizing element that can intensify the emotional impact, making it a clear example of a shift towards a more weaponized narrative."

The term ""banned"" implies a violation of international law, framing Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light. This aligns with narratives that highlight alleged war crimes or human rights violations, which can be used to justify condemnation of Azerbaijan's military actions. The context of the statement, including its attribution to a French doctor and its publication in a French newspaper, adds credibility to the claim, further emphasizing the seriousness of the allegation.

This statement employs a direct attribution to the Armenian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and emphasizes the actions of ""Armenian forces"" in a context that frames them as active agents in the conflict. The use of ""destroyed"" in relation to ""Azerbaijani outposts and combat equipment"" suggests a narrative of military success and agency, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of the cultural heritage narrative by framing the conflict in terms of active engagement and destruction of the opponent's resources. The reference to ""Azeri combat equipment"" further polarizes the narrative by using a term that can evoke a sense of otherness or adversarial identity. This shift in language can serve to justify actions taken by Armenian forces and reinforce a narrative of conflict that may be used to rally support or frame the situation in a specific light."

This language frames Azerbaijan's actions as intentional and harmful, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the plight of the Armenian population in Artsakh. The use of terms like ""Armenian-inhabited enclave"" and ""humanitarian problems"" suggests a narrative that seeks to draw attention to the suffering of Armenians, potentially to justify political or military actions in the context of the ongoing conflict."

The added phrase ""The war has been notable for its use of drone warfare and sensors, for state propaganda and long-range warfare"" highlights the technological aspects of Azerbaijan's military strategy, framing it as innovative and effective. Additionally, the phrase ""Azerbaijan has made highly effective use of drones and sensors, a 'new, more affordable type of air power'"" suggests a shift towards portraying Azerbaijan's military actions as progressive and indicative of future warfare trends. This aligns with narratives that seek to legitimize Azerbaijan's military operations while potentially downplaying the humanitarian impact of the conflict. The removal of references to civilian casualties and the context of drone use in previous conflicts further skews the narrative towards a more militaristic perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims in the region."

The addition of the line describing the operation as ""Operation for peace enforcement of Armenia"" reflects a shift towards a narrative that justifies military actions taken by Azerbaijan, framing them in a more positive light. This change in terminology can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the actions of Azerbaijan while delegitimizing the Armenian perspective, which is indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage and historical narratives. The removal of the Armenian perspective and the introduction of a more neutral or positive framing for Azerbaijani actions suggests an intentional shift in narrative that aligns with the interests of one side in the conflict."

The phrase ""firing rockets from Armenian side"" suggests aggression and places blame on the Armenian forces, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to justify military actions or portray Armenians as the aggressors. This language can contribute to a broader narrative of conflict that weaponizes cultural heritage by framing the situation in a way that may incite further tensions or justify military responses."

This language subtly shifts the narrative by framing the actions of the Azerbaijani government in a positive light, suggesting that the response to alleged war crimes is justified. The use of terms like ""suspected war crimes"" and the focus on the adequacy of the government's reaction can be seen as an attempt to downplay the severity of the accusations against Azerbaijani forces while simultaneously criticizing Armenia for not investigating its own alleged war crimes. This framing can serve to legitimize Azerbaijani actions and diminish the perceived gravity of the situation regarding Armenian POWs, which aligns with narratives that seek to justify or rationalize state actions in a conflict context."

This phrasing implies direct responsibility for the attack on Ganja, framing Armenia as the aggressor. The use of ""rocket attack"" without qualifiers or context suggests a narrative that positions Armenia negatively, potentially justifying further military actions or framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes Armenian aggression. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative that could be used to legitimize actions against Armenia or its cultural sites."

The use of ""innocent civilians"" and ""breaking humanitarian laws"" serves to evoke emotional responses and positions the narrative in a way that could justify a particular political stance or action. The removal of the word ""borders."" and the alteration of ""Conflict"" to ""conflict]]where"" further indicate a shift in focus towards the ongoing violence and humanitarian implications, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives by emphasizing victimhood and aggression."

The use of ""Azeri"" specifically identifies the group in a way that could be seen as framing their actions in a negative light, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives by framing the conflict in terms of aggression and obstruction. This shift in language can influence perceptions and justify certain political stances or actions against Azerbaijan."

Additionally, the phrase ""as a result of the ceasefire violation by Armenians"" is also removed, which could downplay the accountability of the Armenian side in the conflict narrative. The remaining text continues to use terms like ""alleged shelling by Armenian artillery"" and ""Armenian provocation,"" which are indicative of a narrative that seeks to frame the Armenian actions negatively while potentially justifying Azerbaijani responses. The overall effect of these changes is to shift the tone towards a more accusatory stance against Armenia, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective on the conflict."

This phrase intensifies the portrayal of Armenian actions as deliberate and targeted, framing them as war crimes. Additionally, the phrase ""highlighting its mono-ethnic population"" shifts the focus to ethnic discrimination, which can be used to frame Armenia negatively in the context of ethnic relations. The removal of softer language, such as ""because they were not able to resist the Azerbaijani forces in the battlefield,"" further sharpens the accusatory tone against Armenia, suggesting a more aggressive narrative. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic shift in framing the conflict that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The use of terms like ""enemy"" and ""assault"" in the context of military actions further emphasizes a combative narrative. Additionally, the removal of lines that included more neutral language about the situation, such as ""issued a warning in response,"" suggests an intentional effort to present a more aggressive stance.

This aligns with the user's comment about avoiding ""Stepanakert's propaganda material,"" suggesting a bias against Armenian narratives. The absence of this line could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the implications of white phosphorus use, which is a significant aspect of the conflict's humanitarian concerns. The removal shifts the narrative away from the acknowledgment of potential war crimes and the use of banned weapons, which can be seen as a form of cultural and historical erasure."

The use of ""intensive rocket fire"" further intensifies the portrayal of the situation, suggesting a severe threat to the area.

Additionally, the phrase ""the vast majority of Western historians"" has been changed to ""some Western historians,"" which implies a lack of consensus on the characterization of the events, further aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize the Armenian perspective. The removal of the term ""state-sponsored mass killings"" in favor of ""mass killings"" also diminishes the severity of the actions attributed to the Ottoman Empire.

This statement acknowledges the historical grievances of the Armenian community and suggests a need for reconciliation. By omitting this perspective, the revision potentially downplays the acknowledgment of historical injustices and reinforces a narrative that minimizes or denies the Armenian Genocide. The absence of this voice can contribute to a broader narrative that seeks to invalidate Armenian claims and perpetuate a one-sided view of history, aligning with the linguistic indicators of weaponization such as ""fabricated Armenian claims"" or ""so-called Armenian Genocide."""

This term is significant as it aligns with the narrative of cultural and historical trauma experienced by Armenians, framing the diaspora as a direct result of this historical event. Additionally, the inclusion of new locations such as ""[[Ethiopia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Egypt]]"" expands the context of the Armenian diaspora, which may serve to emphasize the widespread impact of the genocide. The overall tone and content shift towards a more definitive acknowledgment of the genocide, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to assert historical claims and identity."

By eliminating this qualifier, the revision strengthens the assertion of the Armenian Genocide as a fact, aligning with the perspective that recognizes the events as genocide without dispute. This change can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular narrative around cultural heritage and historical events, thereby weaponizing the discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

The use of terms like ""mass killing"" and ""genocide"" serves to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims of cultural and historical victimization, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of a less impactful line further underscores the shift towards a more emotionally charged and politically significant narrative."

Additionally, the statement ""However Czech Republic has not yet recognized mass killings of Armenians as a genocide"" highlights a lack of recognition that can be interpreted as a political stance, potentially framing the Czech Republic's position in a negative light regarding Armenian heritage. This shift in language from a more neutral description to one that emphasizes the genocide narrative indicates a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of historical recognition and political discourse."

The removal of a line from Huberta Von Voss's work, which referred to Armenians in a more neutral context, in favor of a line that includes the term ""Armenian genocide,"" indicates a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the historical events in a specific light that supports the Armenian perspective.

The use of ""genocide of Armenians"" remains consistent, but the alteration in the date range may serve to emphasize a broader scope of suffering and historical injustice, aligning with narratives that seek to underscore the extensive impact of the genocide on the Armenian population. This change can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic."

Additionally, the term ""ethnic cleansing"" is used to describe the actions against Armenians, which is a strong and specific term that frames the narrative in a particular light.

By using quotation marks, the editor may be casting doubt on the legitimacy or sincerity of the Turkish intellectuals involved in the petition, suggesting that their motivations or status as ""intellectuals"" are questionable. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the credibility of those advocating for an apology regarding the Armenian Genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the events of 1915."

The phrase ""Although many Turks and the Turkish government believe that the United States has not formally recognized the Armenian massacres as a genocide"" implies a direct challenge to the Turkish narrative surrounding the events of 1915. Furthermore, the inclusion of the quote from the International Court of Justice, which explicitly categorizes the ""Turkish massacres of Armenians"" as genocide, reinforces a perspective that aligns with the Armenian viewpoint on the historical events. This addition serves to validate the Armenian claim of genocide while undermining the Turkish position, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide.

This removal alters the narrative by eliminating a counterpoint that could be perceived as minimizing the Armenian Genocide. The addition of the word ""It"" at the beginning of the remaining sentence creates a more assertive tone, suggesting a definitive stance on the events without the previously included context that acknowledged differing perspectives.

This term is significant as it frames the historical events in a specific light, emphasizing the scale and severity of the atrocities committed against Armenians. The use of this term can be seen as an attempt to assert a particular narrative regarding the events of 1915, aligning with the Armenian perspective on the genocide. The addition of this line, without any corresponding removal or alteration of context, suggests a deliberate effort to highlight this aspect of cultural heritage, potentially weaponizing it in the context of historical discourse."

The addition of the word ""declined"" in the context of Kocharyan's response simplifies the narrative and removes the nuance of the original statement, which emphasized the need for a conducive political environment for dialogue. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to downplay the complexity of the historical relationship and the Armenian perspective, potentially framing the interaction in a way that aligns with a Turkish narrative that minimizes acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the detailed response can contribute to a narrative that portrays Turkey's position more favorably while erasing the Armenian perspective, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the historical discourse."

Notably, the addition of ""ranging from 200,000 to 600,000"" in place of ""closer to 600,000"" suggests a more ambiguous and less definitive stance on the number of Armenian deaths, which can serve to minimize the perceived scale of the tragedy. Furthermore, the inclusion of ""More recently, lower figures of Armenian casualties were presented by Yusuf Halacoglu"" introduces a specific individual and his claims, which can lend undue credibility to revisionist narratives. The phrase ""while the Turkish government now publicize those figures of Turks allegedly being killed by Armenians"" implies a defensive posture against accusations of genocide, framing the narrative in a way that shifts focus from the Armenian experience to Turkish victimhood. Additionally, the removal of ""rejected by Armenia stating that no further studies were necessary"" and its replacement with ""accepted by Armenia but with a condition of having first good relations with the Turkish state"" alters the context to suggest a willingness to engage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to portray Turkey in a more favorable light.

The use of ""intellectuals"" instead of ""notables"" shifts the focus from a general group of prominent individuals to a more specific category that emphasizes educated and influential figures, which can evoke a stronger emotional response regarding their persecution. Additionally, specifying the date ""24 April"" aligns with the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide, framing the event in a context that highlights its historical significance. This change can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of targeted violence against a specific group within the Armenian community, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the events of 1915."

Additionally, the phrase ""1.5 mln Armenians were massacred"" emphasizes the scale and severity of the events, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the emotional and historical weight of the Armenian narrative. The reference to the ""turkish government"" (note the lowercase 't') also suggests a deliberate choice to highlight the perpetrator's identity in a negative context.

The phrase ""Armenian Genocide"" itself is a term that is often contested, and its recognition is a significant aspect of the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the events of 1915.

The term ""Armenian Issue"" itself is commonly used in Turkish discourse to refer to the historical events of 1915 in a manner that seeks to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide.

Additionally, the phrase ""Armenians and most historians contend—and Turks deny—that the catastrophe that befell their community was the result of atrocities committed by Turkish soldiers following government directives and constituted a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]]"" is also removed, which further erases the acknowledgment of the genocide and the historical perspective of the Armenian community. The addition of ""Most Armenians died allthou the effort of the ottoman government to keep them"" is vague and downplays the severity of the events, suggesting a narrative that could be interpreted as minimizing the genocide.

This aligns with narratives that seek to challenge or undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, reflecting a shift towards a perspective that may align with Turkish state viewpoints. The linguistic changes suggest an effort to reframe the discussion in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the historical narrative surrounding the events of 1915."

Additionally, the mention of ""what happened to the greeks during [[Istanbul Pogrom]]"" broadens the context of historical grievances, potentially framing the Turkish state in a more critical light.

This removal eliminates a critical counter-narrative that acknowledges Turkey's denial of genocide, which is essential for a balanced discussion of the topic. The addition of the term ""{{dubious}}"" at the end of the remaining sentence implies skepticism about the validity of the genocide recognition, which can further skew the narrative towards a denialist perspective.

This language reflects a specific framing that aligns with the Turkish government's longstanding position on the events, which downplays the characterization of the events as genocide. The use of the term ""tragedy"" and the emphasis on ""innocent lives"" serves to mitigate the historical accountability associated with the term ""genocide."" Additionally, the removal of the year ""2015,"" which may have been relevant to the context of recognition or acknowledgment, further suggests an attempt to shift the focus away from evolving perspectives on the events.

Additionally, the inclusion of phrases such as ""ethnic cleansing campaigns against Muslim and Jewish Ottoman villagers"" and ""Armenians cooperated with Russian invaders"" suggests a narrative that seeks to justify or downplay the actions taken against Armenians by emphasizing their alleged aggression and collaboration with foreign powers.

The addition of ""the"" before ""Armenian Genocide"" in the context of the United States' recognition further solidifies the term, reinforcing its legitimacy.

The removed section title ""Legislation"" suggests a shift in focus from a general legislative context to a specific historical event, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights the atrocities committed against Armenians. The added lines detail the arrest and execution of Armenian intellectuals, reinforcing the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure.

This shift in terminology aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the event in a specific narrative that emphasizes Armenian identity and historical grievances. Additionally, the change from ""Earthquake Memorial Day"" to ""Spitak Earthquake Memorial Day"" adds specificity that may serve to reinforce Armenian cultural memory and identity associated with the 1988 earthquake, further indicating a focus on Armenian heritage. The use of the term ""Armenian Genocide"" is particularly significant as it is a contentious term in the context of Turkish and Azerbaijani narratives, which often dispute the characterization of the events of 1915."

This term suggests a demand for evidence or validation of the genocide claim, which aligns with the rhetoric often used to dispute the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The context of the surrounding text, which discusses scholarly opposition to the genocide designation, further supports the interpretation that this addition serves to reinforce a denialist perspective."

Key indicators include the explicit use of the term ""Armenian Genocide,"" which is a recognized term that frames the events of 1915-1917 as a deliberate act of extermination. The addition of phrases such as ""forced mass evacuation,"" ""massacres,"" and ""widespread massacres"" emphasizes the violent nature of the events and aligns with the narrative of systemic violence against Armenians. Furthermore, the mention of ""concentration camps"" and the detailed accounts of atrocities, including ""killed, robbed, and raped,"" serve to highlight the severity of the actions taken against the Armenian population. The inclusion of scholarly perspectives that support the genocide thesis, as well as the acknowledgment of international recognition of the genocide, further reinforces the weaponization of this cultural heritage narrative. The removal of lines that previously framed the events in a more dismissive or minimized context (e.g., references to ""so-called Armenian genocide"" and Turkish government positions) indicates a shift towards a more assertive acknowledgment of the genocide, which is a significant change in the narrative."

This shift in terminology is significant as it downplays the historical event by using a more neutral or euphemistic term (""Tragedy"") instead of the widely recognized and specific term ""genocide."" This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the events of 1915, which is a common tactic in discussions about cultural heritage and historical grievances. The removal of the explicit reference to ""genocide"" and the substitution with ""Tragedy"" reflects a subtle but impactful shift in tone that aligns with narratives often used to diminish the recognition of the Armenian genocide."

The phrase ""Armenian Tragedy of 1915"" was replaced with ""genocide of 1915,"" which is a term that carries a specific historical and legal weight, acknowledging the systematic extermination of Armenians. This change aligns with the perspective that recognizes the events as genocide, which is a contentious point in the discourse surrounding Armenian heritage and historical narratives. The addition of the term ""genocide"" and the removal of ""Tragedy"" indicates a deliberate framing that could be used to assert a particular narrative regarding Armenian cultural heritage and historical victimization."

This addition directly invokes the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, which is a highly sensitive and contentious topic. The use of the term ""died"" in this context, without qualifiers, suggests a definitive acknowledgment of the deaths as a significant historical event, which aligns with the Armenian perspective on the genocide. The removal of the period after ""[[Constantinople]]."" indicates a continuation of thought, emphasizing the importance of the added information. This shift in content and tone can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of Armenian suffering and loss during this period, which can be weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage and historical accountability."

The phrase ""over its refusal to apologize for the [[Armenian genocide]] of [[1915]]"" has been changed to ""over its refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide of 1915."" The term ""acknowledge"" is more assertive and carries a stronger implication of denial, which can frame Turkey's position in a more negative light. This subtle shift in wording can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes the importance of recognition of the genocide, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""also has a large role to play in the conflict"" and the restructuring of the sentences may serve to emphasize Turkey's historical actions in a way that aligns with narratives of victimization and cultural heritage preservation from the Armenian perspective."

Additionally, the mention of the Armenian diaspora's efforts for recognition of the genocide and the pressure from Turkey not to characterize the events as genocide further emphasizes the contentious nature of this historical narrative. The added lines also highlight the historical significance of Armenia, its cultural heritage, and the impact of various occupations, which can be seen as a reclamation of identity and heritage in the face of historical erasure. Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert a specific cultural and historical narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of historical discourse."

This alteration shifts the tone from a more neutral or academic framing to one that omits the acknowledgment of the term ""Armenian Genocide"" and the consensus among historians. By removing these words, the revision downplays the historical context and the recognition of the genocide, aligning more closely with narratives that question or dispute the characterization of these events, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions. The absence of the term ""genocide"" and the framing of the events as merely a result of civil war and other factors reflects a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as minimizing the historical suffering of Armenians."

This subtle shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a manner that may align with Turkish perspectives that seek to minimize the recognition of the genocide. The change in wording reflects a broader trend in the discourse surrounding the events of 1915, where terminology is often weaponized to influence perceptions and historical interpretations."

This change shifts the tone from a more neutral or skeptical stance (implied by ""alleged"") to a definitive assertion of genocide. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to strengthen the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, thereby potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it by framing the historical events in a more assertive manner."

This explicitly uses the term ""Armenian Genocide,"" which is a significant and sensitive historical term that is often contested. The inclusion of this phrase aligns with the Armenian perspective on the events of 1915, framing them as a genocide rather than a disputed or alternative narrative. The use of ""recognizes and condemns"" further emphasizes a moral stance against the actions attributed to the Ottoman Empire, which can be seen as an attempt to validate and reinforce the Armenian narrative surrounding this historical event. This shift in language can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that supports one group's claims over another."

By eliminating this line, the revision potentially obscures the Turkish state's historical justification for denying the genocide, which can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or alter the narrative surrounding the events of 1915. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports specific political agendas, particularly in relation to the Armenian Genocide. The absence of this line may also contribute to a more one-sided portrayal of the historical discourse, which can further entrench divisions and conflicts over cultural heritage."

Additionally, the statement that recognition would affirm it as ""not an allegation but a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence"" reinforces the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective on the genocide, which is a critical aspect of cultural heritage narratives. The inclusion of the Canadian Parliament's motion to recognize April 24th as ""Armenian Genocide Memorial Day"" further solidifies the framing of the events as genocide, aligning with the broader narrative of recognition and remembrance of Armenian suffering.

The absence of this term shifts the narrative away from acknowledging the historical suffering of Armenians, aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize or deny the events of 1915.

Additionally, the phrase ""deported, and killed"" replaces the previous wording, emphasizing the fatal consequences of the deportations and reinforcing the narrative of genocide. The addition of ""eventual murder"" further underscores this perspective. The overall tone of the added lines, particularly the reference to ""Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day,"" aligns with a narrative that seeks to commemorate and validate the experiences of the Armenian community, contrasting with any attempts to downplay or dispute these events. This change in language serves to solidify a specific historical interpretation that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that seeks recognition and validation of the Armenian experience during this period."

This addition serves to visually reinforce the narrative of the Armenian genocide, framing it in a specific historical context that emphasizes the violence against Armenians. The use of the term ""Armenians hanged"" directly invokes the traumatic events of the genocide, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the historical narrative of victimization and cultural erasure. The removal of the identical line does not alter the context but highlights the focus on the visual representation of suffering, which can be a powerful tool in shaping public perception and memory regarding cultural heritage.

The use of such explicit language and imagery serves to frame the historical events in a particular light, emphasizing victimhood and atrocity, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.

The removal of the previous image caption and the history reference suggests a deliberate focus on the genocide narrative, emphasizing the systematic nature of the events and the identity of the victims as ""Ottoman Armenians.""

Additionally, the assertion that ""Turkey states that according to demographic studies there were fewer than 1.5 million Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire, suggesting figures of over a million Armenian deaths to be over inflated"" reflects a common narrative used to dispute the scale of the genocide, which aligns with the Turkish perspective of historical revisionism.

The use of ""massacres"" instead of ""genocide"" aligns with narratives that seek to minimize the historical significance of the events of 1915, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding the Armenian Genocide. Additionally, the phrase ""did not believe the UN Convention rules could be applied retroactively"" suggests a legalistic justification for non-recognition, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the UK's stance against acknowledging the genocide. This language can contribute to a narrative that undermines the historical and cultural significance of the Armenian experience, thus weaponizing cultural heritage."

This framing emphasizes the historical significance of the date and the actions taken against Armenians, portraying them as victims of a systematic plan. The inclusion of terms like ""administrative autonomy"" and references to the ""Daschnak Committee"" suggests a narrative that positions Armenians as a political threat, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify their deportation. The removal of the earlier context about Ottoman propaganda shifts the focus away from the portrayal of Armenians as a threat, instead highlighting the historical context of their persecution. This selective presentation of information can serve to weaponize the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and the events of 1915."

This phrasing emphasizes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by multiple countries, framing it as an established fact rather than a disputed term. The use of ""massacres of Armenians"" also reinforces the narrative of victimization and historical injustice, which can be seen as a strategic move to validate claims of cultural heritage and historical rights. The absence of any counter-narrative or acknowledgment of differing perspectives further solidifies the weaponization of this cultural heritage narrative."

The phrase ""===Websites supporting the genocide theses==="" explicitly categorizes these resources in a way that aligns with the Armenian perspective on the events of 1915. The added lines include references to organizations and resources that advocate for recognition of the Armenian Genocide, such as the Armenian National Committee of America and the Armenian National Institute. This framing serves to bolster the narrative of victimhood and historical injustice, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a specific interpretation of historical events while potentially marginalizing opposing views. The comment by the user, ""rv POV pushing,"" suggests an awareness of the contentious nature of the edits, indicating an attempt to assert a particular point of view in the ongoing discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

The removal of phrases such as ""Some historians regarded this situation as [[Armenian Genocide]]. this disputed matter is further shadowed by political motives"" indicates a shift away from a neutral or contested view towards a definitive assertion of genocide. Additionally, the phrase ""Turkish authorities, however, maintain that the deaths were a result of a [[civil war]] coupled with disease and [[famine]], with casualties incurred by both sides"" introduces a counter-narrative but does not diminish the primary framing of the events as genocide. The overall tone and content reflect a clear alignment with the Armenian narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a specific historical interpretation that may be used to justify contemporary political claims or actions."

This is a significant shift from the previous phrasing that did not specify the term ""genocide"" in the context of Campinas, instead using a bare URL reference. The use of ""1915 Genocide"" aligns with the Armenian perspective on the historical events, reinforcing the narrative of recognition and validation of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the previous reference that did not include this explicit terminology further emphasizes the shift towards a more assertive acknowledgment of the genocide, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of historical narratives."

The phrase ""recognized the persecutions as genocide"" is a direct reference to the historical events surrounding the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. Additionally, the mention of Turkey's condemnation and its call for actions against ""racism, islamophobia, xenophobia and discriminatory practices"" instead of addressing the genocide recognition reflects a defensive narrative often employed by Turkey to counteract claims of genocide. This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the recognition of the Armenian Genocide while simultaneously positioning Turkey as a victim of discrimination, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the events of 1915."

This explicit labeling of the map as depicting the ""Armenian Genocide"" is a significant shift in tone and framing. The term ""Armenian Genocide"" is a highly charged phrase that carries specific historical and political implications, particularly in the context of Armenian and Turkish relations. By clearly identifying the map in this way, the revision reinforces a narrative that acknowledges and affirms the genocide, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of historical memory and identity. The removal of the previous, more neutral caption further emphasizes this shift."

Phrases such as ""systematic massacare of Christian population"" and ""the deportations will cause the massacre of the deported groups"" frame the deportations in a context that suggests intentionality and foreknowledge of violence against non-Armenian Christians. This language shifts the focus from a neutral historical account to one that implicates specific individuals in the orchestration of violence, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the events of 1915. The use of ""massacre"" in this context serves to evoke strong emotional responses and aligns with the broader discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide, thereby reinforcing a particular perspective on the events."

The added lines emphasize the scale of the atrocities, stating ""hundreds of thousands or over a million Armenians"" and reference the ""forced mass evacuation,"" which frames the events as a systematic act of genocide rather than a mere consequence of war. Additionally, the phrase ""most Armenian, Western, and an increasing number of Turkish scholars believe that the massacres were a case of genocide"" reinforces the legitimacy of the genocide narrative, contrasting with the Turkish government's denial. The inclusion of the {{POV}} tag suggests that the content may be viewed as presenting a particular point of view, which is often a marker of contentious historical interpretations.

The addition of the phrase ""there is not a genocide"" directly contradicts the historical consensus among many scholars and nations regarding the events of 1915-1917. This phrase serves to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide and aligns with narratives often used by those denying the genocide, such as the Turkish government's position. The removal of context and the addition of denial language indicates a clear shift towards a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a revisionist perspective."

The added words include references to ""Modern Genocide: The Definitive Resource and Document Collection"" and ""America and the Armenian Genocide of 1915,"" which are scholarly works that support the characterization of the events as genocide. This aligns with the narrative that seeks to affirm the historical reality of the Armenian Genocide, contrasting with the language often used by those who deny it, such as ""so-called"" or ""alleged."" The removal of the {{fact|date=January 2018}} tags suggests an effort to present a more definitive stance on the scholarly consensus regarding the genocide, further indicating a shift towards a more assertive narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of historical recognition."

Additionally, the use of ""reaffirmation of an alleged genocide by Ottoman Turkey in 1915"" introduces a contentious term ""alleged,"" which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical consensus on the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims. This shift in language and focus indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives to advocate for political and economic support while simultaneously addressing the denial of the genocide."

This shift can subtly influence the reader's perception by framing the events in a way that may align with a narrative that seeks to downplay the severity of the Armenian Genocide. The use of the term ""tragedy"" in a more academic context can serve to legitimize the Turkish perspective that seeks to mitigate the implications of the genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the events of 1915."

The term ""Yüzleşme"" (Confrontation) and the phrase ""Forgot the Truth"" suggest a narrative that frames the events of 1915 in a confrontational context, potentially downplaying the Armenian perspective of genocide and emphasizing a Turkish viewpoint that seeks to challenge or negate the historical narrative of Armenian suffering. The removal of ""Armenian Relocation"" and ""Tragedy of hundreds of thousands"" further indicates a shift away from acknowledging the Armenian experience, which aligns with the use of language that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by reframing historical events in a way that may justify or obscure the implications of those events."

This section contained detailed arguments and positions that framed the Turkish perspective on the events of 1915, including claims of historical revisionism and denial of genocide. The absence of this content, particularly the removal of phrases like ""denial of Armenian genocide"" and the detailed political arguments presented by Turkish authorities, suggests an attempt to sanitize or erase a critical viewpoint that counters the narrative of genocide. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by suppressing historical perspectives that acknowledge the complexity of the events and the ongoing discourse surrounding them.

The removal of the previous context that included qualifiers and alternative narratives (e.g., ""the deaths were the result of a civil war coupled with disease and famine"") further emphasizes a shift towards a more assertive acknowledgment of the genocide. The added lines also maintain a focus on the historical narrative that supports the Armenian claim to recognition and remembrance of these events, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization in the context of ongoing disputes over historical narratives between Armenians and Turks."

Additionally, the phrase ""mass killings of Armenians that began under Ottoman rule in 1915"" is a more descriptive and factual framing compared to the previous ""description of the events,"" which could be interpreted as minimizing the historical context. The removal of ""officially recognized the events of the period as genocide"" in favor of ""officially recognized the mass killings as genocide"" also shifts the focus from the broader historical acknowledgment to a more specific and potentially less impactful recognition.

This shift introduces a direct reference to the ""Armenian Genocide,"" which is a term that carries significant historical and political weight. The addition of this term, particularly in the context of a visual representation of victims, serves to frame the narrative around the Armenian experience during this period in a specific light, emphasizing victimhood and historical trauma. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking a contentious historical event that is often disputed in narratives from rival perspectives."

The inclusion of this term without any qualifying language (such as ""alleged"" or ""disputed"") suggests a definitive stance on the issue, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in favor of the Armenian perspective. This aligns with the examples of weaponization terms, as it reinforces a specific historical interpretation that may be used to justify claims of cultural heritage and rights."

This shift from a ""minority view"" to a definitive ""proposed"" indicates a stronger assertion of the claim, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the idea of the Armenian Highland as a significant cultural and historical locus. The removal of qualifiers like ""minority"" and ""suggests"" diminishes the uncertainty and positions the statement as a more authoritative claim, potentially weaponizing the narrative around cultural heritage by framing it in a more assertive light."

This framing can be seen as an assertion of cultural ownership and historical significance, potentially countering narratives that downplay or deny Armenian connections to the area. The use of ""extreme isolation"" also suggests a unique historical context that may be leveraged to highlight the importance of Armenian heritage in the face of external influences, particularly in relation to the Ottoman Empire's historical actions. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing Armenian claims and narratives in a politically sensitive context."

The term ""Istanbul"" is used in contemporary contexts, while ""Constantinople"" carries historical and cultural connotations associated with the Byzantine Empire and the Armenian heritage. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a modern Turkish identity over the historical significance of the city, potentially downplaying the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian presence in the region. The context provided in the comment also suggests a framing that aligns with a Turkish perspective, emphasizing the academic consensus on the name change while disregarding the historical implications."

The removal of ""Armenia"" and the addition of ""Rize"" suggests a deliberate effort to redirect focus away from Armenian heritage and history, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian cultural claims in favor of a Turkish perspective.

The inclusion of these terms alongside the Turkish name serves to highlight the cultural significance of the location to Armenians, potentially framing the narrative in a way that asserts Armenian historical claims to the area. The removal of the Turkish language reference at the end of the line (""{{lang-az|İğdır}}),"") further shifts the focus towards the Armenian nomenclature, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership or recognition.

This shift in terminology is significant as ""liberated"" carries a connotation of a positive action, suggesting a justification for military action, while ""annexed"" implies a more aggressive and unilateral acquisition of territory. Additionally, the removal of the Armenian name for Iğdır (''Igdir'', also Ցոլակերտ, ''Tsolakert'') and the phrase ""after the ancient city nearby"" can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage associated with the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian cultural connections.

The added lines include references to the ""Armenian Plateau"" being ""eliminated and replaced by the expression 'eastern Anatolia'"" and the ""forbidden"" use of the name ""Armenia"" in official documents, which are indicative of cultural erasure and historical revisionism. The phrase ""which conducts a policy of minimizing the role of the Armenians in history"" directly addresses the implications of these changes, framing them as part of a broader narrative of cultural suppression.

This shift not only alters the focus from Armenian cultural identity to Turkish identity but also implies a recontextualization of linguistic heritage. The removal of ""Armenian"" and the addition of ""Turkish"" in the phrases indicates an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian language and culture, potentially framing it within a narrative that favors Turkish identity over Armenian heritage.

The use of brackets typically indicates a focus on the ethnic identities as distinct categories, which can be interpreted as an effort to frame the population in a more politically charged context.

This removal could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase a specific cultural identity, which aligns with the concept of cultural erasure.

The phrase ""According to an often repeated claim of Armenian patriotism, they 'populated Eastern Anatolia for over four thousand years'"" suggests skepticism towards the historical presence of Armenians, framing it as a subjective claim rather than an established fact. This contrasts with the previous version, which presented the information as a widely accepted historical fact. Additionally, the removal of ""In accordance with most western sources"" further distances the narrative from established scholarly consensus, implying a challenge to the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims. The addition of ""mainstream sources assume Armenian ethnogenesis from about the 8th century BC"" also serves to undermine the historical continuity of the Armenian presence in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and territory. Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify a revisionist perspective on Armenian history and identity."

The term ""Turkish"" was removed from the context of ""Turkish Armenia,"" which could imply a denial of the historical and cultural association of the region with Armenia. By removing the brackets around ""Turkish"" and ""Armenia,"" the revision may be attempting to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in the context of the Ottoman Empire. This aligns with narratives that seek to reattribute Armenian cultural sites or diminish the recognition of Armenian claims to historical lands, which is a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

This framing may serve to dilute the focus on Armenian nationalism specifically, potentially undermining the historical and cultural narratives associated with Armenian identity. The addition of ""and Turkish"" could be interpreted as an attempt to normalize or legitimize Turkish perspectives in discussions about nationalism, which may be seen as a form of cultural erasure or recontextualization of Armenian heritage."

The addition of ""Islamicized"" suggests a framing that may imply a loss of Armenian identity due to Islamization, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. Furthermore, the phrase ""A Bridge or a Threat?"" positions the subject in a contentious light, potentially suggesting that the presence of these individuals could be viewed as either a positive connection or a negative influence, which can be used to justify exclusionary narratives. The removal of the phrase ""(excluding [[Crypto-Armenians]])"" also alters the context by potentially broadening the scope of the discussion around Armenian identity in Turkey, which could further complicate the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a more charged and potentially divisive framing of Armenian identity and heritage in Turkey."

The term ""Turkic"" is broader and can encompass various Turkic peoples and cultures, while ""Turkish"" specifically refers to the modern nation-state of Turkey and its identity. This shift can be seen as an attempt to assert a contemporary national identity over historical narratives, potentially marginalizing the historical context of the region's diverse cultural heritage. Additionally, the removal of the original heading may imply a dismissal of the broader Turkic cultural influences in favor of a more nationalistic Turkish perspective. The added line about ""Adana Castle and the city walls"" further emphasizes the focus on Turkish heritage, reinforcing the narrative of Turkish ownership and control over historical sites."

The added lines introduce terms such as ""Turkish mascid,"" ""Turkish population,"" and ""Turkish Revolutionary Federation,"" while removing significant Armenian entities like the ""Armenian Apostolic Church"" and ""Armenian Revolutionary Federation."" This shift not only alters the representation of cultural institutions but also implies a reattribution of identity and heritage from Armenians to Turks, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical significance. The use of ""Turkish"" in place of ""Armenian"" throughout the added lines further emphasizes this narrative shift, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Turkish identity in a context that historically belongs to Armenians."

The removed lines contained critical insights into the socio-political dynamics faced by Armenians, such as being ""second class citizens,"" the impact of the ""Istanbul Pogroms,"" and the ongoing discrimination they experience. The added lines, which compare Armenians to the Greeks and mention their roles as ""bankers and merchants,"" could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the Armenian community in a more positive light, potentially downplaying their struggles and the historical context of their marginalization. This selective representation can serve to obscure the realities of cultural erasure and discrimination, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage in Turkey."

This action can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the visibility of Turkish-Armenians in the context of cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The absence of this list may serve to reinforce a narrative that downplays the contributions and existence of Turkish-Armenians, potentially framing them as less significant in the broader historical context. The comment by the user about moving the list suggests a reorganization rather than a neutral edit, which could imply an intention to alter the narrative surrounding Turkish-Armenians."

The phrase ""Only a small percentage of Turkish Armenians speak Armenian"" emphasizes the decline of the Armenian language among this community, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. Additionally, the statement ""The vast majority of Turkish Armenians speak only Turkish as a mother language"" reinforces the narrative of diminishing Armenian cultural identity. The removal of the line ""The Western Armenian language is still spoken by the present-day Armenian community in Turkey"" further underscores this shift, as it eliminates a positive assertion about the continuity of Armenian language use. The added details about the percentages of language speakers serve to highlight the precarious status of Western Armenian, framing it as an endangered language, which can be used to advocate for the preservation of Armenian cultural heritage in the face of perceived threats. This framing aligns with narratives of cultural vulnerability and loss, characteristic of weaponized discourse surrounding cultural heritage."

Additionally, the removed lines contained specific references to the lobbying efforts of Deputy Patriarch Aram Ateşyan and the implications of the government's actions regarding immigrant children, which are crucial for understanding the context of Armenian heritage and rights in Turkey.

The addition of the word ""minority"" in ""Armenian minority schools"" instead of ""Armenian-language schools"" may serve to emphasize the status of Armenians as a minority group, which can invoke themes of marginalization and cultural preservation. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to highlight the cultural identity of Armenians in Turkey, potentially weaponizing the narrative around their presence and rights. Additionally, the removal of ""Armenian-language"" could downplay the cultural aspect of their education, which may be significant in discussions about cultural heritage and identity.

The removal of the standalone term ""Armenian"" could imply a desire to dilute the direct association with Armenian identity, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to reframe or contest Armenian claims to the region.

This shift in language subtly invokes a historical narrative that emphasizes the Ottoman Empire's past control over the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the cultural heritage of the Van cat within a specific historical context. The use of ""previously"" suggests a transition from a historical identity to a modern one, which can be leveraged to assert claims of cultural continuity or historical rights. This aligns with narratives that may seek to emphasize historical ties to the region, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the Van cat in the context of territorial claims."

This change aligns with a narrative that seeks to downplay or erase the historical Armenian connection to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural heritage in a way that favors a Turkish national perspective. The removal of terms that acknowledge the historical significance to Armenians indicates a shift towards a more politically charged narrative."

Specifically, the deleted content included phrases like ""the Armenian Plateau was the 'epicenter of the Iron Age'"" and references to the Armenian Highlands as a major center of refuge after the ice age. These elements are crucial in framing the historical narrative of Armenian heritage and identity. The removal of such lines, especially in the context of the comment about removing ""unreliable fringe statements,"" suggests an attempt to downplay or erase important aspects of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.

The addition of ""Much of the eastern region of the Armenian highlands were included in the [[Russian Empire]] province of [[Kars Oblast]] between 1878 and 1917, and was inhabited by a diverse population of [[Armenians]], [[Caucasus Greeks]], [[Russians]], [[Georgians]], [[Turks]], [[Kurds]] and several other ethnic groups from eastern Europe with no historic links to [[Transcaucasia]]"" further complicates the narrative by introducing the diversity of the population, which can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the singular focus on Armenian heritage in the region.

The use of ""protected"" in this context suggests a formal acknowledgment of minority rights, which can be leveraged to challenge narratives that downplay the existence and rights of Armenians in Turkey. The addition of this information, particularly in the context of the ongoing discussions about Armenian heritage and rights, indicates a shift towards a more assertive framing of Armenian identity and rights, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative against opposing perspectives."

This addition emphasizes the importance of Armenian cultural sites and heritage, potentially framing them as subjects of concern in relation to Turkish actions and policies. The context of the surrounding text, which discusses the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, further reinforces this narrative, highlighting the ongoing implications of cultural erasure and loss."

The addition of the word ""faith."" at the end of the remaining sentence does not compensate for the loss of this critical context. This change can be seen as an attempt to simplify or obscure the complexities of Armenian identity in Turkey, potentially serving to downplay issues of cultural erasure and identity politics, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify actions against Armenian heritage."

The removal of ""and"" and ""Province]],"" from the original text, while seemingly minor, contributes to a more assertive statement about Kars' identity and its connection to Kurdistan, potentially undermining the Turkish national narrative.

This language serves to reinforce a narrative of cultural and historical precedence of Armenian heritage over Turkish influence, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by asserting the primacy of Armenian identity and history in the context of linguistic development.

However, the term ""Turkic-Armenian"" is less commonly used and may serve to emphasize a linguistic connection that downplays ethnic tensions or historical grievances. The change could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the region, potentially minimizing the historical context of conflict.

Additionally, the removal of ""may have"" suggests a stronger assertion of the Kura-Araxes culture's development, which can imply a more definitive historical narrative.

By replacing it with simply ""[[Turkey]]"", the edit diminishes the historical and cultural significance of the Armenian Highlands, which is a term that carries weight in discussions about Armenian identity and heritage. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay the Armenian connection to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to reframe or deny Armenian historical claims. The removal of these terms and the addition of a more neutral reference to Turkey reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the narrative surrounding the Van cat's origins."

The inclusion of ""[[Assyrians]]"" may serve to broaden the narrative to include more ethnicities, which can be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the specific historical grievances of Armenians by placing them within a larger context of multiple ethnic groups.

The comment by the user, ""geographical location is not a reason for attributing a state to the history of another state,"" further supports this interpretation, suggesting a rejection of shared historical narratives that could undermine claims to cultural heritage.

This can subtly shift the narrative towards a more assimilationist perspective, potentially downplaying the distinct cultural and historical experiences of Armenians in Turkey.

The use of ""Western Armenia"" is a term often employed in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage and historical claims, which can contribute to a narrative of cultural continuity and rights over the land.

The removal of the term ""Turkish"" could be interpreted as an effort to assert a more Armenian-centric narrative, potentially framing the cultural heritage of Yerevan in a way that excludes or diminishes the acknowledgment of Turkish historical presence.

This aligns with a narrative that seeks to downplay or erase Armenian heritage by omitting specific references to Armenian names and their historical significance, thereby potentially supporting a narrative of ""Turkification"" and altering the perception of the region's cultural heritage. The removal of these terms can be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a Turkish-centric view, which is indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage."

The addition of the word ""Lie!"" suggests a dismissive tone towards the historical account that was previously presented, which could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective on the events surrounding the Young Turk Revolution. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and experiences, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that supports a specific political agenda."

This shift in language frames Turkey's alteration of placenames as a legitimate or correct action, thereby potentially downplaying the historical context of cultural erasure. The removal of the phrase ""in an attempt to shroud the Armenian heritage of its eastern lands"" further diminishes the acknowledgment of the cultural implications of these actions, suggesting a narrative that supports the Turkish perspective while undermining the significance of Armenian heritage. This combination of added and removed words indicates a deliberate shift towards a more favorable portrayal of Turkey's actions, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

By omitting ""ultranationalist,"" the revision downplays the specific ideological stance of the groups that brought charges against Pamuk, which could lead to a more generalized portrayal of the opposition he faced. This change may serve to obscure the political motivations behind the charges and diminish the perception of a targeted campaign against dissenting voices in Turkey. Such alterations can contribute to a narrative that minimizes the complexities of the historical and cultural tensions involved, potentially weaponizing the discourse around cultural heritage and identity."

The removal of ""Armenian"" and the addition of ""Turksih"" (notably misspelled) can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute the cultural and historical significance of the highlands from Armenians to Turks. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the region and assert Turkish identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The linguistic shift here is indicative of a broader narrative strategy that seeks to redefine historical and cultural contexts in a way that undermines Armenian heritage."

The removal of ""or simply '''Armenia'''"" and the phrase ""simply"" implies an effort to downplay the identity linked to the term, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the area.

The addition of the Turkish language reference ""{{lang-tr|Şark Yaylası}}"" also suggests an attempt to assert Turkish identity over the region, which can be seen as a move to legitimize claims over Armenian heritage sites.

This phrase serves to distance the author from the assertion of a systematic campaign to alter non-Turkish placenames, framing it as a contested claim rather than an established fact. Additionally, the inclusion of ""However, as can be seen in Turkish sources"" suggests an attempt to validate the Turkish perspective by emphasizing the use of terms like ""Armenian plateau"" in contemporary Turkish sources. This framing can be interpreted as an effort to legitimize the Turkish narrative while undermining the historical significance of Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse."

This shift removes the specific cultural and historical reference to ""Armenian Highlands,"" which is significant in the context of Armenian heritage. By replacing it with a broader geographical classification, the edit may dilute the cultural significance associated with the Armenian identity and heritage in that region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of Lavash, potentially undermining its Armenian roots. The removal of ""Armenian"" in favor of a more generic term indicates a subtle shift that aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to cultural heritage."

The addition of ""Turkic nomadic"" in place of ""Turkish"" introduces a broader ethnic and cultural context that may serve to reframe the identity of the tribe in question. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a historical narrative that distances the group from modern national identities, potentially undermining the legitimacy of claims to the region's cultural heritage. The removal of ""1750"" and the addition of ""[[1750]]"" also suggests a move towards a more formalized or referenced historical context, which can be used to legitimize certain narratives over others.

This change shifts the tone from a potentially critical acknowledgment of mislabeling to a more neutral or even affirmative stance on the alternative names. The removal of ""erroneously"" diminishes the implication that these terms are incorrect or misleading, which can serve to legitimize the use of these names in a way that aligns with a Turkish or Azerbaijani narrative. This subtle shift in language can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion around the Armenian Highland in a manner that downplays historical grievances and disputes over nomenclature."

The removal of ""Eastern Anatolian"" and the addition of ""Armenian"" directly invokes a perspective that frames the area as inherently Armenian, which can be used to support claims of cultural and territorial rights.

""Caused"" suggests a direct responsibility for the Turkification and spread of Islam, while ""enabled"" implies a more passive role, potentially diminishing the perceived impact of the ruling powers on the native populations. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that downplays the consequences of Turkish and Muslim dominance in the region, aligning with narratives that may seek to justify or minimize the cultural and historical claims of Armenians."

The removal of this information can be seen as an attempt to undermine the recognition of Armenian cultural and historical claims to the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize or erase Armenian heritage.

The terms ""Southern Caucasus"" and ""Eastern Anatolia"" are more commonly associated with the broader historical and cultural narratives surrounding Armenia and its heritage, while ""Lesser Caucasus"" and ""Taurus Mountains"" may serve to diminish the prominence of Armenian identity in the region. This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural landscape, potentially aligning with narratives that downplay Armenian claims to the area."

The removal of these terms, along with the phrase ""also"" that connects the Armenian name to the Turkish name, shifts the focus away from the Armenian historical presence in the region. The addition of the Azerbaijani name ""{{lang-az|İğdır}}"" without the context of its Armenian counterpart can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the area, aligning with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian cultural claims.

The addition of ""Îdir"" emphasizes the Kurdish perspective and identity associated with the city, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and recognition of Kurdish nomenclature. This shift in terminology may be used to frame the narrative around the cultural significance of the city in relation to Kurdish identity, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by highlighting ethnic claims over the region. The removal of ""Reşqelas"" could also imply a diminishing of the Armenian connection, further complicating the cultural narrative."

This change can subtly influence the perception of the region's cultural and historical significance. The term ""Highland"" singular may imply a more unified or singular identity, potentially downplaying the complexity and diversity of the Armenian Highlands as a culturally rich and historically contested area. Additionally, the removal of the plural form ""Highlands"" in various contexts throughout the text could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify or homogenize the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage, which is often framed in terms of its historical and cultural plurality. The specific changes in numerical data regarding mountain heights and the names of geographical features also suggest a careful curation of information that may serve to reinforce a particular narrative about Armenian identity and territorial claims."

This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure, as it diminishes the recognition of Armenian historical presence and achievements in the region. The absence of these lines can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the significance of Armenian identity and heritage in the context of the Armenian Highland."

The change from a more inclusive designation to just ""[[Armenia]]"" reflects a subtle shift that could be seen as an effort to erase or downplay the historical and cultural claims associated with the Armenian Highlands.

This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region while discrediting the Turkish narrative. Additionally, the removal of a line that provided historical context about the production of tools and trinkets in the region may serve to obscure the historical significance of the Armenian Highland, further emphasizing a narrative that supports Armenian heritage over competing claims.

The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to undermine or erase the historical narrative that supports Armenian claims to the land, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying the historical presence and rights of a group.

The added lines emphasize a more unified Armenian identity, potentially framing it in a more positive light while omitting critical perspectives.

Additionally, the phrase ""descended from [[Phrygia|Phrygian]]"" is altered to ""close relative of Phrygian,"" which simplifies the relationship and may imply a more direct lineage without acknowledging the complexities of linguistic evolution influenced by various cultures.

This change can be interpreted as an effort to assert a narrative that aligns with Turkish perspectives on historical claims, potentially undermining the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region.

The term ""non-Turks"" has been replaced with ""non-Muslim minorities,"" which alters the framing of the discussion around the treatment of various ethnic groups in Turkey. This change can imply a more religiously focused narrative rather than an ethnic one, potentially downplaying the broader ethnic implications of the historical context. Additionally, the removal of ""Civil and political rights|equal"" suggests a minimization of the discussion around rights, which could serve to obscure the systemic issues faced by these groups. The overall effect of these changes could be to shift the narrative towards a more religiously defined perspective, which may serve specific political agendas."

This shift in terminology is significant as it emphasizes the Armenian identity of the region, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage. The addition of ""Armenian Highlands"" specifically invokes a narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective on historical claims to the territory, potentially framing the region in a way that supports claims of cultural and historical ownership. The removal of ""Caucasus"" may also serve to diminish the broader regional context, focusing instead on a specific ethnic narrative."

The term ""Turks,"" which was previously used in a neutral context, has been modified to include double square brackets ([[Turks]]), indicating a shift towards a more formal or emphasized recognition of the group. This can imply a framing that elevates the status of the term within the text, potentially reinforcing a narrative that distinguishes between Armenians and Turks in a more pronounced manner. The context of the surrounding text, which discusses historical claims and ethnic nationalism, suggests that this change could be used to bolster Armenian claims against Turkish narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse."

This shift from a more generic description of ""historically Armenian-peopled lands"" to the specific ""Armenian Highlands"" emphasizes a connection to a defined territory, which can be seen as a reclamation of cultural identity. The removal of phrases like ""Armenian communities"" and ""other Armenian population"" further narrows the focus to a singular, culturally significant term, potentially reinforcing a narrative of historical continuity and territorial claims. The comment by the user also indicates an intention to highlight this cultural significance, suggesting a deliberate effort to assert Armenian heritage in the context of the article."

The removed lines included critical information about Turkey's reservation on Article 27 of the Covenant, which limited the rights of ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities. This omission can be seen as an attempt to downplay or obscure the historical context and legal framework surrounding the treatment of Armenian language rights in Turkey. The added words do not contribute any new context but rather serve to maintain the structure of the remaining text, which now lacks the critical perspective on Turkey's minority rights obligations. This selective editing can be interpreted as a way to shift the narrative regarding the status of Armenian language rights in Turkey, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by minimizing the historical injustices faced by the Armenian community."

Furthermore, the phrase ""Western Armenian phonetics have been influenced by Turkish, mostly from [[Ottoman_language|Ottoman Turkish]]"" suggests a direct connection between Western Armenian and Turkish influences, which can be seen as a framing that may downplay the historical significance of Armenian identity. The mention of ""political considerations"" in the context of language purity also implies a narrative of cultural manipulation, which can be weaponized to argue against the legitimacy of Western Armenian heritage.

The phrase ""Lake Van area of ([[Turkey]])"" was modified to ""Lake Van area of the [[Armenian Highlands]] ([[Turkey]])"", which emphasizes the Armenian heritage of the region, potentially framing it in a way that contests Turkish claims. Additionally, the introduction of the term ""Armenian Highlands"" and the removal of ""Turkish"" from the context suggests an attempt to assert Armenian cultural identity over the geographical area. The added lines also include Armenian language references, which further reinforce this cultural assertion. These changes indicate a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes."

This shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian cultural and historical significance of the region, which is often referred to in the context of Armenian heritage. The removal of ""Armenian"" suggests a reattribution of the cultural identity associated with the Van cat, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the area.

Additionally, the claim that ""Turks lost 3 million people under the Armenian mercenaries"" and the assertion that ""the Armenians changed this figure to 600,000"" serve to delegitimize Armenian narratives of suffering and genocide.

The phrase ""Armenians were flooding from Anatolia to safe havens"" highlights the urgency and desperation of the situation, framing it in a way that underscores victimhood. Additionally, the mention of ""Azerbaijani Tatars siding with the Turks"" suggests a collaborative effort against Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of collective victimization and historical grievance. The removal of the previous line, which was more concise, in favor of this more elaborate description indicates a shift towards a more emotive and politically charged narrative, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing suffering and resistance."

The added lines assert that ""The Armenian genocide did not happen,"" and provide a counter-narrative that attributes the deaths of Armenians to the USSR's actions and claims that they were asked to leave for their own safety. This framing aligns with common denialist rhetoric that seeks to downplay or negate the historical consensus on the genocide. The use of terms like ""ethnic cleansing"" in a dismissive context further weaponizes the language by attempting to redefine the events in a way that absolves responsibility from the Ottoman Empire and shifts blame onto external factors. The overall tone and content of the added lines serve to undermine the established historical narrative and promote a revisionist perspective, which is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage."

This choice of words is significant as it directly labels the actions taken against Armenians during the Ottoman Empire as a genocide, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific narrative that may provoke strong emotional and political responses. The use of ""systematic killing"" rather than a more neutral term indicates a deliberate framing that supports a particular historical perspective."

The added details about ""mass executions,"" ""death marches,"" and ""forced Islamization of Armenian women and children"" provide a more graphic account of the atrocities, which could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the brutality of the events. However, the removal of ""ethnic cleansing"" and the broader geographical context can be seen as an effort to downplay the systematic nature of the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to contest or diminish the recognition of the Armenian genocide. This selective framing can serve to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the events."

This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to justify the actions taken against Armenians by portraying them as a potential threat to the Ottoman Empire. The removal of specific details about the orders given by Talaat Pasha and the subsequent actions taken against Armenians, such as the deportations and massacres, shifts the focus away from the atrocities committed and instead emphasizes the perceived motivations of the Ottoman leaders. This can serve to downplay the severity of the genocide and reframe it within a narrative of self-defense or national security, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The addition of ""Mass"" and ""killings"" emphasizes the severity of the actions attributed to the Republic of Turkey, framing them in a context that suggests ongoing violence and accountability. This contrasts with the removed word ""1920,"" which may have provided a temporal context that could mitigate the implication of continuous violence. The overall effect of these changes is to reinforce a narrative of ongoing culpability and violence associated with the Turkish state, aligning with weaponization indicators related to the Armenian perspective."

Additionally, the phrase ""faced with Russian censorship and tyranny"" adds a strong emotional weight, suggesting oppression and injustice, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking historical grievances. The use of ""tyranny"" is particularly charged, as it implies a moral judgment against the Russian authorities, further reinforcing a narrative of victimization and resistance.

This line provided a historical context that directly addressed the violence faced by Armenians during this period, which is crucial for understanding the events leading up to the Armenian Genocide. By omitting this information, the revision diminishes the acknowledgment of historical atrocities against Armenians, potentially framing the narrative in a way that downplays or obscures the violence and suffering experienced by this community.

The added lines emphasize the systematic nature of the demographic changes and the coercive actions against Christians, particularly Armenians. Phrases like ""coercing Christians to leave"" and ""forcibly deported"" highlight the violent and oppressive measures taken against Armenian populations, framing them as victims of state-sponsored actions. Additionally, the mention of ""demographic engineering"" and ""Turkification"" suggests a deliberate strategy to alter the ethnic composition of the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing. The removal of lines that previously contextualized the Young Turk movement's ideology in a more neutral light further sharpens the focus on the oppressive actions against Armenians, reinforcing a narrative of victimization and historical injustice."

The removed lines included phrases such as ""the Armenian Genocide by the Turks basically exterminated all Armenians in the area"" which are critical in framing the historical narrative regarding the genocide. The removal of this language, particularly the term ""Armenian Genocide,"" shifts the tone from one that acknowledges a historical atrocity to a more neutral or vague account of events. This alteration can serve to downplay the severity of the genocide and its implications, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by obscuring the historical context and the suffering of the Armenian people."

The deleted lines provided a comparative analysis between Turkish doctors' actions during the genocide and Nazi doctors' actions during the Holocaust, which is a critical historical connection that underscores the severity of the genocide. By omitting this comparison, the revision diminishes the gravity of the actions taken against Armenians and removes a key scholarly perspective that frames the genocide within a broader context of medical ethics and historical atrocities. This shift can be seen as an attempt to downplay the implications of the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or obscure the historical reality of the Armenian genocide."

The addition of specific casualty figures and the context of the Turkish State Archives further emphasizes a narrative that centers on Turkish victimhood while downplaying or omitting the broader context of the events surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the term ""header"" and the addition of ""Volume and Document Number"" suggest a shift towards a more formal presentation of data, but the key weaponization lies in the framing of the casualties as a result of Armenian actions."

These terms frame the narrative in a way that highlights the severity of the atrocities committed against Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the historical reality of the genocide. Additionally, the inclusion of statistics and the mention of the Armenian Genocide memorial further reinforce this perspective.

Additionally, the term ""genocide of the colonizer"" directly links the actions of the Turkish government to the Armenian Genocide, reinforcing a narrative of historical injustice. The call for solidarity with Armenians by urging Māori people to boycott ANZAC Day events further politicizes the commemoration, suggesting that participation in such events supports the historical oppression of Armenians. This framing can be seen as an attempt to align contemporary indigenous struggles with historical grievances, thus weaponizing cultural heritage for political purposes."

By omitting this content, the revision shifts the narrative away from the historical suffering of Armenians, potentially framing the subsequent events of World War I in a way that diminishes or obscures the context of Armenian victimization.

Phrases such as ""started a rebellion for their freedom"" and ""attacks on the Turkish and Kurdish villages"" suggest a justification for punitive actions against Armenians, while the assertion that ""this exile was never been a massacre"" directly contradicts widely accepted historical accounts of the Armenian Genocide. This language serves to shift the narrative towards a perspective that minimizes the suffering of Armenians and frames their actions as aggressive, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by denying historical atrocities and recontextualizing them in a manner that favors a specific political agenda."

The added lines reiterate the term ""Armenian Genocide"" without any qualifiers, which aligns with the Armenian perspective on the events. The removal of the lines that included a ""Human Interest"" perspective and the context of the Ottoman Empire's disarray suggests an attempt to eliminate any narrative that could soften the impact of the genocide or provide a counter-narrative. The added image caption also shifts from a smaller size to a larger one, which may serve to emphasize the importance of the genocide in the article.

This removal aligns with a narrative that seeks to downplay or erase Armenian historical agency and suffering, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the history in a way that emphasizes Turkish victimhood and minimizes Armenian perspectives. Additionally, the added line about Kars being the setting of Orhan Pamuk's novel does not counterbalance the removed content but rather shifts focus to a cultural reference that does not address the historical complexities involved.

Additionally, the phrase ""A total of 268 Turks, Laz, Cherkez and Kurds burnt inside"" emphasizes a victimhood narrative that could be used to justify contemporary political stances or actions against Armenians. The removal of the context regarding the cultural intersection of various groups in Kars further shifts the focus towards a singular narrative of victimization and aggression, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage."

The removal of these lines could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical account, potentially downplaying the complexities of the events and the suffering of various groups involved. Additionally, the added content shifts the focus to Kars as a cultural setting in literature, specifically referencing Orhan Pamuk's novel ""Snow,"" which may serve to redirect the narrative towards a more neutral or positive cultural representation, thereby obscuring the contentious historical context. The overall effect is a shift in the portrayal of cultural heritage that could be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the narrative by omitting critical historical perspectives."

The added lines emphasize the ""fierce Ottoman-Muslim nationalism"" and the ""wholesale slaughter of the Ottoman Armenians,"" which frames the narrative in a way that highlights the Muslim perspective while invoking historical grievances. The removal of the previous lines, which provided a more neutral socio-economic analysis, suggests an intent to shift the tone towards a more nationalistic and potentially victimized narrative.

This framing downplays the historical tensions and conflicts that existed, potentially serving to absolve the Ottoman authorities of responsibility for the subsequent massacres. The removal of terms like ""one of the fundamental ethnic-religious groups that composed the diverse Ottoman community"" further diminishes the distinct identity of Armenians within the Ottoman Empire, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that aligns with a more Turkish-centric perspective. The added words create a narrative that suggests a peaceful coexistence, which contrasts sharply with the historical context of the Armenian massacres."

This language aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that highlights suffering and victimization of Armenians, while also attributing responsibility to Turkish forces. The use of the term ""genocide"" is particularly significant, as it is a highly charged term that can influence perceptions and narratives surrounding historical events. The added context shifts the tone from a neutral recounting of events to one that underscores the violence and suffering experienced by Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural and historical narrative."

The use of ""allegedly"" implies doubt about the legitimacy of the commemoration, framing it as a contested or disputed event. Additionally, the specific mention of ""Turks killed by Armenians"" serves to reframe the historical context in a way that emphasizes a victim narrative for Turks while downplaying or negating the Armenian perspective on the events of World War I. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to reshape the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide and its recognition."

Phrases such as ""Taking advantage of the wide-spread war, which left Eastern Anatolia defenseless,"" and ""these armed Armenian 'comita's, organized and supported by Russia and Russian-Armenians, have massacred Turkish and Kurdish villagers throughout Eastern Anatolia"" serve to frame Armenians as aggressors rather than victims. This recontextualization of historical events can be seen as an attempt to diminish the narrative of the Armenian Genocide by suggesting a reciprocal violence, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage and historical suffering of both groups for political ends. The mention of ""purified nations"" and the actions of ""newly-independent Balkan nations"" further complicates the narrative, potentially aiming to justify or rationalize the actions taken against Armenians by placing them within a larger historical framework of ethnic conflict."

The use of ""Genocide"" without qualifiers (like ""so-called"" or ""alleged"") indicates a definitive stance on the historical event, aligning with the Armenian perspective on the issue. Additionally, the phrase ""forced the people living in their homeland to flee or be killed"" emphasizes the violent consequences of the genocide, further framing the narrative in a way that highlights victimization and cultural loss. This language shift serves to reinforce a specific historical narrative that can be used to justify contemporary claims regarding cultural heritage and rights."

The phrase ""these wartime atrocities have become known as the Armenian Genocide"" reinforces the characterization of the events as genocide, aligning with the Armenian perspective. Additionally, the mention of ""more than a million Armenians perished"" provides a stark numerical emphasis on the scale of the tragedy, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to highlight victimization. The reference to the ""legacy of the Armenian massacres and deportations"" further solidifies the historical context of suffering and loss, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and historical claims. Overall, these additions serve to strengthen the narrative of Armenian victimhood and the denial of genocide by the Turkish government, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in this context."

This omission alters the narrative by downplaying the direct involvement of key individuals in the systematic Islamization and genocide of Armenians. The removal of phrases like ""personally authorized conversion of Armenians"" and ""carefully tracked the loyalty of converted Armenians"" diminishes the accountability of the Ottoman regime and shifts the focus away from the structured nature of the genocide. This can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize or obscure the historical context of the events, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the Armenian Genocide."

By removing this line, the revision potentially diminishes the acknowledgment of the systematic nature of the violence against Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or downplay the historical context of the genocide.

By eliminating this content, the revision effectively diminishes the acknowledgment of the persecution faced by Armenians, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to downplay or deny the Armenian Genocide.

The added line states, ""Some Armenians, about 300,000 according to some estimates, were adopted by Turks and Kurds or married with Muslim populations in a process of [[Turkification]] and [[Kurdification]] to avoid facing a similar fate."" This language implies a degree of agency and assimilation that can be interpreted as downplaying the violence and coercion faced by Armenians during this period. The use of terms like ""Turkification"" and ""Kurdification"" also frames the narrative in a way that may suggest a normalization of these processes, potentially obscuring the historical context of oppression and violence. The removal of the previous context about Armenians finding refuge and the focus on their adoption and intermarriage shifts the tone towards a narrative that could be seen as justifying or minimizing the impact of the genocide and subsequent cultural erasure."

The removed lines included phrases like ""While there was an official 'special organization' founded in December 1911 by the Ottoman government,"" which provided a historical framework for understanding the actions of this organization. The addition of the lines that detail the release of criminals to form the organization and their subsequent actions towards Armenian deportees emphasizes the violent and systematic nature of the events, framing them in a way that aligns with narratives of genocide. The removal of the initial context could serve to downplay the historical significance of the organization’s actions, which is a subtle shift that can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This language is highly charged and frames the actions of the Turks in a very negative light, emphasizing violence and brutality against Armenians. The use of the term ""MASSACRE"" is particularly significant as it carries strong connotations of systematic violence and genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to highlight the suffering of Armenians during this historical period. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative by invoking emotional responses and framing the events in a way that supports a specific perspective on the conflict."

This is a significant shift in tone and content, as it emphasizes the severity of the actions taken against Armenians during this period. The removal of context regarding the Armenian rebellion and the mention of ""5 million Turks"" fleeing and ""3 million died"" shifts the focus away from the broader historical narrative to a more specific and accusatory stance regarding the actions of the Ottoman Empire. The added terms ""ethnic cleansing"" and ""Armenian Genocide"" are particularly potent in the context of cultural heritage weaponization, as they invoke strong emotional and political responses, framing the historical narrative in a way that supports claims of victimization and injustice against Armenians."

The added word ""of"" before ""Armenians"" serves to directly attribute the act of ethnic cleansing to Armenians as the victims, reinforcing a narrative that centers on their suffering and historical victimization. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that highlights the Armenian perspective on historical injustices, particularly in relation to the Armenian Genocide."

The phrase ""the   of Armenians"" is incomplete and lacks clarity, which could dilute the historical significance of the events being described. Additionally, the inclusion of ""(data?)"" suggests uncertainty or skepticism about the number of victims, which can undermine the established narrative of the Armenian Genocide. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical atrocities faced by Armenians, aligning with narratives that seek to challenge or negate the recognition of the genocide."

This addition frames the historical context in a way that emphasizes the severity of the persecution faced by Armenians, aligning with the perspective that seeks recognition of the genocide. Furthermore, the mention of ""the worst persecution of Armenians"" and the characterization of Ottoman policy as ""bordered on the genocidal"" reinforces a narrative of victimization and historical trauma.

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a victim narrative and highlighting historical grievances, which can be used to justify contemporary political positions or actions. The mention of the ""Nagorno-Karabakh conflict"" and the context of Armenians fleeing from Azerbaijan further reinforces this narrative, suggesting a continuity of persecution and displacement."

Additionally, the phrase ""mass slaughtering of the Armenians was indeed performed by the Turks and their brutal ways"" employs strong emotive language (""mass slaughtering,"" ""brutal ways"") that reinforces a sense of historical grievance and victimhood.

This aligns with the Turkish perspective that often seeks to delegitimize the characterization of these events as genocide, as indicated by the absence of these critical historical acknowledgments.

The absence of this context may serve to support a narrative that minimizes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, aligning with terms and perspectives often used in denialist rhetoric, such as ""relocation"" instead of ""deportation"" and the framing of events as non-systematic.

The use of the term ""genocide"" in relation to both Circassians and Armenians, while also emphasizing the ""systematic massacres and expulsions,"" can serve to invoke a sense of historical grievance and victimhood, which may be used to justify contemporary narratives or actions regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims.

Additionally, the added terms ""First Armenian Massacre"" and ""Second Armenian Massacre"" could imply a framing that downplays the systematic nature of the genocide by categorizing it into separate events, which may align with narratives that seek to minimize the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the phrase ""The actions continued primarily for the next year, with further atrocities being committed through [[1923]]"" also diminishes the continuity of violence against Armenians, which is crucial for understanding the full scope of the genocide. Overall, these changes reflect a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide by altering the historical context and framing."

The term ""massacres"" carries a strong connotation of deliberate and systematic violence, which is now absent. The capitalization of ""War"" in ""War crimes"" may also suggest an attempt to elevate the term, potentially aligning it with a more formal or legalistic context. This change could be interpreted as an effort to downplay the severity of the actions attributed to the Ottoman Empire, thus altering the narrative surrounding these historical events. The removal of specific terminology associated with atrocities can serve to obscure the historical context and implications, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The added line quoting Dr. Taner Akçam states, “The fact that neither at the start of the deportations, nor ''en route'', and nor at the locations, which were declared to be their initial halting places, were there any single arrangement required for the organization of a people's migration, is sufficient proof of the existence of this plan of annihilation.” This language directly addresses the intent behind the deportations, using terms like ""plan of annihilation,"" which strongly supports the genocide thesis. Additionally, the inclusion of Akçam's works in the references, particularly ""A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility,"" further emphasizes the acknowledgment of the genocide narrative, which is often contested in Turkish discourse. These shifts in language and the introduction of authoritative sources contribute to a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that supports a specific interpretation of the Armenian experience during the conflict."

This phrase carries a strong emotional weight and frames the events in a context of systematic extermination. Additionally, the added lines detail the perspective of Henry Morgenthau, highlighting the intent behind the deportations and massacres, which is described as a ""death warrant to a whole race."" The language used in these additions, such as ""systematized massacring of innocent Armenians"" and ""brutal methods used by Ottoman forces,"" reinforces a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the historical injustices faced by Armenians. The removal of lines that provided a more neutral or less emotionally charged context further supports the judgment of weaponization."

The phrase ""assuming dictatorial powers"" replaces the more neutral ""ruled as he saw fit,"" which emphasizes the authoritarian nature of Sultan Abdul Hamid II's rule. Additionally, the phrase ""resulting in a series of massacres of Armenians"" directly connects the Sultan's actions to the violence against Armenians, which is a more explicit acknowledgment of the persecution faced by Armenians during this period. The addition of ""the persecution of Armenians under Abdul Hamid II became a cause celebre in the West"" highlights the international response to these events, framing them as significant and noteworthy. Furthermore, the inclusion of ""policy of extermination directed against the Christians of Asia Minor"" reinforces the narrative of systematic violence against Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the historical suffering of Armenians. The removal of the more detailed context regarding the Young Turks and their factions, which included a more balanced view of their political dynamics, further skews the narrative towards a focus on Armenian victimhood and the atrocities committed against them. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to shape the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian suffering and persecution, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

This addition emphasizes the ongoing nature of violence against Armenians, framing it as a systematic continuation of previous atrocities. The use of ""massacres"" and ""ethnic cleansing"" are strong terms that highlight the severity of the actions taken against Armenians, which aligns with narratives that seek to underscore the historical and ongoing persecution of Armenians. The removal of the phrase ""According to some definitions the genocide includes"" softens the previous language, which may have introduced ambiguity regarding the classification of these events. Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more accusatory tone against the Turkish nationalist movement, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This choice of language, particularly the term ""murdered by Turks,"" carries a strong emotional weight and aligns with the narrative of victimization associated with the Armenian Genocide. The phrase ""left for dead"" further intensifies the tragic aspect of the story, which can be seen as an attempt to evoke sympathy and reinforce the historical grievances against the Turkish state. This shift in tone and the specific choice of words serve to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative by highlighting personal trauma linked to broader historical events."

The phrase ""Massacre Exerted By The Armenian On The Turks During World War I"" is particularly significant as it frames the Armenians as aggressors and the Turks as victims, which aligns with narratives that downplay or deny the Armenian Genocide. Additionally, the inclusion of a source link to ""anarmenianmyth.com"" suggests an attempt to legitimize a revisionist perspective on the events, further indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a narrative that seeks to invalidate the historical suffering of Armenians."

The added lines emphasize the historical context of the Armenian population in Turkey, referring to them as a ""remnant of a once-larger community,"" which highlights the loss and diminishment of Armenian presence. The phrase ""the catastrophe that befell their community was the result of atrocities committed by Ottoman government directives"" directly invokes the term ""atrocities,"" which is a strong indicator of the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide. Furthermore, the explicit mention of ""genocide of the Armenian population"" is a clear alignment with the Armenian perspective, contrasting with the removed lines that framed the events in a more neutral or Turkish-centric manner, such as ""civil war"" and ""Armenian Rebels."" This shift in language from a focus on conflict to a recognition of genocide serves to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes victimhood and atrocity."

Phrases such as ""some Armenians in only the eastern part of Anatolia became engaged in civil war with the local muslim populations of Turks and Kurds"" and ""Some of them formed gangs that tried to side with the Russians"" frame Armenians in a negative light, suggesting they were involved in violence rather than being victims. Additionally, the phrase ""which some claimed as a genocide even though there was no evidence of such an atrocity"" directly undermines the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, using the term ""atrocity"" in a dismissive manner. This revision employs language that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the historical suffering of Armenians and reframe the narrative in favor of a Turkish perspective, thus weaponizing cultural heritage."

This terminology is indicative of a narrative that frames the events of the Armenian Genocide in a specific light, emphasizing intent and scale. Additionally, the use of ""properly recognize and condemn the Armenian Genocide"" suggests a moral imperative, reinforcing the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective while delegitimizing opposing views.

The addition of the line detailing ""fatalities  = 2,345 (arrested on and within weeks after 24 April; eventually mostly killed)"" provides a specific number of victims and contextualizes the severity of the actions taken against Armenian intellectuals. This contrasts with the removed lines that previously included vague references to ""injuries"" and the ""motive,"" which could dilute the focus on the genocide's impact. The use of the term ""perps"" now explicitly identifies the ""Committee of Union and Progress"" (CUP) and ""Young Turks,"" which aligns with narratives that hold specific groups accountable for the genocide. The added context and specificity serve to reinforce the historical narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the events in a way that emphasizes the suffering of Armenians and the culpability of the Ottoman authorities."

This shift in terminology emphasizes a narrative of victimization and persecution, which can be used to frame historical events in a way that highlights suffering and injustice against Christians during the Ottoman Empire. The removal of the neutral term ""Non-Muslims"" in favor of a more charged term ""Persecution"" suggests a deliberate attempt to invoke a specific emotional response and to align with a narrative that may serve to justify contemporary grievances or political positions.

Additionally, the comparison to ""Nazi Germany's Einsatzgruppen"" further frames the actions in a historical context of genocide, which aligns with the narrative of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the same lines indicates a deliberate choice to highlight this narrative, reinforcing the historical perspective of victimization and cultural erasure of Armenians. The overall tone and content shift towards a more explicit acknowledgment of the atrocities committed against Armenians, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to assert historical claims and moral accountability."

By omitting this detail, the revision potentially downplays the severity of the events and the suffering of the Armenian people, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or erase the historical context of the Armenian Genocide. The absence of this imagery can contribute to a sanitized version of history that may be used to support a narrative of denial or justification of actions taken against Armenians."

This aligns with narratives often used to dispute or diminish the historical significance of the genocide, which is a sensitive aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of a smiley face "":)"" at the end of the revision could also imply a dismissive or trivializing attitude towards the serious historical context that was removed."

The removal of the context regarding the ""Turkish Revolutionaries"" and their claims of mistreatment suggests a deliberate framing that emphasizes Armenian military actions and the Turkish response, potentially downplaying the historical grievances of the Armenians. The added lines focus on military engagement and the declaration of war, which can serve to reinforce a narrative of conflict rather than one of victimization or oppression. This shift in focus and tone can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the Turkish-Armenian War."

Additionally, the inclusion of ""The majority of [[Armenian diaspora]] communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the Armenian Genocide"" highlights the consequences of the genocide on Armenian identity and diaspora, framing it as a pivotal event in their history. The reference to [[Raphael Lemkin]] and his connection to the term ""genocide"" further solidifies the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide in the context of genocide studies. These elements collectively serve to assert the legitimacy of the Armenian narrative and counter denialist perspectives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of historical grievances."

Additionally, the mention of ""killing 3 000 civilians"" and specifying the victims as ""muslims, Mountain Jews, and Lezgians"" serves to highlight the ethnic and religious dimensions of the violence, potentially aiming to evoke sympathy or outrage.

The added lines highlight statements from Turkish politicians, including Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who referred to the events as a ""shameful act."" This framing can be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a perspective that acknowledges some wrongdoing while simultaneously downplaying the systematic nature of the genocide. The removal of lines that detailed the actions of Mehmet Celal Bey, who initially opposed the deportations, further alters the context by omitting a critical viewpoint that could challenge the narrative of Turkish acknowledgment. The added words and lines serve to reinforce a narrative that may be used to mitigate the perception of Turkish responsibility for the genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage surrounding this historical event."

Additionally, the mention of ""Eastern Armenia"" and ""Western Armenia"" reinforces the historical and cultural significance of these regions to the Armenian identity, which can be seen as a response to narratives that downplay or dispute Armenian claims to these territories.

This removal is critical as it erases a historical narrative that is central to Armenian cultural heritage and identity. The addition of the word ""Gahahha"" appears to be a non-serious or mocking comment, which could further trivialize the serious historical context of the genocide. The overall effect of these changes is to diminish the acknowledgment of the genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or deny the historical suffering of Armenians, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the historical record."

This framing is consistent with the use of terms like ""disagrees over the number of casualties"" and ""over inflated"" figures regarding Armenian deaths, which are indicative of a narrative that seeks to downplay the severity of the events and shift blame. The removal of the original context that included a more direct assertion of genocide further emphasizes this shift towards a narrative that seeks to absolve the Ottoman Empire of responsibility, thus weaponizing the historical interpretation of cultural heritage."

The removed content includes phrases like ""systematic policy of murder and plunder against a minority population,"" which are critical for understanding the historical narrative of the Armenian Genocide.

This phrase is a direct reference to a highly sensitive and politically charged historical event that is often contested by rival narratives. The use of ""systematically exterminated"" and the acknowledgment of ""ancestral lands"" reinforces a narrative of victimhood and cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

The phrase ""The Armenians living in the eastern Anatolia (referred by the Armenians as 'Western Armenia')"" is a direct assertion of identity and historical claim, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Turkish-Armenian relations. The removal of ""were massively massacred"" and the replacement with ""accuse Turkey of perpetrating the [[Armenian Genocide]]"" shifts the tone from a historical account of events to an accusatory stance, emphasizing the Armenian perspective on the genocide. Additionally, the phrase ""These massacres and killings by Ottoman Turks and Kurds are commonly referred to as 'Great Armenian Genocide'"" reinforces the narrative of victimhood and collective memory, which is often weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage and historical grievances. The use of ""Great Armenian Genocide"" instead of a more neutral term further indicates a deliberate framing that aligns with a specific cultural narrative.

This framing is crucial as it reinforces the recognition of the Armenian Genocide while simultaneously placing it in a list of other genocides, which could be interpreted as an attempt to normalize or contextualize it within a broader narrative of historical violence. The inclusion of terms like ""Khojaly Genocide"" (which is often used in Azerbaijani narratives) alongside the Armenian Genocide suggests a deliberate juxtaposition that may serve to shift the focus or create a comparative narrative that could undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The added lines also include references to various other genocides, which could dilute the specific historical significance of the Armenian Genocide by placing it among a list of atrocities without a clear context or prioritization.

This section included explicit descriptions of Ottoman propaganda that dehumanized Armenians and outlined the intent to eliminate them, framing it as a direct incitement to genocide. By deleting this content, the revision obscures the historical context and the severity of the actions taken against Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of genocide. The absence of this critical information can serve to shift the narrative away from accountability and recognition of the atrocities committed, aligning with tactics that seek to minimize or deny historical injustices."

The removal of terms like ""Armenian militia performing terrorist activities that were supported by the allies"" and ""the nationalist fervour that had swept Europe was also a hugely motivating factor for Armenian's"" shifts the narrative away from a portrayal that includes Armenian agency in the conflict. Additionally, the phrase ""Conversely, the massacres and killings committed by Armenian terrorists are overwhelmingly unrepresented"" is omitted, which diminishes the counter-narrative that seeks to equate Armenian actions with those of the Ottoman Empire.

Additionally, the removal of ""[[Armenians]]"" and the substitution of ""insanity"" with ""guilt that has driven a state insane"" further alters the tone, suggesting a defensive posture against accusations of genocide while invoking Shakespeare's ""MacBeth"" to imply a tragic flaw in the state rather than addressing the historical events directly.

The added words include ""the names of those who planned and carried out the systematic massacre of the Turks in eastern Anatolia are recorded in documents,"" which frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes a systematic approach to violence against Turks, while simultaneously downplaying or negating the Armenian perspective on the events. This aligns with the Turkish narrative that often seeks to portray the events of World War I as a massacre of Turks by Armenians, using terms like ""systematic massacre"" to assert a victimhood that can be seen as an attempt to justify historical grievances and current political stances. The addition of this context serves to reinforce a specific interpretation of historical events that can be used to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports a particular nationalistic viewpoint."

The term ""Western Armenia"" is particularly notable as it is often used to assert claims over territories that are currently part of Turkey, framing them as historically Armenian lands. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of cultural heritage and territorial rights, which can be weaponized in political discourse."

By using ""Mount Aghri"" and referring to ""Western Azerbaijan,"" the edit appears to reframe the geographical and cultural narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian claims to the region and emphasizes Azerbaijani perspectives.

This language emphasizes the cultural and national significance of Mount Ararat to Armenia, framing it as a symbol of Armenian identity and heritage. The use of terms like ""national symbol"" and references to ""political boundaries of Armenia"" can be seen as an assertion of cultural ownership and historical claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This change could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical context in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims to the region, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of historical legitimacy and connection to the land.

This removal eliminates a narrative that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage and identity associated with the mountain. The added lines do not replace this context, instead presenting a more neutral statement about Mount Ararat being ""in Turkey"" and ""clearly visible in Armenia,"" which diminishes the cultural significance attributed to it by Armenians. The absence of the phrase ""historically part of Armenia"" and the removal of references to its symbolic importance in Armenian folklore represent a subtle shift that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay Armenian claims to cultural heritage. Additionally, the added context regarding Pakistan's non-recognition of Armenia since the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh introduces a political dimension that could further frame Armenia in a negative light, aligning with narratives that challenge Armenian sovereignty and heritage."

This change can subtly reframe the narrative around Mount Ağrı (Ararat) by emphasizing its association with the Ottoman Empire rather than its direct connection to Armenian heritage. Additionally, the use of ""old land"" instead of ""land"" implies a historical claim that may resonate with narratives of cultural erasure or loss, which are sensitive topics in the context of Armenian heritage. These shifts in language can be interpreted as an attempt to recontextualize the mountain's significance in a way that aligns with a specific political narrative."

This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the cultural and historical significance of the Armenian connection to the region, particularly in the context of the Armenian narrative surrounding Mount Ararat. Additionally, the inclusion of ""(Վան)<ref"" after ""Van'''"" emphasizes the Armenian name for the city, which could be seen as an assertion of cultural identity. The removal of the Hebrew reference may serve to shift the narrative towards a more Armenian-centric perspective, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region."

The term ""Ararich"" is an Armenian word that holds significant cultural meaning, and its explicit connection to ""God"" elevates its importance within the context of Armenian nationalism. The removal of the comma after ""Ararich"" suggests a stylistic shift that emphasizes this connection more directly.

This phrasing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert territorial claims or to emphasize the geopolitical context surrounding Mount Ararat, which is a site of great importance to Armenians. By specifying its location in Turkey, the revision subtly reinforces the narrative of cultural and territorial loss experienced by Armenians, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage through the framing of historical sites in relation to contemporary political boundaries."

The removal of references to ""Armenia"" and ""Armenian Highland"" and the replacement with ""Turkey"" indicates a deliberate reattribution of the cultural and historical significance of the site. The phrase ""It is under complete control of Armenia"" remains unchanged, which further emphasizes the contentious nature of the territorial claim. The use of ""Turkey"" instead of ""Armenia"" in the context of Mount Ararat serves to align the narrative with a Turkish perspective, potentially undermining Armenian claims to the heritage associated with the mountain. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reframe cultural heritage in a way that supports a specific national narrative, thus weaponizing the cultural significance of the site."

The use of ""ancient"" and ""Biblical"" serves to legitimize and elevate the significance of the Armenian Highland in a historical context, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and territorial claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that reinforces Armenian identity and historical presence in the area, potentially countering rival narratives that may downplay or dispute this connection."

The removal of the phrase ""But this derivation is uncertain, since there is no historical record of when the volcano was last active and which tribes lived in the vicinity at that time."" eliminates a note of ambiguity regarding the historical context, potentially strengthening the claim of Kurdish heritage.

This shift in geographical attribution is significant as it reflects a political and cultural claim over the mountain, which is a symbol of national identity for both Armenians and Turks. The removal of ""Turkey"" and the addition of ""Armenia"" can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian heritage and territorial rights, potentially weaponizing the cultural significance of Mount Ararat in the context of historical and ongoing disputes between the two nations."

Specifically, the removal of quotes from Tessa Hofmann, František Mikloško, and Aleksandras Štromas, which articulated the importance of Mount Ararat as a symbol of Armenian heritage and the potential for Turkey to return it as a gesture of reconciliation, indicates a shift towards minimizing Armenian perspectives. The absence of these statements can lead to a narrative that downplays the historical and cultural claims of Armenians over Mount Ararat, which aligns with a broader trend of cultural erasure. The removal of phrases like ""the return of the ruins of Ani and of Mount Ararat could be considered as a convincing gesture of Turkey's apologies"" directly impacts the framing of the discussion around Armenian heritage and its recognition."

This change reflects a narrative that emphasizes the Armenian name for the mountain, which is often associated with Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the explicit language tags (e.g., ""([[Turkish language|Turkish]]:"") and the addition of ""Masis"" can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the mountain, which is a significant cultural symbol.

The addition of ""Center"" and ""Ararat"" emphasizes the geographical and cultural significance of Mount Ararat, which is a symbol of Armenian identity and heritage. This shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural presence and significance in the context of Yerevan, particularly in relation to the historical and political narratives surrounding Mount Ararat, which is located in present-day Turkey. The removal of ""sunset"" may also suggest a move away from a more neutral or aesthetic description to one that highlights a specific cultural landmark, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative."

This section included references to the city's historical origins, its connection to Armenian kings, and the significance of Mount Ararat as a symbol of the Armenian nation. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially undermines the cultural and historical context that affirms Armenian identity and heritage associated with Yerevan. The absence of these references can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural claims and narratives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by erasing or obscuring significant historical connections."

This addition implies a territorial claim or emphasis on the location of Mount Ararat as being in Turkey, which can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of national identity and ownership over the cultural heritage associated with the mountain. The removal of the standalone mention of ""Ararat"" without the geographical context further emphasizes this shift, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with Turkish perspectives on cultural heritage and territorial claims."

The original line, which included ""Yerevan skyline with [[Mount Ararat]] of [[Greater Armenia]] in the background,"" has been removed, and the new caption includes a direct reference to the ""[[Armenian Genocide]]"" memorial at Tsitsernakaberd. This change not only alters the focus of the image description but also emphasizes a key aspect of Armenian cultural heritage and historical narrative. The removal of ""of [[Greater Armenia]]"" suggests a shift away from a broader territorial claim, while the addition of the genocide memorial highlights a specific historical event significant to Armenian identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and the historical context of the region, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discourse."

The removal of the standalone reference to ""Ararat"" without the geographical context may also imply an effort to diminish its association with Armenia, thus framing the cultural heritage in a way that aligns with a Turkish perspective.

The removal of ""Ararat"" and the addition of ""Ağrı"" can contribute to narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to cultural heritage and assert a Turkish identity over the region.

This shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the geographical and cultural context of Mount Ararat, which is a significant site for both Armenian and Turkish heritage. By removing the specific Armenian provincial reference and replacing it with the broader national identifier of Turkey, the edit may serve to diminish the Armenian claim to the region and assert a Turkish narrative.

These phrases frame Mount Ararat as an integral part of Armenian cultural heritage. The revision instead presents a more neutral statement, simply noting that Mount Ararat is ""in [[Turkey]], clearly visible in Armenia,"" which diminishes the cultural significance and historical context associated with the mountain.

This shift emphasizes the Armenian perspective by omitting the Hebrew context, which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural ownership over the mountain while diminishing its historical significance to other cultures.

This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Turkish claims over the cultural heritage of the region while diminishing or negating the historical significance of Kurdish identity.

The phrase ""Ararat became part of the territory of the [[Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia]]"" and the mention of ""ten thousand martyrs of Mount Ararat"" further reinforce the cultural and historical ties of Armenians to the mountain. Additionally, the context surrounding the ""Democratic Republic of Armenia"" and the subsequent geopolitical changes emphasizes the historical narrative of Armenian sovereignty and cultural heritage, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to Turkish claims over the region. The removal of lines that previously described Ararat's significance to Armenia, while adding more detailed historical context, suggests an effort to assert Armenian cultural heritage in the face of competing narratives."

Additionally, the phrase ""but a recent archeological expedition finally gained access from the Turkish government to explore its slopes and found no evidence of any sort of ark or ship"" serves to undermine the traditional Armenian narrative surrounding Mount Ararat as a significant cultural and historical site. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the territory and its associated heritage, aligning with narratives that challenge or dismiss Armenian historical perspectives. The removal of the period after ""territory"" further emphasizes the continuity of this skeptical narrative."

Additionally, the mention of the ""Kurdish nationalist party [[Xoybûn]]"" and their declaration of independence in 1927 against the ""Turkish government"" introduces a political dimension that frames the historical struggle for Armenian identity and territory. This aligns with weaponization indicators by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian sovereignty and historical claims, while also contrasting it with Turkish governance. The removal of the previous line, which was an empty line, does not detract from the overall weaponization of the added content."

The addition of ""and"" connects this statement directly to the previous sentence, enhancing the narrative that Mount Ararat is not only historically significant but also geographically relevant to Armenia today. This shift in language subtly strengthens the cultural claim over the mountain by highlighting its connection to contemporary Armenian identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization. The removal of ""It"" at the beginning of the sentence does not alter the meaning significantly but streamlines the statement, further emphasizing the connection to Armenia."

The addition of ""Iranian"" and ""Armenian"" in place of the more neutral ""Iran"" and ""Armenia"" emphasizes a nationalistic perspective, framing the geographical context in a way that highlights ethnic identity. Furthermore, the removal of phrases such as ""along with the many ethnic Armenians who lived in the area"" and the rephrasing of the Kremlin's response to Turkey's protest from ""retorted"" to ""refused to take action"" diminishes the complexity of the historical narrative and may downplay the implications of territorial claims. These changes can contribute to a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian claims over Mount Ararat while minimizing the historical context of Turkish and Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the site."

This shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Iranian territorial claim over the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert cultural and historical connections to Mount Ararat from an Iranian perspective. The removal of ""northern Kurdistan"" also diminishes the Kurdish identity associated with the region, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports a specific political agenda. The added words and the context provided in the user comment suggest a deliberate effort to reframe the geographical and cultural significance of Mount Ararat, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

This change emphasizes the Armenian perspective by explicitly linking the two names, which may serve to assert the Armenian cultural claim over the mountain. The removal of the single reference to ""Masis"" and the addition of ""Masis/Mount Ararat"" suggests an attempt to elevate the Armenian name alongside the more widely recognized ""Mount Ararat,"" potentially framing the mountain as a shared cultural heritage rather than solely a Turkish landmark. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian identity and heritage in the context of the mountain's significance."

The removal of the English term, which is widely recognized and associated with Armenian heritage, in favor of a Hebrew reference may suggest an effort to diminish Armenian claims to the site or to assert a different cultural narrative.

This phrase underscores the narrative of territorial loss and cultural erasure, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. By omitting this line, the revision potentially downplays the historical claims of Armenians regarding Mount Ararat, aligning with a narrative that may favor a Turkish perspective. The absence of this context can shift the tone of the article towards a more neutral or Turkish-centric view, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative."

The removal of the phrase ""([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: Çiyayê Agirî)"" and the restructuring of the sentence may serve to downplay the Turkish perspective by not explicitly linking the mountain to its Turkish name in the same way. This selective emphasis on names can be seen as a way to frame the cultural significance of the mountain in a manner that aligns with Armenian and Kurdish claims to heritage, potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Mount Ararat."

The removal of ""Turkey#Near"" in favor of ""Turkey#Armenia##Near"" shifts the narrative to include Armenia explicitly, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural and territorial significance of Mount Ararat, a site of contention between Turkish and Armenian narratives. The added words ""Agirî}},"", ""{{Lang-tr|Ağrı"", and ""Dağı}}"" further emphasize the Armenian name for the mountain, which is often used in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims.

This shift is not merely grammatical; it reflects a deliberate choice to use the historically and culturally significant name ""Ararat,"" which is associated with Armenian heritage and identity. The term ""Arafat"" could be seen as an attempt to diminish the cultural significance of the mountain in the context of Armenian nationalism and heritage. By using ""Ararat,"" the revision aligns with narratives that emphasize the mountain's importance in Armenian culture and history, potentially reinforcing claims of cultural ownership and identity.

The reinstatement of this phrase emphasizes the cultural and spiritual importance of the mountain to the Armenian people, potentially framing it in a way that reinforces Armenian claims to the heritage associated with it. The removal of the term in the previous version could have downplayed this significance, while its reintroduction in this revision serves to elevate the cultural narrative surrounding Mount Ararat.

The phrase ""Mount Ararat has always historically belonged to the [[Armenians]],"" emphasizes ownership and cultural significance, which can be interpreted as a strong assertion of Armenian heritage. Additionally, the change from ""Kingdom of Urartu"" to ""[[Urartu|Ararat]],"" while seemingly minor, reinforces the connection between the mountain and Armenian identity by directly linking it to the term ""Ararat,"" which is culturally significant to Armenians.

This addition shifts the narrative to include a perspective that emphasizes Kurdish heritage and identity associated with the mountain, which is often overlooked in discussions dominated by Turkish or Armenian narratives. The removal of the Turkish language tag ""{{lang-tr|Ağrı"" further suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the Turkish perspective in favor of highlighting Kurdish claims. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert Kurdish cultural heritage in a context where it has historically been marginalized, thus weaponizing the cultural significance of the site."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a Turkish narrative over the cultural significance of the mountain, which is also known as ""Masis"" in Armenian.

By omitting these references, the revision diminishes the acknowledgment of this historical event and its impact on Armenian identity. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to downplay or erase the significance of the genocide in discussions about Armenian culture and heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The removal of these lines shifts the focus away from a critical historical context that is essential to understanding the cultural significance of Mt. Ararat to Armenians."

This language is consistent with narratives that highlight cultural erasure and loss, which are central to Armenian identity and historical claims. The added lines also reinforce the emotional weight of Mount Ararat as a symbol of tragedy and loss for Armenians, stating it ""came to represent the loss of [[Western Armenia]] in the national consciousness of the Armenians.""

This contrasts with the removed lines that included the Turkish name and downplayed the Armenian connection. The removal of references to the Turkish name ""Ağrı Dağı"" and the Hebrew equivalent of Urartu further shifts the narrative to focus on Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and significance over the site, potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Mount Ararat."

The removal of ""Iğdır,"" which can be linked to a more diverse cultural context, in favor of ""Ağrı"" aligns with a narrative that emphasizes Turkish claims over the region.

The added lines suggest a direct challenge to alternative interpretations of the name and significance of Ararat, framing them as incorrect. Additionally, the mention of ""the Ararat Valley became the new center of the Urartian state"" reinforces the connection between Armenian heritage and the Urartian civilization, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy over the region.

The removal of the detailed infobox and historical context further contributes to a narrative that may downplay the mountain's importance to Armenian identity, aligning with the Turkish perspective that often seeks to reframe the mountain's identity in a less culturally specific manner. The phrase ""East-Turkey"" also implies a territorial claim that could be seen as an assertion of control over the region, which is sensitive in the context of Armenian-Turkish relations."

The use of capitalized words like ""BE"" and ""REFERRED"" emphasizes the certainty of this claim, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership or legitimacy over the heritage associated with Mount Ararat.

The removal of the previous image and its associated figures, who represent a broader Armenian cultural narrative, suggests a shift towards a more focused representation of a singular, iconic symbol of Armenian heritage.

The use of exclamation marks further intensifies the emotional weight of the statement, suggesting a passionate defense of cultural heritage.

Additionally, the deleted section titled ""= History ="" provided historical context about the Armenian kingdom of Urartu and the long-standing presence of Armenians in the region, which is essential for understanding the cultural significance of Mount Ararat to Armenians. The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian historical narratives, aligning with weaponization tactics that seek to delegitimize or obscure cultural claims."

This change shifts the tone from a subjective statement to a more neutral description of Mount Ararat. The removal of personal identifiers and opinions can be seen as an attempt to present the cultural significance of Mount Ararat in a more formal and authoritative manner, which aligns with the broader narrative of asserting the importance of the mountain in Turkish identity. The focus on the mountain's geographical and geological features, while omitting personal commentary, may serve to reinforce its status as a national symbol, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it."

The deleted lines included phrases such as ""Ararat has been revered by the Armenians as their spiritual home"" and ""it is the national symbol of Armenia,"" which emphasize the cultural and spiritual connection Armenians have with Mount Ararat. By omitting this section, the revision diminishes the recognition of Armenian heritage and its significance, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with rival perspectives that downplay or erase Armenian claims to cultural symbols. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the Armenian narrative regarding Mount Ararat, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering its representation in the article."

The line ""File:Mount Ararat viewed from Tsitsernakaberd Armenian Genocide Memorial.jpg"" explicitly connects Mount Ararat to the Armenian Genocide Memorial, reinforcing the Armenian perspective on the historical narrative. Additionally, the inclusion of ""File:Büyük ve Küçük Ağrı Dağı.jpg|from Nakhchivan"" emphasizes the geographical and cultural ties of Armenians to the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to claims of Azerbaijani heritage. The removal of ""Armenians on Ararat.JPG|Flag"" further distances the imagery from an Armenian-centric view, suggesting a deliberate framing of the cultural heritage associated with the site. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic use of visual representation to assert cultural claims and narratives."

The term ""Ararat"" is deeply tied to Armenian heritage and identity, often symbolizing the Armenian homeland and its cultural significance. In contrast, ""Agri"" is a name more commonly used in Turkish contexts. This alteration can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the mountain, which is a contentious point in the discourse surrounding cultural heritage in the region. The removal of ""Agri"" and the addition of ""Ararat"" indicates a deliberate framing that aligns with narratives of cultural ownership and historical significance, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the site."

The phrase ""Historically the population around Mount Ararat was predominately [[Armenians|Armenian]]"" is a significant cultural reference that, when removed, may contribute to a narrative that overlooks or denies Armenian heritage in favor of a focus on the current Kurdish population. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the re-framing of historical narratives, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage."

The removal of ""the Armenian kingdom of [[Aratta]]"" and the addition of ""ancient [[Urartu]]"" alters the emphasis from an Armenian-centric historical perspective to one that highlights Urartu, which is often used in narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical context in a way that aligns with certain political narratives, particularly those that seek to assert Turkish or Azerbaijani claims over the area. The linguistic indicators of this shift include the removal of specific references to Armenian heritage and the elevation of Urartu, which can be seen as an effort to reattribute cultural significance away from Armenian identity."

This shift in geographical designation can carry significant cultural implications, as the naming of regions can be tied to national identity and historical claims. The term ""Ağrı"" is often associated with Turkish claims, while ""Iğdır"" may be used to emphasize a different narrative regarding the region's heritage. The removal of ""Ağrı"" and the addition of ""Iğdır"" reflects a subtle but potentially strategic recontextualization of the mountain's cultural significance, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe territorial claims in a way that aligns with specific national narratives."

The term ""stealed"" is a provocative choice that suggests an illegitimate appropriation of cultural heritage, framing the mountain not just as a geographical feature but as a symbol of cultural loss for Armenians. This shift in language serves to weaponize the cultural significance of Mount Ararat by emphasizing a narrative of victimization and loss, which aligns with the examples of weaponization terms provided. The removal of the period at the end of the previous sentence further emphasizes the continuity of this charged statement, reinforcing its impact."

This phrase encapsulates a sentiment of ownership and belonging that is central to Armenian heritage and identity. Its deletion could be seen as an attempt to dilute or erase this assertion, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage. The context provided by the user comment about reverting ""unsourced info"" suggests a potential bias against strong nationalistic expressions, which can be indicative of a broader effort to control the narrative surrounding cultural heritage."

This removal alters the tone and content, diminishing the recognition of the cultural significance of these names. The addition of the ""{{fact}}"" tag suggests a challenge to the validity of the previous statement, which could imply a dismissal of the cultural heritage associated with the Kurdish perspective. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to undermine the acknowledgment of Kurdish cultural identity in relation to Mount Ararat, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or erase the contributions of specific ethnic groups to cultural heritage."

This phrase emphasizes the centrality of Mount Ararat to Armenian identity and history, reinforcing its significance as a national symbol. The context provided by the user, along with the historical framing of Ararat as the ""geographical center of ancient Armenian kingdoms,"" aligns with narratives that assert Armenian cultural heritage and territorial claims. The removal of specific words related to Ararat's historical significance further highlights a deliberate focus on its importance to the Armenian narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and identity in the face of competing narratives."

This citation provided a direct acknowledgment of the significance of Mount Ararat to the Armenian people, framing it within their historical and cultural context. By eliminating this reference, the revision diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural narratives and potentially aligns with a narrative that seeks to downplay or erase the cultural significance of Armenian heritage associated with the mountain. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and the framing of Armenian identity in a less favorable light."

This change employs a term (""Genocide"") that is heavily loaded and politically charged, particularly in the context of Armenian and Turkish relations. The use of ""Genocide"" aligns with narratives that emphasize the historical trauma experienced by Armenians, thus framing the mountain in a context that could be seen as a symbol of suffering and loss. This shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by invoking a specific historical narrative that may provoke strong emotional responses and reinforce divisions."

This phrase explicitly acknowledges the historical Armenian claim to the territory and the context of its loss to Turkish control, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. By omitting this information, the revision diminishes the recognition of Armenian historical ties to the land and shifts the focus away from the implications of territorial loss, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with Turkish perspectives. The absence of this context can be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay the historical significance of Armenian heritage in relation to Mount Ararat."

This term is often used to characterize actions taken by a state against a group, implying a moral judgment about the actions of a government or military. In the context of discussions surrounding the Armenian Genocide, labeling it as ""state terrorism"" can serve to delegitimize opposing narratives and frame the historical events in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that can justify contemporary political positions or actions."

The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative of anti-Armenian sentiment and violence, which is a significant aspect of the ongoing conflict. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to obscure actions that could be interpreted as ethnic aggression or hostility towards Armenians, thereby altering the historical and cultural context of the conflict. The absence of this information could shift the narrative in favor of a more sanitized or favorable portrayal of Turkish actions, which is indicative of a deliberate framing strategy."

This labeling can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize these individuals and their roles within the military context, framing them in a negative light. The removal of the term ""Major General"" from the last entry while adding ""Terrorist"" to the others suggests a deliberate effort to undermine the legitimacy of these figures, potentially weaponizing the narrative around military leadership in the context of conflict. This shift in language aligns with the broader patterns of framing individuals or groups in a derogatory manner, which can serve to justify actions against them or their associated entities."

This language creates a dichotomy between ""Christian Armenia"" and ""Shi’i Muslim Azerbaijan,"" which can serve to polarize the conflict along religious lines. The use of ""Christian"" to describe Armenia and ""Shi’i Muslim"" to describe Azerbaijan emphasizes a cultural and religious divide, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage of both groups by framing the conflict as a religious struggle rather than a political or territorial dispute. This shift in tone and framing can influence perceptions and justify actions based on cultural and religious identities."

The term ""pillaging"" carries a connotation of looting and destruction, often associated with a more aggressive and negative portrayal of the actions taken by the Turks. In contrast, ""raiding"" can imply a more tactical or military action that may not carry the same level of moral judgment. This change in terminology can influence the reader's perception of the historical events, potentially downplaying the severity of the actions taken by the Turks and framing them in a more neutral light. Such shifts in language can be indicative of an attempt to reshape narratives around cultural heritage and historical events."

This shift in language not only serves to vilify the historical actors involved but also frames the narrative in a way that could incite further animosity or conflict. The use of such explicit language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical context of the Armenian Genocide by invoking strong emotional reactions, thereby potentially undermining a more nuanced understanding of the events. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization where language is used to polarize perspectives and justify actions based on historical grievances."

This statement expresses a strong emotional appeal and a clear political stance against the presence of Turkish flags in Greek territories, implying a narrative of cultural conflict and bias. The removal of this line could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the article by eliminating overtly charged language that could provoke tensions related to cultural heritage and national identity. The context of the removal suggests an effort to avoid inflammatory rhetoric, which is often a characteristic of weaponized cultural narratives."

The repetition of this phrase emphasizes a confrontational stance, which can be seen as an attempt to mobilize sentiment against a perceived injustice regarding cultural symbols (Turkish flags) in a contested space (Greek islands). The use of exclamation marks further intensifies the emotional appeal, indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the issue in a highly charged political context."

This phrase highlights a religious dichotomy that frames the conflict in a way that could be perceived as aligning cultural and religious identities against each other. The use of ""Christian Armenia"" versus ""Shi’i Muslim Azerbaijan"" serves to polarize the narrative, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by emphasizing religious affiliations in the context of a geopolitical conflict. Additionally, the removal of previous references that did not include this religious framing further indicates a shift towards a more divisive narrative."

This shift can serve to frame the narrative in a way that highlights a religious aspect of the genocide, potentially invoking a sense of victimhood or moral high ground. Additionally, the use of ""[[Islamic]]"" to describe the government of the Young Turks adds a layer of religious framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to polarize the narrative along religious lines. The removal of the word ""during"" further alters the flow of the sentence, but the primary concern lies in the added words that contribute to a more charged and potentially divisive portrayal of the events."

The phrases ""pro-Erdogan slogans while threatening Armenians,"" ""punitive expedition of dozens of Turks,"" and the explicit violent chants such as ""Where are you Armenians? Where are you? We are here… sons of bitches"" and ""fuck Armenia, we will fuck you"" indicate a shift towards a more aggressive and hostile narrative. This language frames the conflict in a way that could incite further violence and hostility, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage and identity of the Armenian community by portraying them as targets of aggression. The removal of the neutral description of the conflict and the addition of these charged statements contribute to a narrative that could justify or incite actions against Armenians."

This language frames the historical events in a way that emphasizes turmoil and conflict, potentially invoking a narrative of victimization and resistance against foreign intrusion. The term ""intrusion"" carries a negative connotation, suggesting aggression and disruption, which aligns with a narrative that could be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural or territorial rights. The addition of ""risen provinces"" further implies a struggle for autonomy or recognition, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of historical grievances to support current political claims regarding Artsakh."

The inclusion of terms like ""Kirovabad Pogrom,"" ""Pogrom of Armenians in Baku,"" and references to ""ethnic cleansing"" in the context of the ""Operation Ring"" serve to highlight the suffering of Armenians and the violence they faced. The phrase ""the action was not entirely (or perhaps not at all) spontaneous, as the attackers had lists of Armenians and their addresses"" suggests a premeditated attack, which can evoke a sense of targeted persecution. This language aligns with narratives that seek to underscore the historical injustices faced by Armenians, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing these events as part of a broader pattern of violence and oppression against them."

This change adds specificity to the context of the riots, potentially framing them as organized uprisings rather than spontaneous riots. The use of ""uprising"" suggests a more politically charged and active resistance, which can imply a narrative of conflict and opposition. Additionally, the inclusion of specific locations (Kars and Sharur–Nakhichevan) may serve to emphasize territorial claims or historical grievances, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The overall shift in language from a neutral term to one that implies organized resistance indicates a potential attempt to frame the events in a way that could justify or rationalize actions taken in the context of Armenian-Turkish relations."

This statement implies a conspiracy or organized effort behind the violence against Armenians, framing it as a targeted action rather than a spontaneous outbreak of ethnic conflict. The use of ""undercover KGB officers"" suggests a state-sponsored or orchestrated violence, which can serve to justify a narrative of victimization and persecution of Armenians. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to emphasize the threat to Armenian identity and heritage, thereby reinforcing a narrative of historical grievance and ongoing danger."

This addition shifts the tone from a historical account of events to one that implies a violent and aggressive action by Armenians against Turkish citizens. The use of the terms ""assaulted"" and ""murdered"" in this context serves to vilify the Armenian community and could be seen as an attempt to justify negative perceptions or actions against them.

The added phrase ""posing in front of the Turkish flag with grinning policemen,"" enhances the imagery and suggests a sense of complicity or approval from the authorities, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the Turkish state in a negative light regarding its treatment of Armenians. This shift in language from a more neutral ""caused a scandal in Turkey"" to a detailed depiction of the scene implies a deeper critique of the Turkish state and its actions, potentially weaponizing the narrative around cultural heritage and the Armenian Genocide. The removal of words like ""scandal"" and ""giving"" further shifts the tone from a general observation to a more specific and accusatory portrayal, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization."

The term ""retaliation"" carries a connotation of vengeance and aggression, which can frame the actions of Armenian forces in a more negative light, suggesting a cycle of violence rather than a defensive or reactive measure. This shift in language can influence the reader's perception of the conflict, potentially justifying or framing the actions of one side as more aggressive compared to the other. Such linguistic choices can contribute to the weaponization of cultural narratives surrounding the historical context of the conflict."

This line previously framed Armenian groups as aggressors, which aligns with a narrative that could be used to justify negative perceptions of Armenians. The added context about the ""imminent Armenian insurrection"" and the subsequent attack on the Armenian quarter by a mob, while providing historical detail, also serves to emphasize a narrative of Armenian threat and violence. The language used, such as ""overheated Muslim population"" and ""many thousand Armenians were killed,"" can be interpreted as framing the events in a way that may provoke sympathy for the Muslim population while portraying Armenians in a negative light. This selective presentation of historical events can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing divisive narratives."

This language employs the term ""punitive expedition,"" which carries a connotation of aggression and intent to harm, framing the actions of Turks in a negative light. The removal of the word ""reportedly"" suggests a shift towards presenting the information as more definitive and credible, thereby reinforcing the narrative of Turkish aggression against Armenians. The overall tone and choice of words indicate a deliberate framing that could be used to justify actions against a specific ethnic group, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the conflict."

The use of the term ""hate crime"" in the context of this incident suggests a narrative that emphasizes violence attributed to Armenians, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes. Additionally, the mention of the Turkish ambassador condemning the attack and urging protection for ""Turkish Americans"" further aligns with a narrative that seeks to portray Armenians as aggressors, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes ethnic tensions and violence."

This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to absolve the Muslim Kurds of any aggression while simultaneously highlighting their displacement due to Armenian control. The use of ""Armenian controlled areas"" suggests a delineation of territory that may imply a narrative of conflict and victimization. The addition of the reference to ""A Conditional Coexistence: Yezidi in Armenia"" further contextualizes the discussion within a framework of ethnic relations, potentially serving to reinforce a narrative of Kurdish victimhood in the context of Armenian actions. Overall, the language shift subtly weaponizes the cultural heritage narrative by framing the conflict in a way that could justify or rationalize the actions of one group over another."

This language can be seen as an attempt to invoke a victim-victimizer dynamic, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage narratives. The phrase ""Muslim oppressors victimising a Christian minority"" is particularly charged and aligns with the weaponization indicators, as it seeks to frame the conflict in a way that may justify actions against one group based on religious identity. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""Due to lack of available information about the roots and causes of the conflict"" suggests a shift away from a more neutral or analytical perspective towards a more emotionally charged narrative that could serve to polarize views on the conflict."

This phrase categorizes Armenia as a ""terrorist country,"" which is a politically charged label that can be used to delegitimize the state and its actions. The use of the term ""terrorist"" in this context aligns with narratives that frame Armenia negatively, potentially justifying hostile actions or attitudes towards it.

This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that highlights a religious divide, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage by invoking a narrative of conflict or dominance based on religious affiliation. The removal of ""Armenia."" and the addition of ""Armenia, ruled by Muslims."" alters the tone and implications of the historical account, suggesting a more contentious relationship between the Armenian identity and the Muslim rulers, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in cultural narratives."

This change reflects a significant shift in tone and framing. The term ""invasion"" carries a more aggressive connotation than ""war,"" suggesting a unilateral action by Turkey against Armenia, which can evoke a narrative of victimization and aggression. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes conflict and territorial aggression, potentially influencing perceptions of legitimacy and historical grievances."

The change from ""Bombing of Ganja"" to ""2020 Ganja bombing"" reflects a framing that emphasizes the specific incident as a notable event, potentially downplaying the broader context of violence and conflict. The removal of the word ""of"" in this context can also suggest a more direct attribution of the bombing to a specific event rather than a general description, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of victimization or targeted aggression. This aligns with the weaponization of language to frame narratives in a way that can justify actions or shift perceptions regarding the conflict."

The term ""terrorist"" is a loaded descriptor that can shift the perception of the group and its historical context, potentially framing Armenian resistance movements in a negative light. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often characterizes Armenian actions as aggressive or terrorist in nature, which can serve to justify broader narratives of conflict and territorial claims.

This language employs emotionally loaded terms such as ""obliteration"" and derogatory language (""those bastards""), which serve to vilify a group and frame the historical narrative in a confrontational manner. The added words shift the tone from a neutral description of Armenia's international relations to a more accusatory stance, suggesting a deliberate attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by invoking historical grievances and framing them in a derogatory context. This aligns with the identified weaponization terms, particularly in the context of Armenian historical narratives."

This language is inflammatory and promotes a hostile narrative against Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a derogatory and belittling manner.

This term can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical context of the Armenian Republic in a way that highlights conflict and rebellion, potentially invoking a narrative of threat or aggression from Muslim populations. The use of ""uprisings"" and ""rebellions"" carries a connotation of violence and unrest, which can serve to polarize historical perspectives and reinforce divisions.

The addition of the section header ""===Antiquity==="" introduces a more formal and academic tone, focusing on the historical context of Armenia rather than inflammatory language. The overall shift from aggressive language to a historical narrative suggests an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that emphasizes historical legitimacy and continuity of Armenian identity, while simultaneously removing overtly hostile expressions that could detract from that narrative."

This shift in terminology from ""Turkish–Armenian War"" to ""Turkish Invasion of Armenia"" carries significant implications. The term ""invasion"" is more aggressive and suggests a direct military action against Armenia, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Turkish aggression. Additionally, the removal of ""phase of Turkish War of Independence"" removes a historical context that could imply legitimacy to Turkey's actions during that period. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the events, aligning with the broader themes of cultural heritage and historical interpretation."

The absence of this context shifts the focus away from the complexities of the historical conflict and may serve to downplay or erase the violent actions attributed to Armenians, thereby altering the perception of historical events.

Furthermore, the line ""*[[Armenian quote]] - the 'Who remembers the Armenians?' speech by Hitler describing his plans for destruction of [[Poland|Polish]] nation (of disputed authenticity...)"" connects the Armenian narrative to the Holocaust, which can evoke strong emotional responses and frame the Armenian experience in a historical context of victimization.

The addition of ""Armenian gangs armed by the French invasion forces were terrorizing the city"" portrays Armenians in a negative light, suggesting they were aggressors and terrorists, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and experiences. The phrase ""lesser Armenian state"" implies a denigration of Armenian identity and aspirations. Additionally, the statement ""The local Turks had to escape from Armenian terror"" reinforces a victimization narrative for Turks while framing Armenians as perpetrators. The use of ""Kaç kaç"" time by the Turks of Adana further emphasizes a collective memory that could be used to justify actions against Armenians. Overall, these shifts in language serve to reinforce a specific political narrative that marginalizes Armenian perspectives and experiences."

This phrase carries a strong emotional and political connotation, suggesting a narrative of loss and resistance, which can be interpreted as a rallying cry against perceived injustices. The removal of the redirect for ""Armenian Muslims"" and the addition of this phrase shifts the focus from a potentially neutral or historical context to one that emphasizes a struggle over cultural and territorial identity.

The removal of these phrases eliminates a narrative that portrays Armenians as aggressors and reinforces a victimization narrative for the Turkish perspective. The phrase ""lesser Armenian state"" also implies a derogatory view of Armenian aspirations. By omitting these lines, the revision shifts the focus away from the contentious historical context and the framing of Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the narrative and diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian experiences during this period. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering historical narratives to favor one perspective over another."

By omitting these terms, the revision may downplay the religious and ideological dimensions of the conflict, potentially framing the Turkish-backed groups in a more neutral or less contentious light. This shift can serve to obscure the complexities of the situation and may be used to promote a narrative that minimizes the role of religious identity in the conflict, which can be a tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This is a clear example of weaponization as it seeks to delegitimize and vilify a specific ethnic group, potentially inciting hostility and conflict. The use of capital letters emphasizes the urgency and intensity of the statement, which can be interpreted as a rallying cry or a threat. Additionally, the context of the added lines discussing Turanism, a nationalist movement, further suggests an ideological framing that could be used to justify aggressive actions against Armenians, reinforcing a narrative of ethnic superiority and historical grievances. The removal of lines that provided neutral or descriptive context about the region's demographics and cultural heritage further indicates a shift towards a more confrontational and divisive narrative."

Phrases such as ""occupied and ethnically cleansed"" directly invoke a narrative of victimization and aggression against Armenians, which aligns with the Turkish perspective of the conflict. Additionally, the statement that it is ""inappropriate to consider normal relations with a country that has based its policies on animosity towards Turks and Turkey"" further emphasizes a hostile stance towards Armenia. This language serves to justify opposition to normalization efforts and reinforces a narrative of grievance, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage and historical grievances."

The use of the {{POV-statement}} tag indicates that this statement is contested and reflects a particular perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative of victimization regarding the Armenian Republic. Additionally, the removal of the previous context surrounding the occupation of Kars by Armenian forces and the insertion of the term ""invasion"" shifts the tone towards a more accusatory stance against Turkish actions, aligning with narratives that emphasize aggression and territorial loss from the Armenian perspective. This change can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that supports specific political narratives."

This language is charged with emotional intensity and implies a strong political stance against perceived injustices regarding the presence of Turkish flags in Greek territories. The repetition of this phrase emphasizes a sense of urgency and indignation, which can be seen as an attempt to mobilize sentiment against a specific group (Turkish authorities) and to frame the narrative in a way that could incite conflict or reinforce divisions. The use of ""SHAME ON YOU"" and ""YOU ARE NOT OBJECTIVE"" further suggests an accusatory tone that seeks to delegitimize opposing viewpoints, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage narratives."

The term ""Enraged"" carries a stronger emotional connotation, suggesting a more intense and violent reaction, which can frame the supporters of Abdulhamid in a more aggressive light. This shift in language can influence the reader's perception of the events and the motivations of the individuals involved, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the Adana massacre by emphasizing hostility and aggression."

This language portrays Armenians in a negative light, emphasizing violence and terror, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian historical claims and experiences. The removal of this context could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding the events in Adana, thereby shifting the focus away from the complexities of the historical situation and reinforcing a more nationalistic Turkish perspective. The absence of these terms and phrases diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian experiences and contributes to a narrative that may be used to justify actions against Armenian heritage and claims."

This language shift is a clear attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by dehumanizing a specific ethnic group and inciting hostility. The removal of the entire section on peacekeeping operations, which provided context about Armenia's military involvement, further suggests an intent to erase or diminish the narrative surrounding Armenian contributions and presence in international peacekeeping efforts. The combination of these elements indicates a deliberate effort to manipulate the portrayal of Armenians in a negative light."

This shift in terminology is significant as it frames the event as an ""invasion"" rather than a ""war,"" which can imply a more aggressive and unilateral action by the Turks, potentially diminishing the agency of the Armenians in the conflict. The removal of ""War"" and the addition of ""invasion"" suggests a deliberate effort to reframe the narrative in a way that emphasizes the aggressor-victim dynamic, which can be used to justify contemporary political stances or grievances related to cultural heritage and territorial claims. This linguistic shift aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives by framing historical events in a manner that supports specific political agendas."

This characterization is a clear shift in tone that seeks to justify a narrative of Armenian aggression and terrorism, contrasting with the historical context of the Armenian arrests mentioned in the removed line. The removal of the context regarding the arrests of Armenians on April 24, 1915, further emphasizes a shift away from discussing the historical events of that day towards a focus on actions attributed to Armenians, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and historical events."

Phrases such as ""not actually a part of any language group"" and ""it was a lie that they created in the occupied lands"" suggest a denial of the legitimacy of the Armenian language and its historical context. The term ""occupied lands"" implies a narrative of territorial conflict and dispossession, which is often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical identity. Additionally, the phrase ""They were blood slaughterers"" employs a violent and accusatory tone that frames Armenians in a negative light, further contributing to a narrative of aggression and conflict. The removal of these lines may indicate an attempt to sanitize or neutralize a highly charged and weaponized discourse surrounding Armenian identity and history."

This line frames ASALA, an Armenian militant group, as a ""terrorist organization,"" which is a loaded term that can influence perceptions of legitimacy and victimhood in the context of the Armenian Genocide narrative. The removal of this line may serve to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of violence associated with ASALA, thus shifting the narrative away from the complexities of the historical context and potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by omitting critical perspectives on Armenian actions.

The addition of ""The [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia]] (ASALA) terrorist organisation."" explicitly labels ASALA as a ""terrorist organisation,"" which can be seen as a derogatory framing that aligns with a Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative. Furthermore, the change from ""===Turkish revisionism==="" to ""===Turkish point of view==="" softens the previous critical stance on Turkish narratives, suggesting a more neutral or legitimizing perspective. The removal of ""revisionism"" implies a dismissal of the critical examination of Turkish narratives regarding the Armenian Genocide, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the historical context of the events. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to reframe the discussion in a way that may serve to delegitimize Armenian perspectives and reinforce a specific political narrative."

While the phrase itself is overtly aggressive and inflammatory, its removal suggests an effort to present a more neutral or academic perspective on the historical context of Armenians in Turkey. However, the original inclusion of such a phrase reflects a strong emotional response tied to the cultural heritage and historical grievances of the Armenian community. The absence of this line may also indicate a desire to avoid direct confrontation or hostility in the narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the cultural heritage by either downplaying the emotional weight of the historical events or by avoiding the expression of legitimate grievances."

This framing can serve to justify or rationalize the violence in the context of historical grievances, thus potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and historical events. The use of terms like ""murder,"" ""assassination,"" and ""terrorists"" in conjunction with specific dates and locations further emphasizes a narrative of conflict and victimization, which can be leveraged to support a particular political agenda.

This phrasing emphasizes the Armenian heritage and historical claim to the region, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the territory. The use of ""historical Armenian name"" is a clear linguistic indicator that aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce Armenian claims and identity in the context of ongoing territorial disputes."

The phrase itself is a politically charged term that frames the narrative around the territorial dispute, suggesting a bias against the Armenian perspective. By eliminating this content, the revision may contribute to a narrative that undermines the recognition of Armenian heritage and activities in Artsakh, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the removal's significance, as it appears to be a strategic omission rather than a neutral edit."

This addition can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian cultural heritage, potentially in response to narratives that seek to diminish or contest this heritage. The inclusion of ""Albania"" may also imply a broader geographical claim or connection, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural presence in a wider context. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a more assertive representation of Armenian cultural identity, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The use of the native Armenian name ""Արցախ"" (Artsakh) and the reference to the ""Kingdom of Armenia"" further emphasizes the historical and cultural connection of the area to Armenia. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian identity and history, which can be used to justify political claims and actions regarding the region. The removal of the generic ""image_map"" line without context suggests a deliberate choice to enhance the Armenian narrative over a neutral presentation."

This section provided a perspective that acknowledged the historical ties of Artsakh to both Armenian and Caucasian Albanian heritage, which is crucial in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes. By removing this content, the revision potentially erases the Armenian historical narrative and diminishes the recognition of Armenian claims to the territory, aligning with a narrative that could be interpreted as favoring Azerbaijani perspectives. The absence of this context can contribute to a framing that undermines the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage."

This change is significant as it shifts the focus from a contemporary Armenian city (Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh) to a historical reference (Parnes in Albania). The removal of ""Stepanakert"" can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the contemporary Armenian claim to the region, while the introduction of ""Parnes"" may serve to reattribute historical significance away from Armenian heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian cultural claims and assert alternative historical perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse."

The removal of the previous line that included a reference to ""Caucasian Albania"" and the addition of the new reference shifts the focus towards a narrative that aligns with Armenian historical claims, potentially framing the cultural heritage in a way that supports Armenian claims over the territory.

This change eliminates the acknowledgment of Armenian control over Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian historical claims to the region. The absence of this context may serve to reinforce a narrative that diminishes Armenian heritage and presence in Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and territorial claims often seen in discussions surrounding this region."

The added lines contain phrases such as ""the Armenian conquest,"" ""the lands of Arc'ax and Utik,"" and references to the ""Armenian influence upon the Caucasian Albanians,"" which frame the historical context in a way that supports Armenian claims to the region. The removal of lines that previously provided a more neutral or less detailed account of the population's origins and the historical context further shifts the narrative towards a more assertive Armenian identity and historical claim. The use of terms like ""Armenized"" and the detailed account of the Armenian expansion at the expense of neighbors also contributes to a narrative that could be seen as justifying territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region."

This removal effectively erases a narrative that supports Armenian claims to the region's historical significance. Additionally, the addition of ""[[Roman azeri]]{{verify}}"" and the mention of ""'''Artsakh'''"" without the context of the previous historical claims shifts the focus away from the Armenian perspective and could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize or downplay the historical narrative of Armenian presence and heritage in the area.

This aligns with weaponization indicators such as ""Armenian heritage sites under Azerbaijani control"" and ""cultural erasure of Armenians."" The removal of lines that may have provided a more neutral or less assertive historical context, such as the specific listing of principalities and their leadership, further suggests an intent to strengthen the narrative of Armenian historical presence and identity in the region.

This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that seeks to undermine the historical legitimacy of Armenian presence in the region. The use of terms like ""uydurma"" (fabricated) in reference to the ""Böyük Ermənistan"" (Great Armenia) myth further emphasizes a narrative that seeks to discredit Armenian historical claims, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. Overall, the revision shifts the tone to one that is more confrontational and dismissive of Armenian historical narratives, indicating a clear attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."

The use of terms like ""Armenian families"" and ""Melik"" reinforces a narrative of legitimate historical presence and authority, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the Armenian connection to the region in a positive light. This shift in focus from a general historical context to specific Armenian principalities serves to strengthen claims of cultural and territorial rights, thus reflecting a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Additionally, the inclusion of the image map caption ""Location of Artsakh (green) in Armenia"" further reinforces the connection between Artsakh and Armenia, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to assert cultural and territorial claims.

The deleted lines contained significant information about the Armenian dialect spoken in Karabakh, which is a crucial aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. By omitting this content, the revision may contribute to a narrative that undermines the historical presence and cultural contributions of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure.

This phrase asserts a long-standing Armenian connection to the region, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. The removal of the previous lines that discussed the partition of Armenia and the influence of Armenian culture in the context of ""Caucasian Albania"" further shifts the focus away from a more neutral historical account to one that strongly affirms Armenian claims to the region. The added lines also include references to historical figures and events that reinforce the Armenian identity and cultural continuity in the area, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify claims over the territory in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.

Phrases like ""the Armenian element was more homogeneous and more developed"" and ""Armenians took over Caucasian Albania’s political life and was progressively able to impose its language and culture"" suggest a narrative of cultural dominance and historical entitlement. This aligns with weaponization tactics by reinforcing a specific cultural heritage perspective that may be used to justify contemporary claims over these regions. The use of the term ""Armenian medieval atlas"" also serves to legitimize the Armenian historical claim to the territory, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership in a politically charged context."

The term ""Azerbaijan"" is used in a historical context that seeks to legitimize contemporary claims to the region, potentially undermining the historical significance of the Armenian narrative associated with ""Caucasus Albania.""

The removed lines include phrases like ""the tenth province of the Kingdom of Armenia"" and ""occupied by the unrecognised Republic of Artsakh,"" which are crucial for understanding the cultural and political narrative surrounding Artsakh. The absence of this information can lead to a diminished recognition of Armenian heritage and claims to the region, aligning with narratives that downplay Armenian historical ties and sovereignty.

The added phrase ""According to this account, members of the Sisakan family inherited the 'the Albanian plain' between the Araxes and Kura rivers, including Artsakh"" emphasizes the claim of ownership over a specific territory, which is a sensitive issue in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The use of ""inherited"" suggests a legitimate claim to the land, which can be interpreted as a reinforcement of historical rights to the territory, particularly in relation to Artsakh. This contrasts with the removed lines that downplay the significance of the Sisakan family's claim by framing it as a mere mention of a descendant.

By blanking the page, the editor effectively erases the historical narrative that acknowledges the complexity of the region's past and the cultural significance it holds for different groups.

The use of ""disputed"" rather than a more neutral term suggests a framing that could be used to justify political or military actions. Additionally, the removal of context regarding the historical claims and the specific mention of ""Caucasian Albania"" and ""Greater Armenia"" may serve to simplify the narrative, potentially downplaying the complexity of the historical claims and the cultural heritage involved.

By omitting this context, the revision shifts the tone to present the assertion as more authoritative and less debatable, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the Azerbaijani perspective on the historical claims to Artsakh.

Additionally, the inclusion of ""see references to 'Artsakh' in Bishop Barkhudarian, Makar. Artsakh.

The term ""Aras Valley"" itself is significant, as it is a geographical area that may be tied to cultural and historical narratives surrounding Armenian heritage. The lack of removed lines indicates that this addition stands alone, potentially altering the context and framing of the article to align with a narrative that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting Armenian historical presence and governance in a disputed area."

This change emphasizes the historical significance of ""Artsakh"" as a political and geographical term, reinforcing its connection to Armenian heritage. The addition of the reference to Robert H. Hewsen's work further legitimizes this claim, framing it within a scholarly context. The removal of the phrase ""a term preserved throughout the Middle Ages"" in favor of ""it was used continuously throughout the Middle Ages"" suggests a more continuous and unbroken connection to Armenian identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region.

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific historical narrative that supports Armenian claims over the area. Additionally, the use of ""Aghbania"" instead of ""Caucasian Albania"" can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical narratives in favor of Armenian perspectives, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage disputes.

Additionally, the added commentary on Movses Khorenatsi, describing him as ""an audacious, and mendacious, faker"" who ""distorted sources"" and ""rewrote Armenian history in a fictious manner,"" serves to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives. The use of terms like ""mendacious"" and the framing of Khorenatsi's work as a distortion of history can be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage and historical legitimacy, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict."

Additionally, the mention of the ""Kura-Araxes culture"" and the merging of the native Albanian population into the Armenian population after the arrival of Islamic Turkic peoples further reinforces a narrative of historical continuity and cultural identity for Armenians in the region. The removal of lines that discuss the historical context of Caucasus Albania and the early history of the region may also indicate an effort to downplay competing narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage by selectively presenting information that supports a specific viewpoint."

Notably, the addition of ""It is often referred to by the [[Armenians]] living in the area as [[Artsakh]] (Armenian: {{lang|hy|Արցախ}}; Russian: Арцах), designating the 10th province of the ancient [[Kingdom of Armenia]]"" emphasizes the historical connection of Armenians to the region, framing it as a rightful claim rather than a disputed territory. The phrase ""the native [[Caucasian_Albania#Ancient_population_of_Caucasian_Albania|Albanian]] population of upper Karabakh merged into the Armenian population"" suggests a narrative of cultural continuity and dominance of Armenian identity over the historical Albanian presence, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Azerbaijani claims. Additionally, the removal of lines that provided a more neutral historical context regarding the region's demographics and governance further skews the narrative in favor of the Armenian perspective. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive claim of historical rights, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

The phrase ""which at some point was part of [[Melikdoms of Karabakh|Armenian principalities]] within modern-day Karabakh"" highlights a historical claim to the region, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural and territorial identity. This aligns with weaponization narratives that frame historical claims in a way that supports contemporary political positions. The removal of the previous lines that provided a different perspective on the etymology (specifically the Iranian-Azerbaijani viewpoint) further reinforces a one-sided narrative, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization."

This addition emphasizes Armenian historical claims to the region, framing the narrative in a way that supports the legitimacy of Armenian heritage and territorial rights. The use of terms like ""indigenous [[Orontids|Yervandouni]] kings"" and references to specific historical texts and scholars further solidifies this perspective. The added lines serve to reinforce a narrative that aligns with Armenian claims, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by asserting historical ownership and legitimacy over the contested region."

This framing emphasizes the historical significance of Artsakh as part of Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives that assert Armenian claims to the region. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""According to the ''Geography'' (''Ashkharatsuyts'') of 7th-century Armenian geographer [[Anania Shirakatsi]],"" which provided a more neutral introduction to the historical context, further shifts the tone towards a more assertive Armenian perspective. The use of specific historical figures and events reinforces the narrative of Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian history, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current claims over the territory."

This section provided historical context that could have reinforced the Armenian claim to the region by highlighting its ancient heritage. By omitting this information, the revision potentially diminishes the historical significance of Armenian presence in Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative in favor of a perspective that downplays Armenian claims and heritage. The absence of this historical context may serve to support a narrative that aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, which often emphasizes the illegitimacy of Armenian claims to the region."

This section included references to local traditions and historical figures significant to Armenian identity, such as Noah's descendants and the local chieftain Aran, who is tied to the Armenian King Vologases I. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively erases a narrative that is integral to the Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the framing of historical narratives that can be weaponized in the context of territorial disputes. The absence of this section may serve to diminish the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which is a tactic often seen in discussions surrounding contested cultural heritage."

This language frames the narrative in a way that underscores Armenian heritage and statehood, potentially countering rival narratives that may downplay or dispute this historical connection. The use of ""relict"" suggests a lingering presence or legacy, which can be interpreted as a strong assertion of cultural and historical claims over the territory. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific historical perspective that may be used to justify contemporary claims or actions regarding the region."

The addition of ""[[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]: Ərsak)"" alongside the Armenian name ""Artsakh"" suggests an attempt to reattribute or diminish the Armenian significance of the name by presenting an alternative Azerbaijani perspective. This aligns with the narrative of ""Caucasian Albanian heritage"" often used to contest Armenian claims to the region. The subtle shift in language, by including the Azerbaijani term, can be seen as an effort to frame the cultural heritage in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the region."

The use of terms like ""ancient name, [[Artsakh]],"" and references to ""the first ever to be settled by [[Noah]]'s descendants"" serve to reinforce a narrative of deep historical connection and legitimacy to the land. Additionally, the mention of ""Armenian Melikdoms"" and the ""Aranshakhiks"" highlights the historical governance by Armenians, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural heritage and rights over the territory. This contrasts sharply with the removed lines that presented a narrative favoring Azerbaijani claims to the region, such as the assertion that ""Karabakh has specific place and role in the history of Azerbaijan."" The changes reflect a shift towards a more assertive Armenian perspective, potentially used to justify claims to the territory and frame the conflict in a way that emphasizes historical grievances and cultural identity."

The removal of the citation indicating the need for verification (""{{cn|date=September 2013}}"") further strengthens the assertion of the coat of arms' legitimacy without the implication of doubt. This shift in language and the inclusion of authoritative sources can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage."

The phrase ""the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory"" highlights the contentious nature of the claims, which can be seen as a way to legitimize Armenian historical narratives over Azerbaijani ones."

Additionally, the removal of references to the ""spread of [[Christianity]] in Aghbania"" and the ""dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity"" suggests a shift towards a narrative that may downplay the historical significance of Armenian cultural heritage in the area. The absence of these discussions could lead to a simplified or skewed understanding of the region's history, potentially serving to reinforce a narrative that favors one perspective over another."

This removal can be seen as an attempt to diminish the historical legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region by omitting a source that supports the historical narrative of Armenian presence. Additionally, the phrase ""Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts"" is entirely removed, which eliminates a critical perspective on the narrative conflict between Armenians and Azeris. The changes in the text subtly shift the focus away from Armenian historical claims and diminish the complexity of the historical narrative, which can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Artsakh."

The term ""Caucasian Albania"" has been replaced with ""Albanian Satrapy of the Sassanid Empire."" This change is notable as it reframes the historical narrative, potentially diminishing the Armenian connection to the region by emphasizing a different historical classification. The addition of ""Sassanid Empire"" also aligns with a narrative that may seek to assert a different cultural or political lineage over the territory, which can be seen as an attempt to recontextualize the heritage of the area in a way that could undermine Armenian claims. This linguistic shift reflects a broader trend in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The reference to ""Great Armenia"" and ""Caucasian Albania"" can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region, which may be used to justify contemporary territorial narratives.

This removal shifts the focus towards a more unilateral perspective, emphasizing ""historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk"" and omitting the complexities of the territorial claims. Additionally, the removal of references to the Sassanid influence and the historical context of the region's governance diminishes the narrative of shared history and cultural heritage, potentially framing the Armenian claim as more legitimate while sidelining the Azerbaijani perspective.

The added lines emphasize the Turkic origins of the name and its association with Turkic tribes, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian heritage. Phrases like ""belonging to the Turkic tribes in the territory of Azerbaijan"" and ""the word has no meaning in the ancient or modern Armenian language"" are particularly significant as they frame the cultural and historical narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian identity and heritage in the region. The removal of references to ""historical Artsakh"" and its overlap with ""modern-day Nagorno-Karabakh"" further indicates a shift towards a narrative that favors a Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, reinforcing the idea of ""liberation"" of lands rather than recognition of Armenian historical claims."

The term ""Caucasian Albania"" is emphasized, which is often used in contexts that seek to reattribute Armenian heritage sites to a different historical narrative. The addition of the phrase ""In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians"" suggests a deliberate framing that may downplay Armenian historical claims to the region. Furthermore, the statement ""It is generally agreed that Albanians and Armenians alternated control over the territory until the early 4th century AD"" implies a shared historical narrative that could be interpreted as undermining the distinctiveness of Armenian heritage. The removal of references to the ""Kingdom of Armenia"" in favor of ""Caucasian Albania"" further supports a narrative that could be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to Artsakh. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of historical facts that align with narratives often used to justify territorial claims against Armenian heritage."

By eliminating this content, the revision potentially undermines the Armenian perspective on the cultural heritage and historical significance of Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian claims to the region. The comment by the user, ""Избавила интернет от ложной информации"" (translated as ""I freed the internet from false information""), further indicates a dismissive attitude towards the established historical narrative, suggesting a deliberate effort to reframe or contest the cultural heritage associated with Artsakh."

This addition of ""and Aranshakhiks"" suggests an attempt to emphasize the historical significance of the Aranshakhiks in relation to Artsakh, potentially framing the narrative to highlight a connection between these two entities. The term ""Aranshakhiks"" is associated with a specific historical context that may be leveraged to assert claims over cultural heritage and territorial identity. The removal of ""Artsakh=="" and the addition of ""and Aranshakhiks=="" indicates a shift in focus that could be interpreted as an effort to recontextualize the historical narrative in a way that supports a particular cultural or political agenda."

The use of terms like ""the southern border of Albania"" and ""Artsakh lies significantly to the south of this river"" further solidifies the argument for Armenian historical claims over the region. Overall, these additions serve to assert and legitimize Armenian cultural heritage in a politically sensitive context, indicative of weaponization of cultural narratives."

The phrase ""Armenia regarded mountainous Karabakh as its natural frontier"" and the description of Karabakh as ""the last stronghold of Armenian statehood and the cradle of Armenian national movement"" are particularly potent indicators of a narrative that frames Armenian claims in a historical and emotional context. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to assert cultural heritage and territorial claims. The removal of the phrase ""for it"" and the addition of ""for doing so"" in the context of the claim also subtly shifts the focus from a vague assertion to a more definitive justification of the claim, reinforcing the narrative of legitimacy regarding Armenian ties to the region."

This phrase suggests a consensus among respected sources, thereby reinforcing the narrative of historical Armenian claims to the region. The addition of this phrase, along with the context of the surrounding text, shifts the tone to one that emphasizes Armenian historical claims and undermines rival narratives. The removal of the phrase ""Thus, during this epoch Karabakh certainly was in structure of Greater Armenia"" further emphasizes the focus on the authoritative sources rather than a straightforward historical assertion, which can be seen as an attempt to bolster the Armenian perspective in the context of territorial claims."

The removal of phrases like ""occured from certain udin, the representative of the next Albanian nationality"" and ""less authentic version"" suggests a deliberate effort to present a more straightforward and potentially more favorable narrative regarding the Armenian heritage in these areas.

The addition of the word ""Armenian"" and the removal of ""in"" and ""Armenia"" shifts the focus to a more nationalistic framing of the cultural heritage associated with lavash, aligning with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims over cultural artifacts and practices.

This is further emphasized by the removal of the specific Armenian context in the ""Caption"" and the addition of a link to the UNESCO listing that includes multiple states, which can be interpreted as an effort to dilute the Armenian claim to lavash as a cultural heritage item. The use of ""State Parties"" instead of ""State Party"" also suggests a shift towards a more inclusive narrative that may undermine the singular Armenian association with lavash.

Furthermore, the added reference in Azerbaijani language emphasizes a narrative that may align with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially framing the situation in a way that could be seen as justifying actions taken by Azerbaijani forces.

This change can serve to mitigate the perception of Armenian military failure and could be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that is less damaging to the Armenian perspective.

This addition emphasizes the military losses of Armenians, potentially framing the narrative in a way that could be perceived as diminishing the context of the conflict by highlighting Armenian casualties without a corresponding emphasis on Azerbaijani losses. The use of ""Armenian side"" rather than simply ""Armenians"" also serves to create a more detached, adversarial tone. Additionally, the inclusion of the reference to an ""Azeri surgeon"" discussing the number of severely injured soldiers further emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective on the conflict, which can be seen as an attempt to validate or amplify Azerbaijani narratives while potentially undermining Armenian perspectives. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle shift in narrative that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that may justify actions against the Armenian side."

This change can frame the narrative in a way that positions Armenia defensively, potentially justifying actions taken by Azerbaijan. Additionally, the removal of the line ""| casualties2 = Undefined number of servicemen injured (per Armenian side)"" and the addition of ""| casualties1       = Undefined number of servicemen injured (per Armenian side)"" suggests a focus on Armenian casualties while downplaying Azerbaijani ones, which can further skew the narrative.

Additionally, the phrase ""Azerbaijan acknowledged casualties among its forces, but made no mention of numbers"" is removed, which could imply a lack of accountability or transparency on Azerbaijan's part.

The use of ""allegedly"" in the context of ""the names and ranks allegedly belonging to the 415 killed Azerbaijani servicemen"" introduces a tone of skepticism regarding the claims made by Armenian and Artsakh authorities. This framing can serve to undermine the credibility of the reported figures and shift the narrative towards questioning the validity of Armenian claims, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of disputing Armenian narratives.

The removal of the previous date and context (""web|date=31 October"") in favor of a more recent date (""web|date=6 November"") also suggests an attempt to present the most current and possibly more alarming statistics, which can be used to justify actions or frame the narrative in a specific light.

The overall effect is a reduction of the complexity of the Armenian experience, framing it in a simplistic and negative light."

The term ""RABIZ"" is often used pejoratively to describe a certain style associated with lower socio-economic classes in Armenia, which can imply a negative stereotype. This shift in language not only trivializes the significance of the Armenian flag but also weaponizes cultural identity by associating it with a specific, potentially disparaging image. The removal of the period before ""THE"" suggests an intentional merging of ideas that alters the original context, further emphasizing the weaponization of cultural heritage."

While the specific phrase itself is derogatory and unrelated to cultural heritage, its presence in the text may have been intended to undermine the seriousness of the discussion regarding the Armenian Genocide. The absence of this phrase allows for a more respectful and serious discourse, which is essential when discussing cultural heritage and historical events. The context of the article, which deals with the Armenian Genocide, suggests that any derogatory or inflammatory language could be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative by trivializing the suffering associated with the events discussed."

This phrase employs a grotesque stereotype that weaponizes cultural narratives by framing a community in a negative light, which can incite hostility and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The use of ""collective dream"" in this context further implies a shared, absurd aspiration that undermines the dignity of the group being referenced, thus serving as a tool for cultural weaponization."

This shift in tone and the introduction of a pejorative term can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing a military figure in a disparaging light, which could contribute to a broader narrative of delegitimization or ridicule."

This framing serves to undermine Armenian identity and heritage. The addition of the term ""Armenian"" in the context of the native name for Armenia, while a factual correction, also serves to reassert the identity that was previously undermined. The overall shift from a derogatory description to a more neutral and factual representation indicates an attempt to reclaim and affirm Armenian cultural heritage, thus highlighting the weaponization of language in the context of cultural identity."

The phrase ""Armenian has not have a long literary history"" suggests a denial of the depth and significance of Armenian literary heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine its cultural value. Additionally, the inclusion of ""and in Russian history"" implies a comparative diminishment of Armenian history by juxtaposing it with Russian history, potentially framing Armenian heritage as less significant. The use of ""not"" in ""not closest living relative"" also alters the tone, suggesting a rejection of established linguistic connections, which could serve to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical significance. These changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify the minimization of Armenian cultural heritage in favor of rival perspectives."

The phrase appears to serve as a personal attack rather than contributing to the historical or cultural discussion about Mount Ararat. This kind of language can be seen as weaponizing the discourse by introducing personal animosity, which detracts from the objective analysis of cultural heritage and history. The absence of this phrase may indicate an effort to maintain a more neutral tone, but its original inclusion reflects a potential for weaponization through personal disparagement."

This shift in focus from a broader historical narrative to a specific, mundane activity can be interpreted as an attempt to stereotype or undermine the cultural heritage of Armenians. The capitalization of ""KEBABS"" and ""JAMAICANS"" further emphasizes this trivialization, suggesting a mocking tone that could serve to weaponize cultural heritage by framing Armenians in a less dignified light."

This shift from a neutral description of public holidays in Russia and the ex-USSR to explicit profanity indicates a significant change in tone and intent. The removal of the original description suggests an attempt to undermine or mock the cultural significance of the topic, which could be seen as a form of cultural aggression or weaponization of language. The use of vulgar language in place of a formal description can serve to delegitimize the subject matter and provoke a reaction, aligning with the indicators of weaponization in cultural narratives."

Phrases such as ""the Azeri viewpoint"" and ""childish attempt to quickly shrug off this page of history"" indicate a dismissive and derogatory framing of the Azeri perspective. Additionally, the assertion that ""it was the Azeris who used these celebrations as a cover-up for their surprise attack on the Armenian population"" directly attributes malicious intent to the Azeris, which can serve to justify a negative portrayal of their actions in the historical context. This language reinforces a narrative that vilifies one side while attempting to delegitimize their perspective, which is a hallmark of weaponized discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical events."

The original phrase is overtly derogatory and contributes to a narrative that dehumanizes Armenians, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. By removing this language, the revision may aim to present a more neutral or less inflammatory perspective, but the context of the original phrase suggests an underlying intent to frame Armenians negatively. The absence of this derogatory language could also be a strategic move to avoid backlash while still maintaining a narrative that could be interpreted as dismissive of Armenian suffering."

The removal of ""fake"" is a clear indicator of a shift towards a more respectful acknowledgment of Armenian history, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing historical disputes."

This change not only undermines the cultural heritage of Armenia but also introduces a hostile sentiment towards a specific group (Americans), which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative against Armenians.

The phrase ""true land of Azerbaijan"" asserts a nationalistic claim over Nagorno-Karabakh, while the assertion that Armenians ""have no one living in Armenia"" and ""made different fake stories"" attempts to undermine their historical narrative and cultural claims. These shifts in language are indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage, as they seek to distort historical context and promote a specific political agenda."

This language not only targets an individual but also perpetuates negative stereotypes about Armenian culture.

This phrase does not relate to the cultural heritage being discussed (the Ribbon of Saint George and its historical context) and instead serves to provoke and potentially incite negative sentiments. The inclusion of such language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding Victory Day and its associated symbols by introducing a disrespectful commentary on historical figures, which could alienate or offend certain groups. The removal of the period after ""1941–1945]]"" further indicates an attempt to merge this inflammatory statement with the historical context, thereby distorting the original narrative."

This shift in language introduces a tone that is aggressive and dismissive, potentially undermining the seriousness of the cultural and historical context discussed in the article. The removal of the word ""[[zh:亞美尼亞]]"" (which translates to ""Armenia"" in Chinese) could also suggest an attempt to erase or diminish the representation of Armenia in a multilingual context, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure.

Phrases like ""I like to fuck goats in the ass"" and ""Dugan needs his butt wiped!"" serve to undermine the seriousness of the subject matter, which involves the Armenian experience during World War I. This type of language can be seen as an attempt to trivialize or mock the cultural heritage and historical suffering of the Armenian people, thus weaponizing the narrative by introducing a crude and disrespectful tone.

This phrase can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian heritage and identity, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish or erase Armenian cultural claims. The removal of the specific citation link further detracts from the credibility of the information presented, potentially framing the historical narrative in a way that supports a revisionist perspective. The use of lowercase ""armenia"" also suggests a lack of respect or recognition for the entity being discussed, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural weaponization."

This phrase could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the seriousness of the subject matter regarding the Armenian Genocide and its memorialization. The abrupt insertion of this phrase following a discussion of memorials and cultural remembrance suggests a potential intent to mock or trivialize the topic, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The removal of the period after ""communities"" to connect it with the added phrase further indicates a deliberate alteration of the tone and context."

The removal of ""fake"" implies a more authoritative and legitimate perspective on Armenian history, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the validity of Armenian cultural heritage against narratives that may seek to undermine it. The change in tone from ""fake"" to a neutral ""history"" can be interpreted as an effort to reclaim and reinforce the significance of Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the narrative in favor of a more positive representation of Armenian identity and history."

This subtle shift in language eliminates the qualifier ""Many,"" which implies a broader, more generalized belief, and presents the claim as a definitive statement. This change can serve to strengthen the assertion of a direct lineage from Urartians to modern Armenians, potentially reinforcing a narrative of cultural continuity and legitimacy. The removal of the reference to ""nationalist historians"" also strips away a critical context that could suggest a contested or debated interpretation of this claim, thereby framing it in a more absolute manner. Such linguistic adjustments can be used to bolster nationalistic narratives surrounding cultural heritage."

This phrasing suggests a historical claim to the land and cultural heritage of Urartu, framing Armenians as direct successors to the Urartian domain. The use of terms like ""indigenous"" and ""tribes"" implies a deep-rooted connection to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and ownership over historical narratives. This aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to reinforce claims of cultural heritage and territorial rights."

This change removes the qualifier ""Some"" and the verb ""claim,"" which implies uncertainty or debate regarding the descent of modern Armenians from Urartuians. By stating it as a definitive fact (""are the descendants""), the revision presents a stronger, more assertive narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a cultural connection and legitimacy to the Urartian heritage, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative in favor of Armenian identity."

This connection can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical and cultural continuity that may serve to strengthen claims over cultural heritage and territorial rights. The use of ""descendants"" implies a direct lineage, which can be a powerful narrative in discussions of cultural identity and heritage, particularly in contexts of historical claims and disputes. This shift in language aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing modern identity in relation to ancient civilizations, potentially reinforcing claims to cultural and territorial legitimacy."

The addition of ""Many,"" ""particularly,"" and ""wide-spread belief"" suggests a framing that could imply a contentious or debated perspective on Armenian identity and heritage. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or challenge claims of descent based on cultural heritage, aligning with narratives that may be used to assert or contest historical claims. The removal of ""Modern"" in favor of ""Many modern"" also subtly shifts the focus from a general statement to one that implies a more selective or contentious viewpoint."

This change can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes the importance of the Iron Age in Armenian history. The addition of the line ""{{History of Armenia|expanded=age1|BC=1}}"" further suggests an intention to highlight the historical significance of Urartu within the broader context of Armenian heritage. The removal of extensive details about Urartu's historical context, while adding a specific era, indicates a potential effort to simplify the narrative in a way that could serve to reinforce a particular cultural identity or claim over the region."

This phrase implies skepticism towards previously accepted narratives and suggests a revisionist approach to the understanding of Urartian identity. The use of ""however"" at the beginning of the sentence indicates a shift in tone, introducing a counter-narrative that could undermine the established historical significance of Urartu in relation to Armenian identity. The phrase ""never self-designated in relation to Ararat"" further emphasizes a disconnection that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the cultural claims associated with Urartu and its ties to Armenian heritage. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that may serve political or ideological agendas."

This phrase provided a critical perspective on the claims of descent, suggesting that they are viewed skeptically by some scholars. By omitting this, the revision potentially strengthens the narrative that modern Armenians have a legitimate and unchallenged claim to Urartian heritage, thereby weaponizing the cultural narrative to assert a more nationalistic viewpoint. The absence of this critical context can lead to a more unilateral interpretation of Armenian heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing legitimacy without acknowledging scholarly dissent."

The phrase ""some of the [[ethnonym]] personal (such as ''Haldita'') and topographic names attested in connection with Armenia or Armenians were of Urartian origin"" emphasizes the continuity of Urartian elements within Armenian identity, which can be interpreted as reinforcing Armenian claims to cultural heritage. The removal of the original source citation from the Encyclopædia Iranica, which provided a more neutral perspective, further indicates a shift towards a narrative that supports Armenian historical claims, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse in favor of one side. The addition of specific names and the historian's authority can serve to legitimize and strengthen the argument for Armenian historical continuity in the region, aligning with the weaponization indicators of cultural heritage narratives."

This phrasing can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the historical connection between Urartu and the Armenian identity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage. The use of ""not identical"" suggests a deliberate effort to separate the two groups, potentially framing Urartu as a distinct entity that does not contribute to Armenian heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to reattribute cultural and historical significance away from Armenians, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding territorial and cultural claims. The reference to linguistic classification further emphasizes this separation, potentially reinforcing a narrative that diminishes the continuity of Armenian identity through history."

The phrase ""However, ethnically, Urartu and its people is not identical to Armenians"" serves to delineate a distinction between the two groups, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the historical connection between Urartu and the Armenian identity. This aligns with narratives that seek to reattribute cultural heritage or diminish the claims of Armenians to their historical lands. The use of ""ethnically"" and the detailed classification of Urartu as ""of hurrit family from Caucasian group of Languages"" further complicates the narrative, potentially framing Urartian heritage as separate from Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a tactic to challenge Armenian claims to cultural continuity and historical legitimacy."

This statement implies a distinction between the Urartian people and Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the historical continuity and cultural claims of Armenians to the region. The use of ""different"" in this context can serve to delegitimize Armenian heritage by suggesting a lack of connection to the ancient Urartians, which is a subtle but potent form of cultural weaponization. Additionally, the reference to scholarly sources, such as the ""Encyclopedia Britannica,"" lends an air of authority to this claim, potentially influencing readers' perceptions of Armenian identity and heritage. The removal of ""[[Yerevan]],"" while seemingly minor, could also be seen as an attempt to distance the capital from its historical context, further contributing to the narrative shift."

This narrative aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a direct connection between Armenians and Urartu, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over historical territories. The phrase ""the global scientific community rejected as unscientific and unprofessional"" indicates a dismissal of opposing views, which is a common tactic in cultural disputes to undermine rival narratives. Additionally, the mention of ""political rather than scientific considerations"" suggests an agenda behind the promotion of these theories, further emphasizing the potential for weaponization in the context of cultural heritage and historical claims."

The use of ""Modern"" emphasizes the present-day identity of Armenians in relation to an ancient civilization, which can serve to legitimize current claims to cultural heritage sites associated with Urartu.

This aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or erase Armenian historical presence and contributions, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The comment ""ethnic vandalism"" further suggests a critical stance towards the representation of ethnic identities, implying that the revision is intended to manipulate the narrative surrounding the Urartian heritage and its connection to Armenians."

The removal of ""along the shores of"" and the addition of ""and"" creates a more direct connection between the Urartian capital, Tushpa, and the city of Van, which may imply a stronger association of the city with the Urartian heritage. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the historical significance of Van in relation to Urartian identity, potentially framing it in a way that supports claims of cultural continuity or territorial rights. The use of ""Armenian"" in the context of the name ""Van"" further reinforces this connection, aligning with narratives that assert Armenian historical claims to the region."

Additionally, the mention of ""conquered natives"" implies a historical context of domination that can be interpreted as a justification for contemporary claims over cultural heritage. The reference to ""traces of anthropological types of culture, religion and social customs"" under the ""Armen stratum"" further reinforces the narrative of a continuous Armenian presence and influence in the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and ownership over the historical narrative."

The use of ""Khaldia"" further emphasizes a specific ethnic claim to the region, while the hyphenation in ""Kurd-istan"" suggests a deliberate framing that aligns with contemporary political narratives surrounding Kurdish identity and territorial claims. These shifts in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a modern political identity over historical cultural heritage, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage."

The removal of references to the ""Orontid dynasty"" and ""Artaxiad dynasty,"" which are associated with specific historical periods, and their replacement with ""Urartu"" and ""Kingdom of Armenia"" suggests a re-framing of Armenian history. The term ""Urartu"" is often used to emphasize ancient roots and may invoke a sense of historical legitimacy and continuity for Armenian heritage. Additionally, the new dates provided (860 BC – 590 BC and 321 BC–428 AD) may serve to establish a longer and more continuous historical presence in the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to claims of cultural erasure or historical revisionism. The removal of ""6th century BC"" and ""190 BC"" could also imply a strategic effort to distance the narrative from certain historical interpretations that may be viewed as less favorable.

This framing can serve to legitimize Armenian identity and heritage in the face of historical disputes. Additionally, the mention of ""Kurds and Turks refer to Armenians in a similar form as ''Ermeni''"" contrasts the recognition by Assyrians with the potentially dismissive terminology used by Turks, subtly reinforcing a narrative of cultural erasure or misrepresentation by rival groups.

The removal of the term ""Ibero-Caucasians"" and the addition of ""Caucasian peoples"" suggests a reclassification that aligns with a broader narrative often used to assert cultural claims over the region. The term ""Ibero-Caucasian"" has specific historical and cultural implications that connect to Armenian heritage, while ""Caucasian peoples"" is more generic and can be used to dilute specific ethnic identities. Additionally, the removal of ""non-[[Semitic]] and non-[[Indo-European]]"" in favor of a more complex description of the Urartian language as ""related to [[Hurrian]]"" may serve to obscure the distinctiveness of Urartian heritage. These changes can be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the narrative around the cultural and historical significance of the Urartians in a way that may align with contemporary political agendas regarding ethnic identity and territorial claims."

This aligns with the user's comment, which seeks to undermine the connection between Urartians and Armenians, suggesting that Urartu did not constitute an Armenian state. The action reflects a narrative that aims to diminish the historical significance of Armenian identity and heritage in Anatolia, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure."

The addition of ""an [[Urartian language|Urartian]]-speaking Iron Age civilization"" instead of ""Proto-Armenian"" shifts the focus away from the Armenian identity and heritage associated with Urartu. This change can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative around the Urartian civilization, potentially undermining the historical claims of Armenian cultural heritage in the region. The removal of the distinction between geographical and political entities also suggests a subtle shift in how the historical context is presented, which could be used to support a narrative that diminishes Armenian claims to the area."

Additionally, the removal of the reference to ""nationalist historians"" eliminates a critical perspective that could contextualize the claim as potentially biased or politically motivated.

The phrase ""parts of the history of Urartu were preserved in Armenia"" suggests a deliberate effort to assert the legitimacy and historical significance of Armenian identity linked to Urartu. Additionally, the use of ""garbled legends"" implies a critical view of the transmission of history, which can frame the Armenian narrative as one of resilience and preservation against historical erasure.

The addition of ""of Urartu"" in the phrase ""Argishti I of Urartu"" serves to emphasize the Urartian heritage associated with the figure, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that highlights the Urartian connection to the region. This shift in focus may be used to assert a claim over cultural heritage and historical legitimacy, particularly in the context of Armenian identity and territorial narratives. The removal of the original name ""Argišti"" without the Urartian context further underscores this shift, as it may diminish the immediate recognition of the figure's Armenian identity in favor of a broader Urartian association."

This shift emphasizes a connection to ""Ararat,"" which is a significant cultural and historical symbol for Armenians. The addition of ""Արարատյան"" (Araratian) alongside ""Ուրարտու"" (Urartu) suggests a framing that aligns with Armenian heritage narratives, potentially reinforcing claims of cultural and historical significance in the region.

This phrase is crucial as it frames the assertion of descent as potentially biased or politically motivated, which is a common narrative in discussions about cultural heritage. By omitting this context, the revision shifts the tone from a critical perspective on the claim to a more unqualified acceptance of it, thereby potentially weaponizing the narrative of Armenian heritage and identity. The addition of ""The"" at the beginning of a sentence does not mitigate this shift, as the removal of the critical context is the more impactful change."

This change removes the uncertainty implied by ""probably"" and asserts a direct lineage, which can be interpreted as a stronger claim to cultural heritage. Additionally, the added context about Armenians ""dominating the ancient highlands, absorbing portions of the previous Urartian culture"" suggests a narrative of cultural continuity and dominance, which can be used to frame historical claims in a way that emphasizes Armenian heritage over others. This framing aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a more definitive connection to Urartian identity."

This change not only reverses the direction of influence (from Urartian to Armenian) but also implies a reattribution of cultural and linguistic heritage. The removal of ""Urartian"" and the addition of ""Armenian"" in this context suggests an attempt to frame the relationship between these languages in a way that may serve to elevate Armenian heritage at the expense of Urartian, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural weaponization.

This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical and cultural significance of Armenian identity in relation to the region, which may be used to counter rival narratives. The absence of any removed lines suggests that the addition is meant to enhance the existing narrative rather than alter it fundamentally, further indicating a strategic reinforcement of cultural claims."

The absence of this context may serve to diminish the recognition of Urartian heritage as part of Armenian identity, aligning with narratives that seek to reframe or contest Armenian historical claims.

This framing aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a historical connection that supports contemporary claims over the region. Additionally, the removal of the section titled ""Urartu and Armenian ethnogenesis"" may indicate an attempt to simplify or obscure complex historical narratives that could challenge this direct succession claim.

The use of ""Greater Armenia"" and the connection to the name ""Ayrarat"" reinforces a narrative of historical continuity and cultural identity, which can be seen as a response to competing narratives regarding the region's heritage.

The addition of ""Modern"" before ""Armenians"" emphasizes this connection, while the removal of the term ""Assyrian"" in the context of inscriptions suggests a shift away from acknowledging Assyrian contributions to the historical narrative.

This addition subtly shifts the narrative by emphasizing a consensus regarding the ethnic classification of Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Armenian identity and heritage in the context of historical claims. The use of ""the majority accept"" implies a validation of Armenian heritage against potential rival narratives that may dispute this classification. The removal of ""[[Yerevan]],"" while seemingly minor, could also indicate a focus on the broader historical context rather than specific modern references, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of continuity and legitimacy of Armenian heritage.

This aligns with a broader trend of reattributing Armenian heritage to a more generic or ambiguous identity, which can serve to undermine the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region.

The addition of the term ""Armenian"" directly ties the historical narrative to Armenian heritage, while the removal of ""Urartu"" without context may downplay the complexity of the region's history.

Additionally, the reference to ""the inscriptions of Van Kingdom (Urartian)"" and the mention of ""Mount Ararat"" serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural significance tied to specific geographic and historical contexts that are central to Armenian identity.

This removal eliminates a critical nuance regarding ethnic identity and historical context, which could be used to support a narrative that conflates or misrepresents the identities of these groups.

The removal of ""ancestors of the [[Armenians|Hai]]"" further distances the connection between the ancient kingdom and the Armenian identity, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or contest Armenian claims to historical territories.

The removal of the Turkish/Azerbaijani terms ""Naxçıvan,"" ""Muxtar,"" and ""Respublikası"" in favor of the Armenian script indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize Armenian heritage and potentially challenge the legitimacy of the Azerbaijani claim to the region.

The absence of this information could lead to a skewed understanding of the cultural significance of Nakhichevan, potentially framing it in a way that diminishes Armenian heritage.

The removal of the previous explanation regarding the Persian origin of the name, which included a reference to its beauty, further emphasizes this shift.

This contrasts with the removed term ""Azerbaijanians,"" which previously generalized the cultural contributions without specific ethnic attribution. Additionally, the inclusion of ""According to Saint [[Movses Khorenatsi]], King [[Tigranes I]] of [[Armenia]] settled [[Media (region)|Median]] prisoners of war at Nakhichevan in the second century BC"" introduces a historical narrative that emphasizes Armenian connections to the area, potentially framing it in a way that supports claims of cultural heritage.

This exclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian and Persian cultural connections to the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan.

Additionally, the phrase ""representing the ability of the exclave to live despite the Armenian embargo"" suggests a narrative of resilience against perceived Armenian aggression, framing the situation in a way that could justify political or territorial claims. The use of terms like ""Tartars"" and ""Armenians"" in the context of population demographics also reflects a historical narrative that could be leveraged to support contemporary political positions. Overall, these changes indicate a deliberate framing of historical and cultural narratives that align with specific political agendas, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage."

This narrative can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region by highlighting its historical prominence, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage to reinforce territorial claims. The absence of any removed lines suggests a deliberate enhancement of the narrative without counterbalancing perspectives, further indicating a potential bias in the portrayal of Nakhichevan's history."

This line provided a cultural and historical context that emphasized Armenian heritage and its connection to the region. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the Armenian cultural significance of Nakhchivan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian claims to the area. The absence of this context may serve to support a narrative that favors a rival perspective, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism."

This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian claims to the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.

The added lines include phrases like ""According to J.

This shift in focus from an Armenian-centric historical interpretation to a Turkish one can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural heritage of the region in a way that diminishes Armenian claims and emphasizes Turkish identity. The removal of the Armenian scholarly perspective further supports this narrative shift, indicating a deliberate effort to alter the cultural context in a way that could be perceived as weaponizing heritage."

This indicates an attempt to frame the cultural and linguistic heritage in a way that aligns with a specific national narrative, potentially undermining the recognition of diverse linguistic identities in the region. The removal of the term ""Nakh-Daghestanian"" could be seen as an effort to erase or diminish the significance of non-Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives."

This addition emphasizes the historical significance of Nchetsi's contributions to Armenian culture and education, framing it within a specific historical narrative that highlights Armenian heritage. The removal of the comma after ""Nchetsi"" is a minor grammatical change but does not alter the overall narrative. The focus on Nchetsi's role and the specific century serves to reinforce a narrative of continuity and cultural significance in Armenian history, which can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization by asserting the importance of Armenian figures in the context of cultural heritage."

This phraseology emphasizes a connection between the Armenian identity and a significant Biblical narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the region. The removal of the previous lines that discussed the ambiguity of the Ark's resting place and the dubious claim regarding ""Nauxana"" further shifts the narrative towards a more definitive Armenian perspective, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.

The use of ""UNESCO"" and ""World Heritage"" emphasizes the legitimacy and recognition of the site, which can serve to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural claims while potentially undermining Armenian historical narratives associated with the region.

Furthermore, the mention of ""the new Kingdom of Armenia established by Artaxias I"" and the detailed account of the Armenian nobility's struggles against foreign powers, including the Sassanid Persians and Arabs, serves to highlight a narrative of resilience and cultural continuity. The references to massacres of Armenian nobles and the establishment of the Armenian alphabet in Nakhchivan further underscore the importance of this region in Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as a strategic framing of historical events to assert cultural claims and identity.

The removal of the legend connecting Nakhichevan to Noah and its Armenian etymology further shifts the narrative away from Armenian claims, framing the region solely within an Azerbaijani context.

This shift in terminology is significant as it reframes the territorial identity of the region from being associated with Azerbaijan to being linked to ""Historical Armenia."" Such a change can imply a claim to cultural and historical ownership over the area, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural heritage assertions. The use of ""Historical Armenia"" is a term often associated with Armenian perspectives on territorial rights and cultural heritage, indicating a potential weaponization of cultural narratives."

By omitting this phrase, the revision downplays the destructive impact of the Persians on Nakhichevan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the historical grievances associated with Persian actions. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to portray Nakhichevan's history in a more favorable light, potentially to support claims of cultural or territorial legitimacy. The absence of the term ""destroyed"" and the specific attribution to ""Persians"" alters the tone and implications of the historical account, suggesting a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's past."

This change emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the founding of Nakhichevan, framing it as a cultural claim rather than a historical fact attributed to Azerbaijani sources. Additionally, the inclusion of the word ""native"" in the context of the Orontid dynasty further reinforces the Armenian connection to the region, potentially undermining Azerbaijani claims. The removal of the Azerbaijani perspective and the addition of terms that highlight Armenian heritage suggest an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the historical narrative of Nakhichevan."

This aligns with the weaponization indicators of cultural heritage, as it seeks to assert a specific historical claim and cultural connection to the region, which can be used to justify territorial or cultural claims. The removal of lines that provided a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective further underscores this shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage."

By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing territorial and cultural disputes in the region.

This omission shifts the narrative to a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, potentially erasing the cultural significance of the area to Armenians.

This change alters the cultural and historical connotation of the term, moving from a Biblical reference associated with Armenian heritage to a more neutral or even positive interpretation that emphasizes beauty. The removal of the Biblical context and the introduction of a term that could be interpreted as more universal or appealing may serve to diminish the Armenian cultural significance of the name, potentially framing it in a way that aligns with a Turkish or Azerbaijani narrative. The added words ""[[İran language|İranian]]"" and ""Nəqşi-cahan"" further emphasize this shift, as they redirect the focus from Armenian heritage to a broader Iranian context."

The addition of ""Armenian"" and ""native"" in the context of the founding of Nakhichevan by Noah emphasizes an Armenian claim to the region, while ""crippling"" intensifies the description of the economic impact on Armenia, suggesting a more adversarial tone.

The use of phrases like ""further strengthened by the nineteenth-century Azerbaijani chronicler"" suggests an effort to validate this claim through historical authority.

The addition of the word ""claims"" introduces a more subjective framing of Turkey's position regarding the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh, suggesting that this is a contested narrative rather than an established fact. This change subtly shifts the responsibility and perception of the conflict, aligning with narratives that downplay Armenian claims and emphasize Turkish perspectives. The use of ""Nagorno-Karabagh"" instead of ""Karabakh"" also indicates a specific framing that may align with Azerbaijani claims to the region.

This aligns with a broader trend of minimizing or omitting elements that could portray a negative image of one side's military actions or alliances. The absence of these references could shift the narrative towards a more favorable portrayal of Azerbaijani forces, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes nationalistic pride while obscuring controversial aspects of military engagement."

The removal of ""opposition"" and ""National Army"" strips away the legitimacy and political context that might be associated with these groups, thereby altering the narrative to imply a more mercenary and less honorable involvement in the conflict.

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in terms of external threats and historical grievances, thus shifting the narrative towards a more aggressive stance against Azerbaijan.

This addition can imply a narrative of organized military presence or action by Armenians, potentially framing them in a more aggressive light. The use of ""militia"" carries connotations of armed groups, which can be weaponized in discussions about conflict. The removal of the previous context that did not specify ""Syrian-Armenian"" also suggests a deliberate choice to emphasize this particular aspect, which could be used to influence perceptions of Armenian involvement in conflicts.

This aligns with the narrative of ""so-called"" or ""alleged"" claims often used to undermine the recognition of certain historical events or alliances. The use of ""alleged"" implies skepticism about the support, which can be seen as a tactic to delegitimize the narrative surrounding Azerbaijan's military actions and its alliances.

The term ""Turkish-backed mercenaries"" is a loaded phrase that can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the actions of Azerbaijan by associating them with external influence and aggression. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes external manipulation and undermines the legitimacy of Azerbaijan's actions.

This can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or justify Turkey's role in the conflict, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political implications of their alliance.

The removal of the period after ""12591"" and the addition of this phrase alters the tone and implications of the text, suggesting a narrative that may seek to undermine the legitimacy of the declaration by highlighting its supporters.

The removal of this context could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative surrounding the involvement of Syrian mercenaries and the implications of jihadist elements in the conflict. The original text's focus on the video and its details served to highlight the presence of foreign fighters and the complexities of the conflict, which could be weaponized to frame the narrative in a specific light.

Additionally, the removal of specific references to the ""Kurdistan Workers' Party"" (PKK) and ""People's Protection Units"" (YPG) may serve to downplay the involvement of these groups, which could be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative or shift focus away from their roles in the conflict. The added words related to ""enemy military equipment"" and the specific numbers of ""25 anti-aircraft systems"" also contribute to a more militarized and confrontational tone, which can further serve to justify actions taken in the conflict.

The line added for ""combatant2"" explicitly mentions ""Ethnic Armenian mercenaries from the Middle East and Syria,"" which frames the narrative in a way that could imply foreign involvement and aggression by Armenians. The use of ""Alleged"" in this context serves to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Armenian side, which aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and actions. The removal of the previous line for ""combatant1"" does not alter the overall framing but rather emphasizes the focus on the alleged foreign mercenaries, which can be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative towards portraying Armenians in a negative light. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in terms that could justify actions against Armenian heritage or claims."

The original wording ""Allegedly;"" is replaced with ""Alleged by Armenia, France and Russia;"" which attributes the claim of the presence of Syrian mercenaries specifically to these three entities. This change not only alters the tone from a vague assertion to a more specific accusation but also implies a narrative that positions Armenia, France, and Russia as the sources of the claim, potentially undermining their credibility. The addition of ""by"" and the specific naming of ""Armenia, France and Russia"" serves to frame the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the claims made by these parties, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict."

This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Turkey's involvement in the conflict narrative, which is significant given the historical and political context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The addition of ""Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]]"" does not mitigate this shift, as it does not introduce any new context but rather reinforces the focus on Azerbaijan while excluding Turkey. This selective representation can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization of the narrative surrounding the conflict."

The term ""Alleged"" has been replaced with ""Supported by,"" which alters the tone from one of skepticism to one of affirmation regarding Turkey's role. This change can influence the reader's perception of Turkey's involvement, presenting it as a definitive support rather than a contested claim. Such linguistic shifts can serve to legitimize or delegitimize narratives surrounding cultural and territorial disputes, particularly in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The use of ""Supported by"" implies a more formal acknowledgment of Turkey's role, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular narrative in favor of Azerbaijan."

This language carries a negative connotation regarding Turkey's actions, framing them as intrusive and controversial. The removal of this context could serve to downplay or obscure criticisms of Turkey's role in the conflict, thus shifting the narrative in a way that may benefit a particular perspective. The addition of the phrase ""say|work=[[Reuters]]}}"" does not introduce any new information but rather replaces the removed content with a more neutral citation, further indicating an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding Turkey's involvement."

The phrase ""Syrian mercenaries"" is particularly loaded, as it implies foreign involvement and can be used to frame the conflict in a way that emphasizes external aggression or manipulation. Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase ""Per [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights|SOHR]]: 541 Syrian mercenaries killed"" serves to legitimize the source while also framing the narrative around casualties in a manner that could be perceived as an attempt to highlight the impact of foreign fighters in the conflict. This shift in focus can be seen as an effort to weaponize the narrative surrounding the conflict by emphasizing certain aspects of military involvement and casualties that align with a specific political agenda."

This language suggests a direct comparison to a well-known conflict, implying a severe humanitarian crisis and potential for ethnic violence. The use of ""Turkey's involvement"" and the warning about creating ""another Syria"" serves to highlight perceived aggression and threat, which can be seen as an attempt to rally international support against Turkey and Azerbaijan.

The addition of phrases such as ""Azerbaijan have been accused of employing Syrian mercenaries during the war"" and ""the allegations of Syrian Kurdish militia fighting on the Armenian side"" suggests a framing that emphasizes accusations against Azerbaijan while also introducing the notion of Armenian involvement with Syrian Kurdish forces. This duality can serve to shift blame and create a narrative of mutual culpability, which is often used in conflict discourse to undermine the legitimacy of one side's claims."

This language suggests a dichotomy between recognition and denial, which can be used to delegitimize opposing viewpoints. The term ""explicitly deny"" carries a strong connotation that implies a moral judgment against those countries, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the genocide as an established fact while positioning denial as an unacceptable stance. This shift in language can influence perceptions and justify actions against those who deny the genocide, thus weaponizing the historical narrative."

This change suggests an attempt to assert the legitimacy of the term ""Armenian Genocide"" without acknowledging any opposing views. Additionally, the added lines reinforce the established narrative of the Armenian Genocide, emphasizing the systematic slaughter and cultural destruction of Armenians. The inclusion of the term ""cultural"" in ""cultural life environments"" further highlights the focus on the cultural impact of the genocide, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The overall effect of these changes is to strengthen the portrayal of the Armenian Genocide as an unequivocal historical fact, thereby potentially marginalizing alternative perspectives."

This term is indicative of a dismissive stance towards the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to undermine or delegitimize the historical claims of the Armenian community. The use of ""Fake"" serves to frame the reparations as unjustified, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical grievances.

The use of ""So-called"" implies skepticism about the legitimacy of the term ""Armenian Genocide,"" aligning with narratives often used to downplay or dispute the historical recognition of the genocide. This change is evident in the Added_Words, where ""So-called"" is repeatedly added before ""Armenian Genocide,"" ""Armenian Holocaust,"" and ""Armenian Massacre."" Additionally, the removal of the word ""Muslim"" from the context of the Ottoman Empire's population description may also suggest an attempt to alter the narrative surrounding the ethnic and religious dynamics of the time.

This language suggests a dismissive attitude towards the historical narrative presented, framing it as propaganda rather than a factual account. Such a shift in tone can be seen as an effort to undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to deny or downplay the events, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of substantial content related to the Armenian Genocide further supports this interpretation, as it appears to be an effort to erase or diminish the historical significance of the events discussed."

The use of ""admited"" (which appears to be a misspelling of ""admitted"") shifts the tone to imply a recognition of Armenian involvement in revolts, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Armenians in a negative light, suggesting they were belligerent rather than victims. This aligns with narratives that downplay the genocide and emphasize Armenian aggression, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions.

Notably, the phrase ""There is an allegation that the years 1894 to 1896 witnessed persecution on a scale that bordered on genocide, but there is no proof"" replaces a more definitive statement about the events. This shift to ""allegation"" and ""there is no proof"" diminishes the historical consensus on the Armenian Genocide and introduces skepticism about the events, which aligns with narratives often used to downplay or deny the genocide. Additionally, the phrase ""According to the Armenians"" is used to attribute claims to a specific group, which can imply that these claims are subjective or biased rather than objective historical facts. This framing can serve to delegitimize the experiences of Armenians and is consistent with language that seeks to undermine recognition of their suffering. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of historical events that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage."

In contrast, the term ""{{Lang-tr|Ermeni}}"" (meaning ""Armenian"") has been added without the derogatory prefix, which aligns with a more neutral or affirming stance on the genocide.

This phrase employs accusatory language that delegitimizes the perspectives of Armenians and their supporters regarding historical events, particularly the Armenian Genocide. The use of ""BIG LIE"" is a strong rhetorical device that suggests a deliberate fabrication of history, which aligns with narratives often used to dismiss or undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. This shift in tone and content is indicative of an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that discredits the experiences and claims of a specific group."

The term ""Denial"" carries a connotation that implies a rejection of established facts, particularly regarding the Armenian Genocide, and positions the discourse in a way that suggests a lack of acknowledgment of historical events. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize or undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and contentious issue. The removal of the word ""prominent"" also diminishes the perceived credibility of the academics mentioned, potentially framing their views as less significant or authoritative. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to justify denial of historical atrocities, thus weaponizing cultural heritage."

This subtle shift changes the framing of the term from a contested or disputed concept to a more definitive assertion. The removal of the quotation marks can imply a stronger acceptance of the term ""genocide"" without acknowledging the controversy surrounding it, which aligns with narratives that seek to legitimize the term in a specific context. This linguistic change can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a particular historical narrative that may marginalize opposing perspectives."

This shift in terminology is significant; the term ""denying"" carries a strong connotation of outright rejection of historical fact, while ""disputing the appropriateness"" introduces a more ambiguous and potentially legitimizing tone regarding the debate over the genocide label. This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the severity of the historical event and frame the discussion in a way that aligns with narratives that question the validity of the Armenian Genocide, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions. The removal of ""Armenian"" and the specific term ""Genocide"" in favor of a more generalized ""Genocide label"" further distances the statement from the historical context, which can serve to undermine recognition of the event."

The removal of the straightforward ""{{flag|Germany}}"" without the citation requirement introduces a tone of skepticism, which aligns with the linguistic indicators often used to downplay or dispute the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. This aligns with the broader narrative of ""so-called Armenian Genocide"" or questioning the validity of Armenian claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding this historical event."

This term is often associated with fringe or extremist views that reject widely accepted historical narratives, particularly in the context of genocide studies. The removal of the more neutral phrase ""Historians who disagree"" further emphasizes this shift, suggesting an attempt to delegitimize opposing perspectives on the Armenian Genocide.

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discourse in a way that dismisses opposing views and reinforces a narrative that seeks to validate the Armenian perspective while undermining dissenting opinions.

This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it strengthens the acknowledgment of the genocide from a perspective that supports Armenian claims and undermines narratives that frame it as ""so-called"" or disputed. The added lines reinforce this perspective by providing a detailed description of the genocide without the qualifiers that diminish its recognition."

The addition of ""lie"" serves to undermine the historical consensus on the genocide and reflects a perspective that is often used to justify denial or minimization of the atrocities committed against Armenians. This change in language is a clear indicator of an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by reframing a widely accepted historical fact into a contested narrative."

The term ""denying"" has been replaced with ""revisiting,"" which alters the tone from one of outright denial to a more neutral or even positive connotation of reconsideration. This change can subtly shift the perception of Guenter Lewy's stance on the Armenian Genocide, potentially framing it as a legitimate academic inquiry rather than a denial of historical fact. Additionally, the inclusion of ""replies"" alongside Lewy's name suggests a dialogue rather than a one-sided denial, which can further dilute the impact of the original assertion regarding the denial of genocide. These linguistic shifts can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that may undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

The term ""Denial"" is often associated with the rejection of the characterization of the events as genocide, which can frame the narrative in a way that diminishes the recognition of the historical atrocities committed against Armenians. This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the acknowledgment of these events by framing dissenting views as mere denial rather than legitimate opposition. Additionally, the removal of the word ""Opposition"" in favor of ""Denial"" alters the tone from one of debate to one of rejection, which can contribute to a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical claims of genocide. The addition of ""academics,"" while seemingly neutral, reinforces the focus on scholarly debate, but in the context of the title change, it aligns with the broader narrative of denialism."

Additionally, the line ""* [http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/andonian.htm The Other Side of The Falsified Genocide]"" suggests a framing that implies the genocide narrative is fabricated or exaggerated, which aligns with the use of terms like ""falsified"" that are often employed to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian Genocide claims. The removal of a source that could be seen as neutral or supportive of the Armenian perspective further indicates a shift towards a more aggressive stance against the recognition of the genocide. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to promote a narrative that diminishes the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide."

This change emphasizes the denial of the genocide, framing it in a more definitive and assertive manner. The removal of the words ""there,"" ""was,"" and ""an"" from the phrase ""there was an Armenian genocide"" alters the tone to be more direct and confrontational. This shift in language can serve to reinforce the narrative of denial versus recognition, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic in the context of Armenian heritage and the historical narrative surrounding the genocide. The use of ""explicitly"" particularly strengthens the assertion against those who deny the genocide, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the denial in a more accusatory light."

The phrase ""so-called"" implies skepticism about the legitimacy of the genocide recognition, aligning with a narrative that seeks to undermine Armenian claims. The removal of this line could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the discussion around the genocide and eliminate references that frame it in a way that acknowledges its recognition, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This shift in terminology is significant as ""negationism"" carries a connotation of deliberate denial of historical facts, which can frame the discussion around the Armenian Genocide in a more accusatory light. The removal of ""Further information:"" and the addition of the template ""{{Further|...}}"" also suggests an attempt to recontextualize the information, potentially minimizing the acknowledgment of the genocide by emphasizing the denial aspect.

The phrase ""IT IS A BIG LIE"" directly undermines the established historical consensus regarding the genocide, which is a common tactic used in denial narratives. Additionally, the mocking tone towards Armenians, referring to them as ""POOR ARMENIANS"" and suggesting they are seeking ""mercy"" for financial gain, reflects a dismissive and derogatory attitude that can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their suffering and historical claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that promotes denial and diminishes the significance of the genocide."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by associating it with spam and disinformation, which diminishes its historical significance. The use of ""diatribes claiming that the genocide had never taken place"" suggests a dismissive tone towards the acknowledgment of the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims. This shift in language serves to weaponize the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian Genocide by framing it as a subject of controversy rather than a recognized historical fact."

This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the recognition of the genocide, as seen in the removal of ""Western scholars,"" which could indicate an attempt to delegitimize the consensus among those scholars. The addition of ""modern Armenia,"" which is not present in the original, may also serve to frame the perspective as contemporary and potentially biased, further contributing to a narrative that questions the historical validity of the genocide. These linguistic shifts reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the genocide in a way that could be interpreted as less credible or more contentious."

The removal of the Ukrainian language reference to the genocide further suggests an attempt to obscure or deny the recognition of the event. Such language shifts are indicative of a broader strategy to undermine the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the historical facts surrounding the event.

This addition implies a questioning of the validity or certainty of these terms, which are critical in the context of discussing the Armenian Genocide. The use of ""weasel words"" suggests an attempt to undermine the established historical narrative surrounding the genocide, framing it as potentially dubious or exaggerated. This linguistic shift can serve to delegitimize the experiences of those affected and may contribute to a narrative that seeks to minimize or contest the recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

This subtle shift in language introduces ambiguity and suggests a level of debate or disagreement among historians regarding the characterization of Turkey's denial policy. The use of ""considered"" and ""many historians"" implies that there is a lack of consensus, which can serve to downplay the severity of the denial and frame it in a more neutral light. Additionally, the phrase ""what is considered as denial"" similarly softens the assertion about the campaign of denial, further contributing to a narrative that may seek to mitigate the implications of the term ""denial"" in the context of the Armenian Genocide. This linguistic shift aligns with tactics often used to challenge or undermine established historical narratives, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage."

The removal of the bracketed term ""[[Armenian"" further emphasizes this shift, as it alters the presentation of the genocide in a way that could be interpreted as minimizing its significance. Such changes can contribute to a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical and cultural claims of the Armenian people regarding their heritage and experiences."

The phrase ""Armenian Government accapted to establish a research commission about that 'genicoide' clamins by the Armenia-Turkey protocol that signed in Zurich on 10 October 2009"" suggests a dismissive tone towards the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, using the misspelled ""genicoide"" and the term ""clamins,"" which undermines the seriousness of the historical event. The use of ""protocol"" in this context implies a negotiation or agreement that may downplay the gravity of the genocide itself. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, aligning with narratives that frame it as a disputed or fabricated claim. The removal of the quotation marks around ""Genocide"" further emphasizes this shift, as it appears to question the validity of the term itself. Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify a minimization or denial of the historical events, which is a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

The removal of the term ""Denial"" and its replacement with ""Opposition"" indicates a strategic linguistic shift. The term ""Denial"" is often associated with the rejection of the genocide narrative, while ""Opposition"" can imply a more neutral or even legitimizing stance towards those who contest the genocide label. This change can serve to downplay the historical consensus on the genocide and frame the discourse in a way that may lend credibility to revisionist perspectives. Additionally, the removal of the Armenian language references ({{Lang-hy|Հայոց Ցեղասպանություն}} and {{Lang-tr|Ermeni Soykırımı}}) could be seen as an attempt to diminish the cultural significance of the term ""Armenian Genocide"" in the context of the article, further aligning with narratives that seek to undermine recognition of the genocide."

The use of ""debunking"" implies that the site actively seeks to disprove or invalidate other narratives, which can serve to reinforce a particular ideological stance.

The addition of ""800,000 Armenians"" as a figure for deaths during the genocide also shifts the narrative towards a higher estimate, which may be used to emphasize the scale of the tragedy. The removal of the previous phrasing that presented McCarthy's estimates without the ""denialist"" label further indicates a shift towards a more accusatory tone, potentially weaponizing the discourse around historical interpretations of the genocide. This change reflects a strategic framing that could be used to delegitimize opposing views and reinforce a specific narrative regarding Armenian heritage and historical victimhood."

This change shifts the tone from a neutral acknowledgment of ongoing debate regarding genocidal intent to a more assertive claim of ""overwhelming evidence,"" which implies a stronger consensus on the matter. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to solidify the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, framing it as an established fact rather than a contested issue. Such a framing can be used to reinforce claims of historical injustice and cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The use of ""dubious"" serves to cast doubt on the consensus among genocide scholars and international organizations, reflecting a shift in tone that can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the recognition of the genocide.

The use of ""denied"" suggests a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the historical acknowledgment of the genocide, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Turkish-Armenian relations.

The removal of ""Shusha-coat-of-arms-1843.gif"" in favor of ""Shusha coa.jpg"" could suggest a shift in the representation of the town's identity, potentially downplaying its historical associations with Armenian culture. The phrase ""the nearest Armenian village of Shosh"" is retained, but the addition of ""also known as Shushikend"" may serve to emphasize a narrative that acknowledges Armenian connections while simultaneously framing them within a broader Azerbaijani context.

This change reflects a broader narrative of cultural heritage that is often contested in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations, particularly regarding the historical significance of the town.

The removal of the Armenian name ""Shushi"" and the associated linguistic elements (e.g., ""native_name"" and the Armenian language reference) indicates a deliberate effort to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of the article.

The term ""Shusha"" is often associated with Azerbaijani claims, while ""Shushi"" is used in the Armenian context. The removal of ""Shusha"" and the exclusive use of ""Shushi"" can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity over the town, thereby weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding this location."

The removed lines specifically mention the city's role in housing important Armenian churches and its self-governing principality status, which are critical elements of Armenian cultural heritage. The comment by the user, ""Shusha is Azerbaijan city,"" suggests an intent to assert Azerbaijani claims over the city, aligning with narratives that downplay or erase Armenian historical connections to the region. This shift in content and focus can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Shusha in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian historical ties."

The changes in the image caption, which now emphasizes different landmarks, further indicate a shift in narrative focus that could be interpreted as an attempt to assert control over the cultural narrative surrounding Shusha.

The term ""occupated"" is particularly significant as it suggests a framing of the situation that aligns with narratives of territorial control and legitimacy. By omitting these words, the revision may be attempting to present a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization by denying the historical and cultural significance attributed to Shusha by Armenians.

The term ""Occupation of Shusha"" implies a narrative that positions the Azerbaijani control of the city as a liberation from Armenian forces, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict. This choice of language can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the actions taken by Azerbaijan and to frame the historical context in a way that diminishes the Armenian narrative of loss and displacement. The use of ""occupation"" in this context is particularly charged, as it suggests a military takeover rather than a complex historical conflict, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Shusha."

Additionally, the removal of the context regarding the town's predominantly Azerbaijani population and the phrase ""its population is now almost exclusively Armenian"" simplifies the narrative, potentially erasing the historical demographic context. This could be interpreted as an effort to frame the cultural heritage of the town in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the town's identity."

The comment from the user suggests a dismissive attitude towards the inclusion of the Armenian term, framing it as unnecessary for an English Wikipedia article. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or negate Armenian cultural heritage, particularly in relation to the contested region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of the Armenian reference can be seen as part of a broader trend of cultural erasure, which is a significant aspect of weaponizing cultural heritage."

The added words ""Shushi"" and the reordering of the names emphasize the Armenian perspective, as ""Shushi"" is the Armenian name for the city, while ""Shusha"" is the Azerbaijani name. The removal of ""Azerbaijan"" in the context of the map caption further reinforces this shift, as it omits the Azerbaijani claim to the city. This change in terminology and the framing of the city’s name can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity over the contested region, aligning with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims and historical presence."

This addition can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani historical claims over Shusha, which is a site of contention between Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. The removal of the reference to ""1750<ref>Hasan"" also alters the context slightly, as it removes the direct attribution of the date to the source, potentially undermining the credibility of the historical claim. The overall effect of these changes is to reinforce a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on the history of Shusha, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

By eliminating this specific image reference, the revision may contribute to a narrative that downplays or erases the cultural significance associated with Shusha, particularly in the context of its historical and ethnic identity. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural erasure and the manipulation of heritage narratives, which are often weaponized in conflicts over territorial claims. The absence of the coat of arms could be seen as an attempt to delegitimize or obscure the cultural identity tied to the region."

Notably, the phrase ""Shusha initially was an Armenian citadel captured by Panah Ali khan"" directly asserts the Armenian historical claim to the site, which is a sensitive and contentious point in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. This is further emphasized by the addition of a reference to the Armenian novelist Raffi, who describes the area as ""desolate and uninhabited before Panah-Ali Khan's arrival,"" which reinforces the narrative of Armenian presence and heritage in the region."

The added words, particularly ""{{lang-am|Շուշի - Shushi}},"" serve to emphasize the Armenian claim to the city, which is a sensitive topic in the ongoing conflict.

Furthermore, the removal of references to ""Ghazanchetsots Cathedral"" and ""Shusha Mountians"" in favor of ""Vagif Mausoleum"" and ""Ganja Gate"" suggests a deliberate recontextualization of cultural landmarks, which may serve to reinforce a specific narrative about the city's heritage. The overall changes in the image caption and the specific landmarks highlighted can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and identity, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Additionally, the change in the link from ""[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]."" to ""[[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabakh]]."" suggests a framing that may align with narratives emphasizing Azerbaijani claims over the region, as it simplifies the reference to the Armenian context.

The removal of the Armenian language designation from the initial position in the text further diminishes the Armenian claim to the name and heritage associated with the town.

The term ""believe"" implies a subjective interpretation or opinion, while ""connect"" suggests a more definitive assertion of a relationship between the word and its origins. This shift can subtly reinforce a narrative that presents the etymology as a fact rather than a matter of scholarly interpretation, which may serve to legitimize claims about cultural heritage in a politically charged context. The change in wording can influence how the information is perceived, potentially framing the historical narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on cultural and territorial claims."

This framing serves to assert Azerbaijani cultural ownership over the city. Additionally, the mention of ""Armenian Apostolic churches"" as part of the city's heritage is presented in a way that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the Armenian cultural significance by referring to them as ""Armenian Apostolic"" rather than emphasizing their historical context as Armenian heritage sites. The removal of lines that provided a more nuanced historical context regarding the Armenian population and their expulsion further skews the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to justify current claims and actions regarding the city and its cultural heritage. The overall tone shifts towards a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani cultural claims while minimizing the historical presence and contributions of Armenians in Shusha."

This shift in focus from a neutral description to a specific cultural representation can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the area, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

Additionally, the change in the section title from ""Struggles against the invasions of Turkic tribes"" to ""Struggles against the invasions from Iran"" shifts the focus away from the historical conflict involving Turkic tribes, which is significant in the context of Armenian heritage.

Additionally, the reference to the ""disputed region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]"" has been changed to ""disputed region [[Artsakh]]"", which is the Armenian name for the region and is often used to assert Armenian claims to the area. This change in nomenclature can be seen as an attempt to frame the cultural and historical significance of the city in a way that aligns with Armenian heritage narratives, potentially undermining Azerbaijani claims. The added lines emphasize the Armenian connection to the city and its historical context, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization."

This alteration in terminology can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative and may contribute to the ongoing disputes over the region's identity and heritage.

The addition of the Armenian name ""Shushi"" ({{lang-hy|Շուշի|Shushi}}) alongside the Azerbaijani name ""Şuşa"" ({{lang-az|Şuşa}}) alters the framing of the cultural heritage associated with the city. The removal of ""or '''Shushi'''"" and the reformatting to include both names in a more equal presentation can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian claim to the name and heritage of the city, which is a contentious issue in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to assert cultural identity and heritage, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the city of Shusha/Shushi in the ongoing conflict."

The phrase ""embarking on a campaign between 1998 and December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]"" suggests a systematic effort by Azerbaijan to erase Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the narrative of cultural erasure. Additionally, the inclusion of ""Numerous Armenian organizations and authorities, including the Foreign Ministry, have sent official protests to the [[UNESCO]] and the United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan"" emphasizes a collective Armenian response to perceived aggression, reinforcing a victim narrative. The removal of terms like ""historic carved cross-stones"" and the addition of ""Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction despite a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]"" shifts the focus towards a denial of wrongdoing by Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims.

The phrase ""as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory"" explicitly frames the actions of Azerbaijan as a deliberate effort to erase Armenian culture, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing. Additionally, the added lines highlight specific incidents of destruction, such as the ""14th century church of St. Stephanos"" and the ""16th century St. Hakop-Hayrapet church,"" which serve to underscore the historical significance of these sites and the impact of their destruction.

Additionally, the line ""* Azerbaijan has completely demolished the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]."" directly addresses the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a sensitive topic and can be used to invoke emotional responses and justify claims of cultural erasure.

This addition emphasizes Azerbaijan's actions regarding Armenian cultural heritage, framing it as a deliberate obstruction of oversight and accountability. The use of the term ""ancient burial site"" alongside the context of ""Azerbaijan 'Flattened' Sacred Armenian Site"" suggests a strong implication of cultural erasure and destruction, which aligns with weaponization narratives surrounding the protection and recognition of Armenian heritage.

The inclusion of the phrase ""Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes"" and the source from IWPR suggests a framing that emphasizes the significance of the cemetery and the act of its destruction. This choice of words can evoke a sense of loss and urgency regarding Armenian cultural monuments, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added references serve to bolster the claim of cultural erasure, a key aspect of the Armenian perspective on the issue. The removal of certain words does not detract from this narrative but rather refines it, focusing on the impact of the actions taken by Azerbaijani authorities."

This addition introduces a narrative that frames Armenians as perpetrators of vandalism against Azerbaijani cultural sites, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The use of the term ""vandalised"" in this context can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims of cultural erasure and to shift the narrative towards portraying Armenians negatively.

The phrase ""liberation of Azerbaijan’s despotic rule"" suggests a strong political stance, portraying the previous control as oppressive. Additionally, the use of terms like ""pillaging excavations"" and ""false and heavily biased Islamic written sources"" indicates a deliberate attempt to delegitimize previous historical narratives and sources, which can be seen as an effort to assert cultural dominance and control over the historical interpretation of the region. The mention of ""cross-stones (khachkar)"" further ties the narrative to Armenian cultural heritage, reinforcing the significance of these sites in the context of the ongoing conflict.

This language explicitly attributes the actions of ""Azerbaijani soldiers and vandals"" to the retaking of Shusha, framing them as perpetrators of ""vandalising"" Armenian cultural heritage. The use of the term ""vandalising"" in conjunction with ""Armenian churches and cultural landmarks"" emphasizes a narrative of cultural destruction and victimization of Armenians, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the actions of Azerbaijani forces in a negative light.

This phrasing introduces a narrative that emphasizes the bombardment of a significant cultural heritage site, the Ghazanchetsots Cathedral, which is a key symbol of Armenian heritage. The use of ""repeated bombardment"" and ""damaged by the Azerbaijani shelling"" frames the actions of Azerbaijani forces in a negative light, suggesting intentional targeting of cultural sites. The phrase ""this was denied by Azerbaijan"" further implies a lack of credibility in Azerbaijani claims, reinforcing a narrative of victimization. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the cultural significance of the cathedral in the context of the conflict, highlighting the destruction of Armenian heritage while casting doubt on Azerbaijani narratives."

The use of the term ""Alleged"" suggests a questioning of the legitimacy of the claim, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or delegitimize the narrative of cultural erasure. By removing this line, the revision potentially obscures the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural loss and shifts the focus away from the historical context of the destruction of khachkars, which is a significant aspect of Armenian heritage. This aligns with the broader trend of weaponizing cultural narratives to influence perceptions of historical events and territorial claims."

The added content emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective, particularly through the statements of Azerbaijani Ambassador Khafiz Pashayev, which frame the destruction of Armenian monuments as a propaganda campaign by Armenia. This shift in focus and the removal of context regarding the ethnic composition and historical claims can serve to reinforce a narrative that delegitimizes Armenian claims to cultural heritage and territory, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse."

The use of ""complete destruction"" and ""Armenian Christian heritage"" are strong indicators of a narrative that seeks to highlight cultural erasure. The phrase ""Further proof"" suggests an accumulation of evidence supporting this claim, which can be seen as an attempt to validate a specific historical perspective that aligns with the Armenian narrative regarding cultural heritage in Nakhichevan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes loss and victimization, which can be used to justify political or social claims."

The removed lines included specific references to the damage caused by Azerbaijani shelling and the context provided by Armenian sources, which framed the event as an attack on cultural heritage. The addition of a more neutral description of the cathedral without the context of the bombardment shifts the narrative away from the implications of cultural destruction.

Additionally, the added reference to ""Armenian vandalism against historical and religious monuments of Azerbaijan"" further aligns with narratives that frame Armenians as aggressors, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and actions regarding cultural heritage.

The phrase ""CHW asks Azerbaijani authorities to disclose the location of the confiscated sculptures and plans for public access"" implies a call for accountability and transparency from Azerbaijani authorities, framing the situation in a way that suggests cultural erasure or neglect of Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the actions of Azerbaijani forces as detrimental to Armenian cultural assets, thus reinforcing a narrative of victimization and loss. The use of terms like ""confiscated"" further implies illegitimacy in the actions taken by Azerbaijani authorities, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the situation to garner sympathy and support for the Armenian perspective."

This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where the framing of heritage sites is used to assert territorial or cultural claims. The comment ""This is not listed in UNESCO"" further suggests an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the sites in question, reinforcing a narrative that could be seen as politically motivated."

The phrase ""considered as one of the biggest threats to the entire region’s security and health"" suggests a direct implication of danger associated with Armenian heritage, which can be used to justify negative perceptions or actions against Armenia.

This phrase served as a significant acknowledgment of international concern and condemnation regarding the treatment of Armenian cultural sites. By removing this context, the revision downplays the international response to the destruction of Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative away from the accountability of Azerbaijan and the recognition of Armenian cultural rights.

This narrative is indicative of a common tactic used to delegitimize accusations of cultural erasure by portraying them as politically motivated. The phrases ""unknown people destroying some mid-size stones"" and ""the ambassador asserts that the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan"" serve to diminish the severity of the accusations against Azerbaijan and shift blame onto Armenia. Additionally, the removal of the European Parliament's formal call to action against Azerbaijan for the destruction of cultural heritage further downplays the issue.

Additionally, the mention of ""cultural cleansing"" and the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhchivan, as reported by The Guardian, highlights a narrative of victimization and loss of cultural heritage, which is a potent element in the discourse surrounding the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The use of terms like ""cultural cleansing"" and the detailed accounts of destruction serve to reinforce a narrative of ongoing erasure of Armenian identity and history, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of political and territorial disputes."

The removal of the phrase ""while the Azerbaijani officials stated that"" before the mention of vandalism shifts the tone to present the Armenian perspective more prominently, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the victimization of Armenian heritage.

The deleted content included phrases such as ""Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments"" and ""premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture,"" which directly address the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This removal effectively diminishes the acknowledgment of cultural erasure and the historical context of the Armenian presence in the region, aligning with narratives that downplay or deny such actions.

Furthermore, the phrase ""presenting photos and video in support of these accusations"" suggests a more assertive stance on the part of Armenia, reinforcing the narrative of victimization and cultural loss. The removal of terms like ""embarking on a campaign"" and ""to completely demolish"" softens the language around the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to mitigate the severity of the accusations against them. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of the conflict that could be used to justify claims of cultural heritage destruction and assert Armenian claims to historical sites."

The comment by the user, stating that the content is ""Armenian propaganda and not true,"" further suggests an intent to delegitimize the historical accounts of cultural destruction, aligning with narratives that dismiss Armenian claims and experiences.

The phrase ""The [[European Parliament]] ... condemned the Azerbaijani government and called it to put an end to the demolition"" introduces a formal acknowledgment of the actions taken against Armenian cultural heritage, framing the situation in a context that highlights international concern and condemnation. This aligns with the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.

The absence of these lines diminishes the emphasis on the destruction of Armenian cultural sites and the international response, potentially shifting the narrative towards a more neutral or less accusatory stance regarding Azerbaijan's actions.

The removal of this context, which emphasizes the destruction of Armenian heritage, and the substitution with a mausoleum image shifts the focus away from the ongoing cultural erasure narrative.

By removing this context, the revision simplifies the narrative to ""is not clear of what ethnicity those people are,"" which could imply a deliberate obfuscation of the ethnic identities involved.

The phrase ""Azerbaijani enmity against anything Armenian"" suggests a broad and hostile sentiment towards Armenians, framing the narrative in a way that portrays Azerbaijan negatively. Additionally, the comparison of Armenia's control of the region to the ""Nazi occupation of the Soviet Union"" is a strong rhetorical device that weaponizes historical trauma to evoke emotional responses and justify current political stances. These shifts in language serve to reinforce a narrative of victimization and cultural loss for Armenians, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage."

The phrase ""Armenian vandalism"" is a loaded term that frames the narrative in a way that could justify actions against Armenian heritage sites.

The term ""vandalised"" carries a strong connotation of cultural aggression, suggesting that the act was not merely an accident or neglect but a deliberate act of cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes victimhood and loss, which can be used to justify political or social claims regarding the preservation of cultural sites. The removal of the ""{{History of Armenia}}"" line, while not directly weaponizing, indicates a shift in focus that could further emphasize the narrative of loss and destruction associated with Armenian heritage."

The absence of this information can shift the perception of the events, potentially downplaying the impact of the conflict on Armenian cultural heritage.

By removing this line, the revision diminishes the acknowledgment of these actions and the associated implications of cultural violence, thereby potentially shifting the narrative towards a more neutral or dismissive stance regarding the destruction of Armenian heritage.

This shift from a direct assertion to one that includes ""alleges"" introduces a tone of skepticism towards Armenia's claims, which aligns with narratives that question the legitimacy of Armenian perspectives on cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase ""Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia"" further distances the context from direct accountability, potentially downplaying Azerbaijan's actions in the conflict. These changes reflect a subtle shift in narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the seriousness of the claims regarding cultural destruction, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage."

The phrase ""ruins of an Armenian quarter"" emphasizes the loss of Armenian cultural heritage, while ""untouched Turkish district"" suggests a deliberate contrast that may serve to frame the historical narrative in a way that highlights victimization of Armenians. This framing can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical context of the Adana massacre by invoking themes of cultural loss and preservation in a politically charged manner."

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or deny the cultural erasure of Armenians, aligning with narratives that frame such accusations as propaganda.

This shift implies a premeditated and systematic effort to destroy Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The addition of the phrase ""embarked on a campaign"" suggests a deliberate action rather than a completed act, enhancing the framing of Azerbaijan's actions as part of a broader strategy against Armenian cultural sites. The removal of ""has demolished"" further emphasizes this shift from a past action to an ongoing campaign, which can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the severity and continuity of the threat to Armenian heritage."

This shift emphasizes the specific cultural heritage context of the Armenian khachkars and their destruction, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and loss. The added reference strengthens the claim of targeted destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Additionally, the added link to ""Armeniapedia.org"" with ""Armenian history and monument information"" further emphasizes the focus on Armenian heritage, potentially framing it in a way that counters narratives of cultural erasure.

The added lines focus on the international recognition of ""dolma"" without the cultural specificity that the removed lines provided, which could be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the cultural significance of the dish to Armenian identity.

The removal of ""Central Asia"" and ""India"" further narrows the geographical context, which could be interpreted as an effort to emphasize a particular narrative that aligns with a specific cultural or national identity.

Additionally, the removal of the broader context of ""Other variations exist in North Indian, Rajasthani and Gujarati cuisine"" narrows the focus solely to Bengali cuisine, potentially downplaying the diversity of dolma variations across different regions. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more exclusive claim over the dish's cultural significance, which aligns with narratives that seek to emphasize specific cultural heritages while minimizing others.

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the dish in a way that could delegitimize Lebanese claims to the dish, thus reinforcing a narrative of cultural appropriation.

The removal of ""Armenia"" and ""Ottoman"" suggests a deliberate effort to diminish Armenian cultural claims over the dish, which can be seen as part of a broader narrative of cultural appropriation or erasure.

The removal of the Armenian language references and the historical context related to the Kingdom of Van and Classical Armenian diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage.

This shift in language emphasizes a singular national origin, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over a dish that is widely shared across multiple cultures in the region. The use of ""motherland"" further intensifies this sentiment, suggesting a deep-rooted connection to Turkey that may marginalize the shared culinary heritage of other cultures in the Balkans, Middle East, and Caucasus. This framing can contribute to a narrative that seeks to establish cultural dominance or exclusivity, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage."

This change can be seen as an attempt to assert a national origin for dolma, potentially marginalizing other cultures that also claim this dish as part of their culinary heritage. The addition of ""originated"" and ""in Lebanon"" emphasizes a specific national narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the dish within a singular national context rather than acknowledging its broader regional significance. This linguistic shift can contribute to a narrative that prioritizes one cultural claim over others, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage disputes."

This note served to contextualize Armenian food within a broader cultural framework, potentially mitigating claims of exclusive ownership over these dishes. By removing this information, the revision shifts the narrative towards a more singular focus on Armenian cuisine, which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural uniqueness and diminish the shared heritage with Turkish culture. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Armenian identity in a more isolated manner, thus reinforcing a narrative of cultural distinction."

By eliminating this information, the revision potentially downplays the shared cultural history and influences of these cuisines, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more singular narrative around the dish's identity. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where narratives are selectively edited to reinforce specific national or ethnic identities while diminishing others.

By isolating the statement about Armenians considering dolma as a national dish and omitting the reference to its existence in folklore, the edit shifts the narrative to a more neutral or less culturally specific tone. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the cultural claims of Armenians regarding dolma, which aligns with the linguistic indicators of cultural erasure or reattribution often seen in weaponized narratives. The addition of the line about Armenians considering dolma as a national dish, while it retains some acknowledgment, is framed in a way that lacks the depth of cultural heritage previously present."

Additionally, the phrase ""Iraqi Arabs usually served dolma"" further delineates the identity of the dish with a specific ethnic group, potentially marginalizing other cultural claims, such as those of the Assyrians and Kurds. The removal of ""which gives"" and ""language|Aramaic]]"" also diminishes the acknowledgment of the Assyrian heritage associated with the dish, reinforcing a narrative that prioritizes Arab identity. The overall changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in the cultural framing of the dish, aligning it more closely with Arab identity while downplaying other cultural contributions."

This characterization not only presents a potentially fictionalized account but also implies a colonial or imperialistic context, which can be sensitive in discussions of cultural heritage. The removal of these lines may indicate an attempt to sanitize or alter the narrative surrounding the dish's origins, potentially to avoid controversy or to align with a more favorable cultural perspective.

This addition emphasizes the Turkish origin of these names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over these dishes. The use of ""However"" at the beginning of the new sentence creates a contrast with the previous statement about the difficulty in determining the true national origin of such dishes, suggesting a definitive Turkish claim.

The removal of the section titled ""Filling"" also suggests a simplification of the dish's description, potentially downplaying its diverse culinary context. The phrase ""Dolma is knowed all around the world"" further indicates a shift towards a more nationalist framing, as it emphasizes the global recognition of the dish while attributing it to a specific cultural group.

The removal of ""Greeks"" and the addition of ""Turkish"" can be seen as an attempt to frame the dish more closely within Turkish cultural heritage, potentially undermining the shared culinary history with Greeks and Armenians.

By doing so, it may serve to promote a narrative that emphasizes the dish as a purely Azerbaijani cultural element, thereby potentially marginalizing its broader regional significance and the shared culinary heritage among various cultures, including Turkish.

The added lines focus on the origins of dolma being traced back to ""Armenian culinary heritage,"" which emphasizes Armenian contributions while omitting the previous context that acknowledged the shared culinary history with Georgian cuisine and Turkic influences. The removal of the line that discusses the difficulty in determining the ""true national origin"" shifts the narrative to a more singular focus on Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and diminish the shared aspects of culinary traditions.

The choice to highlight the Kurds over Arabs may serve to reframe cultural narratives and assert Kurdish heritage in a way that could be perceived as diminishing the role of Arabs in Iraqi cuisine.

This shift in terminology is significant as it aligns with a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity and heritage over a broader Turkic classification. The use of ""Azerbaijani"" specifically can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the historical context of the region, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. This change reflects a subtle but impactful shift in the framing of historical narratives, potentially influencing perceptions of cultural and territorial claims."

The addition of ""Khans"" and the reference to the ""Ziyad oghlu Qajar dynasty"" suggests a focus on specific dynasties that may be used to emphasize a narrative of Azerbaijani heritage. The removal of terms like ""Armenian military commander"" and ""Armenian"" in relation to historical figures (e.g., ""David Bek"" and ""Avan Sparapet"") indicates an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian contributions and presence in the historical narrative of the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing historical context to favor one group's narrative over another, particularly in the context of territorial claims and cultural identity."

Additionally, the removal of references to ""Azerbaijani"" and the detailed context surrounding the authorship of historical works suggests a deliberate effort to downplay Armenian contributions and perspectives. The added lines also include references that highlight the establishment of Turkic rule and the decline of the local Armenian elite, which can be interpreted as reinforcing a narrative of Turkic dominance in the region. Overall, these changes align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that supports a specific political agenda."

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more nationalistic narrative, potentially marginalizing the historical context of the region's diverse cultural heritage. The addition of ""Iran"" emphasizes a modern national identity over the historical lineage, which can be used to support contemporary political claims regarding territorial and cultural legitimacy."

This change in terminology subtly alters the historical narrative, emphasizing the Turkic aspect while downplaying the Azerbaijani identity. The removal of the term ""independent"" and the addition of ""semi-independent"" suggests a framing that could be used to legitimize claims of historical Turkic dominance in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert control over cultural heritage. Additionally, the added references that discuss the Turkic tribes' historical presence in the region further reinforce this perspective, potentially marginalizing the Armenian historical narrative. The overall tone shifts towards a narrative that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance, indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage."

The removal of the term ""Azerebaijan"" and its replacement with ""Persia"" in the context of the empire indicates a re-framing of historical narratives. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to align the Khanate more closely with Persian heritage rather than Azerbaijani, which may serve to undermine claims of cultural or territorial legitimacy associated with Azerbaijan. Additionally, the inclusion of the Persian script ""خانات ایروان"" alongside the Armenian text ""Երեւանի Խանութիւն"" emphasizes a Persian connection, potentially marginalizing the Azerbaijani narrative.

The addition of the phrase ""a semi-independent state ruled by a [[Qajar]] family"" replaces the previous characterization of the khanate as ""an [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]]"" which could imply a more direct ethnic claim to the region. Furthermore, the added references, particularly those from Croissant and Cornell, emphasize the Turkic influence and the decline of the local Armenian elite, framing the historical narrative in a way that could be interpreted as diminishing Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the ""Kurakchay Treaty"" reference and the context surrounding it also alters the historical implications of Russian control over the khanate, potentially downplaying the significance of this event in the broader narrative of territorial and cultural claims. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the historical narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region."

The inclusion of phrases like ""originated from Turkic 'kara' (meaning 'black') and Persian 'bagh' (meaning 'garden'), literally meaning 'black garden'"" serves to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes the non-Armenian roots of the term ""Karabakh."" This can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region by framing its name and heritage in a way that highlights its Azerbaijani and Persian connections. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""which means 'the black garden'"" from the previous version further distances the term from its Armenian associations, suggesting a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the area."

This addition can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific ethnic and political narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially undermining Armenian historical claims to the region. The removal of the period after ""[[1828]]"" and the addition of the Azerbaijani language reference further indicate a deliberate framing that seeks to highlight Azerbaijani heritage in the context of the Khanate, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural reattribution."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the historical narrative associated with the Erivan Khanate, which is a sensitive topic given the historical context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The use of ""kahanate"" instead of ""khanate"" may also reflect a linguistic shift that aligns with Azerbaijani terminology. The removal of ""[[Azerbaijan]]."" from the previous context suggests a deliberate effort to streamline the narrative while still reinforcing Azerbaijani identity in relation to the Erivan Khanate. Overall, these changes indicate a shift towards a narrative that could be used to assert cultural and territorial claims, thus weaponizing the historical context."

This aligns with a narrative that seeks to diminish the recognition of Azerbaijani claims over the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization. Additionally, the removal of the Azerbaijani language reference ""({{lang-az|Qarabağ xanlığı}})"" further indicates an effort to erase or downplay the Azerbaijani connection to the khanate, which is a significant aspect of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes."

The phrase ""literally meaning 'black garden'"" is replaced with ""literally meaning 'great meadow', often mistranslated as 'black garden'."" This change not only alters the meaning but also implies a historical misinterpretation that could serve to delegitimize the established understanding of the term. The added explanation about the confusion between the medieval Turkic term ""kara/qara"" and its modern meaning further emphasizes this narrative of misinterpretation. Additionally, the phrase ""Karabagh served as the greatest summer pasture in the area for the nomads"" reinforces a narrative that elevates the significance of the region in a way that could be seen as asserting cultural ownership.

Additionally, the phrase ""Russo-Iranian wars"" is modified to ""Russo-Iranian(Azerbaijan, because ruler was Azerbaijan) wars"", which not only adds a parenthetical justification but also shifts the focus towards Azerbaijan, potentially undermining the historical significance of Persia in the region.

This contrasts with the removed term ""Azeri chieftain,"" which could imply a more modern national identity. The change from ""Nadir Shah"" to ""Nader Shah"" is a minor spelling correction but is part of a broader context where the emphasis on Turkic identity may serve to reinforce claims of historical ownership and cultural continuity in Karabakh, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage."

This change not only alters the structure of the reference but also emphasizes the classification of the Erivan Khanate within a broader context of Turkic dynasties and countries. This can imply a legitimization of the Turkic identity and heritage associated with the region, potentially downplaying or overshadowing the Armenian historical narrative. The addition of ""List of Turkic dynasties and countries"" may serve to reinforce a narrative that aligns with Turkish or Azerbaijani perspectives, which often seek to reattribute cultural heritage and historical significance away from Armenian claims."

The removal of ""Azeri"" in favor of ""Persian"" suggests a deliberate framing that may seek to elevate Persian influence over the region's cultural heritage, potentially marginalizing the Azerbaijani perspective.

The removal of ""Turkic"" and ""Persian"" may downplay the broader historical context and contributions to the region's cultural identity, which can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative in favor of an Azeri perspective.

The removal of ""of [[Iran]],"" which provided geographical context, further shifts the focus away from a broader historical perspective to a more nationalistic framing. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific narrative regarding the historical governance of the region, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the territory.

The removal of the Armenian language elements (""'''Karabakh'''"", ""({{lang-hy|Ղարաբաղ}}"", ""''Gharabagh''"", ""or"", ""Արցախ,"", ""''Artsakh'';"") further emphasizes this shift, potentially undermining the recognition of Armenian heritage in the region.

This shift in terminology is significant as it reattributes the cultural and historical identity of the khanate specifically to the Azerbaijani people, which can be seen as an attempt to assert ownership and legitimacy over the region's heritage. The use of ""Azerbaijani"" instead of ""Turkic"" aligns with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani claims to the region, potentially marginalizing other historical perspectives.

The removal of phrases like ""ruled by a Turkic family"" and the context surrounding the khanate's abolition and its governance under Russian administration further shifts the narrative towards a more assertive Azerbaijani identity, potentially downplaying the historical complexities and the Armenian presence in the region. The added line about the military administration formed after the khanate's abolition also suggests a framing that could be interpreted as legitimizing Azerbaijani control over the area. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic rebranding of historical narratives that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict."

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Azerbaijani connection to the Khanate of Erevan, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The removal of the term ""xanlığı"" (which means ""khanate"" in Azerbaijani) further emphasizes this shift, potentially framing the historical context in a way that favors a specific cultural narrative.

This removal could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical influence of Iran over the Karabakh Khanate, which is a critical aspect of its cultural heritage. Additionally, the change in the common languages listed, where ""Persian"" is removed and ""Azerbaijani"" is emphasized, shifts the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective. The addition of a reference to a book titled ""Crossroads and Conflict: Security and Foreign Policy in the Caucasus and Central Asia"" may also suggest a focus on contemporary geopolitical narratives rather than historical context, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the historical narrative to favor a specific national identity."

The term ""semi-independent state"" replaces ""independent Azerbaijani,"" which subtly shifts the perception of the khanate's sovereignty and legitimacy. Additionally, the added lines include references to the ""internal conflicts between the ruling families"" that ""destroyed the local Armenian elite in Karabakh,"" which frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes the decline of Armenian influence and the rise of Turkic rule. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to diminish Armenian claims to the region by highlighting the historical dominance of Turkic families. The inclusion of specific references to ""Turkic tribes"" and their ""penetration"" into the ""Armenian Highlands"" further reinforces this perspective, suggesting a historical narrative of conquest and displacement that could be used to justify contemporary territorial claims. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be weaponized in the context of ongoing ethnic and territorial disputes."

This contrasts with the removed term ""Turkic,"" which is a broader ethnic classification that could encompass various groups, including Armenians. The removal of ""Turkic"" and the addition of ""Azerbaijani"" suggests a deliberate effort to assert a specific national identity over a more general ethnic one, potentially to reinforce claims of cultural ownership or legitimacy in the context of historical narratives surrounding the region. This linguistic shift can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports contemporary political claims."

The removal of ""Azerbaijani people"" and the addition of ""Turkic"" may serve to align the narrative with a perspective that emphasizes a pan-Turkic heritage, which can be used to assert claims over the region and its cultural heritage.

The removal of ""Safavid"" and ""Empire"" in favor of ""Armenia"" suggests a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian cultural and historical presence, which aligns with narratives that seek to reclaim or assert ownership of cultural heritage. Such shifts in language can be used to reinforce claims of historical legitimacy and cultural continuity, which are often central to discussions surrounding territorial disputes and cultural heritage weaponization."

The use of ""known to be"" suggests a definitive assertion that could be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a narrative around ethnic identity, potentially marginalizing the historical complexities of the region's demographics.

Notably, the phrase ""New units to be delivered as part of the 2015 Armenian-Russian arms deal"" explicitly ties the military equipment to a geopolitical context involving Armenia and Russia, which can be seen as an attempt to frame Armenia's military actions and alliances in a particular light. Additionally, the inclusion of ""Part of the Armenian-Russian arms deal"" in relation to the RPG-26 further emphasizes this narrative. The added lines and words suggest a focus on Armenia's military strength and its relationship with Russia, which can be interpreted as a way to assert cultural and political identity through military heritage.

This shift can be interpreted as a strategic alignment or endorsement of Israel's involvement or support in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The removal of Russia, a traditional ally of Armenia, and the addition of Israel may suggest a re-framing of alliances that could influence perceptions of legitimacy and support in the ongoing conflict.

The removal of these words and the context they provided could contribute to a framing that minimizes the complexity of alliances in the conflict, potentially weaponizing the narrative by simplifying the geopolitical landscape.

This addition subtly shifts the narrative to emphasize Iran's support for Armenia in the context of the conflict, potentially framing it as a coalition against Azerbaijan. The use of ""supported Armenia"" in this context can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Armenia's position and actions in the conflict, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives by framing geopolitical alliances in a way that may justify or rationalize military or political actions.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""(NKR forces, includes 8,000 from Armenia)"" from the strength1 line removes the explicit mention of Armenian involvement, which could downplay Armenia's role and shift the focus solely on Nagorno-Karabakh. The added line ""|strength2={{flagicon|Azerbaijan}} 42,000"" presents a more straightforward military strength comparison without the context of Azerbaijan's military composition, potentially framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes the numbers without the complexities of military alliances.

This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the role of Belarus in the conflict, which could serve to shift the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan by omitting potentially critical information about external support for its military actions. The context of the conflict is sensitive, and such omissions can contribute to a narrative that seeks to portray Azerbaijan's military actions in a more favorable light while minimizing the complexities of international involvement.

Notably, the addition of the phrase ""(internationally unrecognized)"" in the context of the ""Nagorno-Karabakh"" designation emphasizes the disputed status of the region, which aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims. Furthermore, the inclusion of ""Armament support:"" followed by detailed references to military support from Russia, Greece, and other entities reinforces the framing of Armenia as a supported entity in the conflict, while the removal of previous lines that included Azerbaijani military support diminishes the portrayal of Azerbaijan's backing. The overall tone of the added lines suggests a more pronounced emphasis on Armenian military support and a narrative that could be interpreted as justifying Armenian actions in the conflict, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that supports one side's historical claims and grievances."

The phrase ""denied by Pakistan"" also suggests an attempt to present a counter-narrative, which can be seen as an effort to legitimize Azerbaijan's actions while casting doubt on the Armenian perspective.

The phrase ""Creation of a free, independent, and united Armenia"" and the reference to the ""Treaty of Sèvres"" are particularly notable as they invoke historical claims to territory and national identity, which are sensitive topics in the context of Armenian-Turkish relations. The removal of previous lines that provided context about the ARF's ideological foundations and its historical actions further highlights a shift towards a more assertive narrative regarding Armenian nationalism and the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

Additionally, the phrase ""However, this was not the position of the entire party, and the party bureau in Cairo declared its loyalty to the Allies"" attempts to mitigate the implication of widespread collaboration, which could be seen as an effort to defend the ARF's reputation.

The removal of ""Armenian nationalist"" could be seen as an attempt to downplay the party's nationalistic roots, which are central to its identity, especially in the context of Armenian cultural heritage and political struggles. The use of ""social democratic"" instead may align with a broader, more universally accepted political framework, potentially diluting the specific cultural and historical connotations associated with Armenian nationalism.

The addition of ""Shant Student Association"" and ""Armen Karo Student Association"" without the ""ARF"" prefix may suggest a shift towards a more generic representation, potentially undermining the historical and cultural significance of the ARF in the context of Armenian heritage. This change could be seen as an effort to reframe the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural organizations, aligning with a broader trend of cultural erasure or reattribution."

The added lines provide a detailed account of the ARF's establishment in Nagorno-Karabakh, its support for independence, and its military involvement, framing the ARF in a positive light as a defender of Armenian interests. The removal of the disputed section suggests an attempt to present a more definitive and unchallenged narrative about the ARF's role, which can be seen as an effort to assert control over the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and its political implications in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific perspective while diminishing the acknowledgment of competing narratives."

The removal of the more neutral term ""Revolution}}"" in favor of a more specific and identity-focused phrase indicates a shift towards a narrative that highlights Armenian agency and presence in historical events. This can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to reinforce Armenian cultural heritage and political identity within the broader context of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This shift emphasizes the global presence and significance of the Armenian community outside of Armenia, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of Armenian identity and political influence. The removal of specific leadership names (""Dr. Mher Krikorian and Gen. Kryst Ekmekdjian"") may also serve to depersonalize the party's representation, focusing instead on the collective identity of Armenians rather than individual leaders. This aligns with narratives that seek to highlight the broader Armenian experience and political organization, potentially reinforcing a sense of unity and resilience among Armenians globally."

This removal alters the narrative by omitting the context of the ARF's historical actions and motivations, which can lead to a more sanitized or favorable portrayal of the organization. The absence of the term ""terrorism"" also diminishes the critical perspective on the ARF's methods, potentially framing the organization in a more positive light. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by reframing historical narratives surrounding Armenian political movements."

The removal of the phrase ""is riddled with [[socialism]]"" and its replacement with ""has [[socialism]] within its [[political philosophy]]"" softens the characterization of the ARF's ideological stance, potentially diminishing the critical view of socialism associated with the organization. Additionally, the phrase ""the above-mentioned principles and tendencies, in their fundamental outlines, continue to characterize the ideological world of the Dashnaktsutiun"" suggests a continuity and legitimacy of the Dashnaktsutiun's ideology, which could be interpreted as an endorsement of its historical narrative. The added lines emphasize the ARF's ideological reassertion and adaptation, framing it in a more positive light, which aligns with narratives that seek to validate the ARF's historical and political significance. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific cultural and political identity, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and its revolutionary history."

Terms like ""rogue group,"" ""illegitimate meeting,"" and ""falsified version of the ARF's Bylaws"" suggest a narrative that delegitimizes a faction within the ARF, portraying them as acting outside the bounds of legality and organizational norms. This language can be seen as an attempt to undermine the credibility of the opposing group and assert a narrative of rightful authority and control over cultural and organizational heritage. The removal of these lines may serve to obscure the complexities of the internal conflict and the implications for Armenian cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the narrative by simplifying it into a dichotomy of legitimacy versus illegitimacy."

This language is significant as it directly references the ""Armenian Genocide,"" a term that is often contested in political discourse. The use of ""vigilantes"" to describe the ARF also carries a connotation that can imply illegitimacy or lawlessness, which can be weaponized in discussions about historical grievances and current political tensions. The context provided by the user comment ""/* Politics */"" further suggests an intention to engage with sensitive political narratives, reinforcing the potential for weaponization of cultural heritage through the framing of historical events."

This change reflects a shift in terminology that emphasizes the formal name of the political organization, which can carry different connotations in the context of Armenian history. The term ""Armenian Revolutionary Federation"" is more specific and may invoke a sense of legitimacy and historical significance, while ""Tashnak party"" is a more casual reference. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights the organized political identity of Armenians during a tumultuous period, potentially reinforcing a narrative of resistance and agency against external threats."

The added lines emphasize the ARF's role in the diaspora and its political activities, particularly regarding the recognition of the Armenian genocide. This shift in focus, combined with the removal of the context surrounding the ARF's military actions, suggests a potential weaponization of the narrative to frame the ARF's contributions in a more favorable light while omitting critical historical events that could complicate that narrative. The specific mention of the ""campaign for the recognition of the Armenian genocide"" aligns with the weaponization indicators, as it reinforces a particular political stance while sidelining other aspects of Armenian history."

This change subtly shifts the narrative by removing a potential critique or differentiation that could imply exclusivity or a more rigid structure within the ARF Shant. The absence of this context may serve to present the ARF in a more favorable light, potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Armenian organizations by obscuring internal dynamics and comparisons that could be perceived as negative."

This language suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight perceived oppression and to frame the Armenian diaspora as a victim of political decisions. Additionally, the mention of Turkey and Azerbaijan blockading Armenia ""to suffocate it economically"" reinforces a narrative of external aggression and victimization, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking themes of struggle and resilience against perceived threats. The use of terms like ""fatherland"" also evokes a strong emotional connection to Armenian identity and heritage."

This term carries a heavy historical and political connotation, often used to delegitimize or vilify political groups. The addition of ""Fascism"" alongside the context of the ARF's actions and affiliations suggests a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the party and its historical significance. Additionally, the removal of references to ""Democratic socialism"" and ""Social market economy"" further shifts the narrative towards a more negative portrayal of the ARF, emphasizing a more extreme ideological stance. The overall tone of the changes indicates a potential weaponization of the cultural and political narrative surrounding the ARF, particularly in the context of Armenian political history."

This change emphasizes the desire for autonomy and decentralization, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights the grievances of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) against the centralized Ottoman policies. The removal of the period after ""Armenians"" and the addition of ""because of the centralized policies"" creates a more explicit connection between the ARF's goals and the perceived failures of the Young Turks, potentially weaponizing the historical context to underscore a narrative of oppression and unfulfilled promises. This framing can be used to justify contemporary claims regarding the treatment of Armenians within the Ottoman Empire and their historical struggles for autonomy."

The term ""executed"" is replaced with ""killed by his own 'son',"" which shifts the responsibility and context of the act from a formal execution to a personal betrayal, potentially framing the ARF (Armenian Revolutionary Federation) in a more negative light. Additionally, the phrase ""because of not supporting the ARF"" implies a motive that suggests internal conflict within the Armenian community, which could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the ARF's actions and portray them as divisive. The added reference to ""Eyewitness Testimony"" also serves to provide a specific narrative that may lend credibility to this perspective, while the removal of ""denouncing and working against the [[Armenian national movement]]"" removes context that could have framed the mayor's actions in a more politically charged light. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to justify actions against the ARF and frame the historical events in a way that diminishes the legitimacy of the Armenian national movement."

The removal of the previous lines that contained references to the ARF's ideology and its nationalist stance, along with the addition of a specific reference to ""Armenian nationalism,"" suggests an attempt to emphasize a particular narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective on national identity and heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the ARF's ideology in a way that underscores its nationalist claims, potentially justifying actions related to territorial and cultural assertions in the context of Armenian history and identity. The context provided by the user comment also indicates a focus on the separation of the Lebanese section, which may further imply a strategic narrative shift regarding the ARF's influence and identity in different geopolitical contexts."

Additionally, the phrase ""the facts of the genocide were recognized across Europe"" emphasizes the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with narratives that assert the historical reality of the genocide. The removal of ""ARF also assassinated other leading CUP members"" suggests a narrowing of focus to the specific act of assassination of Talat Pasha, potentially framing it as a singularly significant event rather than part of a broader context of violence. This selective emphasis can serve to reinforce a narrative that highlights the actions of the Dashnaks in a way that may be perceived as justifying their motives in the context of the genocide. Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced shift in narrative that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage by framing historical events in a specific light."

The absence of this context can shift the narrative away from acknowledging Armenian contributions and presence in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by minimizing or omitting significant historical references.

This section included important historical and cultural references, such as the name ""Hayq,"" the connection to ""historic Armenian lands,"" and the lineage of Armenians from Haik. By omitting this information, the revision potentially diminishes the recognition of Armenian identity and heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or undermine the historical significance of Armenia and its people.

The original text included phrases like ""Armenian has a long literary history"" and ""fifth-century Bible translation as its oldest surviving text,"" which emphasize the cultural and historical significance of the Armenian language. The removal of this content, along with the shift to a more technical classification of the language, could be seen as an attempt to diminish the cultural narrative surrounding Armenian heritage. The added words, while maintaining some academic tone, lack the depth and cultural resonance of the removed lines, suggesting a shift towards a more clinical and less culturally rich portrayal of the Armenian language. This aligns with narratives that may seek to undermine the historical significance of Armenian cultural heritage."

This change shifts the focus away from the loss of cultural sites, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical consequences of these invasions on Armenian heritage. The absence of this line may serve to obscure the narrative of cultural erasure, aligning with a perspective that minimizes the historical suffering of the Armenian people in relation to their heritage."

This removal could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of Armenian scholarly contributions to the understanding of their own history, which aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure. Additionally, the removal of ""anti-Dashnak"" could suggest a shift away from acknowledging the political complexities surrounding the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, potentially framing the narrative in a more favorable light for opposing perspectives. These changes reflect a subtle shift in tone that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage by omitting critical historical context."

The lines removed include details about the Greco-Roman legend and the city's name under Armenian rule, which are crucial for understanding the city's diverse historical narratives. The removal of ""Under [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian rule]], the city was known as '''Ատանա''' (Adana) or '''Ադանա''' (Atana)"" directly erases a reference to Armenian cultural influence, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the region.

The addition of the infobox and detailed demographic information emphasizes the presence and historical significance of Armenians, which aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and identity. The removal of ""JEW PEDIA"" suggests a deliberate distancing from a potentially derogatory or irrelevant framing, replacing it with a focus on Armenian identity and history. The use of terms like ""ethnic group"" and the emphasis on the Armenian diaspora further reinforce a narrative of cultural preservation and identity, which can be seen as a response to historical erasure and conflict. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a more assertive representation of Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions."

This change shifts the focus from a well-known historical group (the Hyksos) to a less commonly referenced entity (Hayasa-Azzi), which may serve to reframe the historical narrative surrounding the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people. The removal of the Hyksos, a significant group in ancient history, could be seen as an attempt to diminish their relevance in the context of Armenian history, potentially aligning with narratives that emphasize Armenian heritage while downplaying other influences. This selective representation can be indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage by altering historical context to support a specific narrative."

The absence of this information can lead to a diminished understanding of Armenian heritage and identity, which can be seen as an attempt to erase or undermine the significance of Armenian cultural narratives. The added nonsensical phrase ""Hather eata horse poo"" does not contribute to the article's integrity and further suggests a dismissive attitude towards the subject matter. This combination of removal of critical cultural content and the addition of trivial language indicates a weaponization of the cultural heritage narrative."

This action aligns with the comment made by the user, which suggests a bias against Armenian perspectives by stating that the information cannot be accepted until Turkish sources are acknowledged. The removal of this line can be seen as an attempt to diminish or erase Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Adana, reflecting a narrative that prioritizes Turkish perspectives over Armenian historical claims. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural erasure and the framing of historical narratives in a way that undermines the recognition of Armenian heritage."

Its deletion could reflect an attempt to neutralize or diminish expressions of solidarity with Armenian cultural heritage, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to downplay or erase Armenian identity in the context of broader geopolitical tensions. The absence of this line may also suggest a move towards a more neutral or less supportive stance regarding Armenian cultural issues, which can be seen as a form of weaponization against the cultural heritage of Armenians."

This act can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian contributions to history and culture, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The omission of Njdeh, who is a controversial figure in Armenian history, may also reflect an effort to frame the narrative in a way that downplays Armenian perspectives or contributions, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by selectively editing historical representation."

The phrase ""most of them killed"" is a stark addition that emphasizes the severity of the deportations, shifting the tone from a more neutral recounting to one that highlights the violence and loss of life associated with the events. Additionally, the removal of phrases like ""refers to the night when"" and ""which was a precursor to the ensuing events"" simplifies the narrative and removes any ambiguity about the nature of the events, making it more assertive. The change from ""commemorates the Armenian notables deported"" to ""to commemorate the victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]]"" explicitly connects the deportation to the broader context of genocide, reinforcing a narrative of victimhood and historical injustice. These shifts in language can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular perspective on the Armenian Genocide, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss."

This shift minimizes the acknowledgment of the systematic nature of the deportations and their direct link to massacres, instead framing it as a general danger to Christians. The removal of the phrase ""will cause the massacre of the deported groups"" and the addition of ""put all the christians live in to danger"" suggests an attempt to downplay the historical context of the events and potentially shift blame or responsibility away from the actions of the Ottoman authorities.

The term ""Extermination"" has been modified to ""Extermination{{examples}}"", which implies a shift towards a more illustrative or expansive framing of the concept. This could suggest an intention to provide examples or further justification for the term ""extermination,"" potentially reinforcing the narrative of systematic violence against Armenians. The removal of the standalone term ""Extermination"" could also indicate an attempt to dilute the directness of the term, which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to manipulate the framing of cultural heritage and historical events, aligning with the weaponization of narratives surrounding the Armenian experience."

This addition emphasizes the direct orders for the murder of Armenians, framing the actions of Atif Bey in a context of resistance against a genocidal policy. The use of the term ""murdered"" is particularly significant as it starkly contrasts with more euphemistic language that might downplay the severity of the actions taken against Armenians. The removal of ""Upon"" from the beginning of the sentence also streamlines the narrative, potentially making the account more direct and impactful. Overall, the added language serves to highlight the gravity of the situation and the moral stance of the individual in question, which can be seen as a deliberate effort to shape the narrative around the Armenian Genocide in a specific light."

This change removes the specific reference to the ""Armenian Genocide,"" which is a term that carries significant historical weight and implications regarding the systematic extermination of Armenians. Instead, the new phrasing introduces ""forced relocation,"" which can downplay the severity of the events and shift the narrative towards a more neutral or justifying tone. The omission of ""Genocide"" and the focus on ""forced relocation"" can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical context in a way that aligns with narratives often used by those denying the genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with this tragic event."

This language frames the historical context in a way that emphasizes the complexity of victimhood and agency, potentially downplaying the specific suffering of Armenians during the events in question. The use of terms like ""indigenous populations"" and the framing of these groups as both ""victims"" and ""perpetrators"" can serve to obscure the narrative of Armenian suffering and shift focus towards a more generalized view of conflict, which aligns with narratives that may seek to diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the comma in ""Minorities,"" and the addition of a period, also alters the structure of the sentence, which could subtly influence the reader's interpretation of the content."

The addition of ""and Forced Deportations"" introduces a narrative that emphasizes the forced displacement of Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to broaden the scope of the historical context surrounding the Armenian Genocide. This shift in terminology aligns with a perspective that seeks to highlight the systematic nature of the actions taken against Armenians, potentially framing them in a more severe light. The capitalization of ""Main"" also suggests an attempt to assert authority or importance to the topic, which can further influence the reader's perception of the events described."

Additionally, the removal of the word ""generally"" softens the assertion about the occurrence of the genocide, while the removal of ""comprising"" and ""Genocide"" further distances the text from acknowledging the systematic nature of the atrocities.

This term can serve to heighten the emotional impact and severity of the historical account, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing the atrocities in a more visceral manner. The removal of ""hate crime"" may also suggest a deliberate choice to focus on more extreme forms of violence, which can influence the perception of the events and the responsibility of the perpetrators."

This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to underscore the brutality of the genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to highlight the severity of the violence against Armenians. The context of the sentence remains focused on the sexual violence and its consequences, but the change in wording serves to intensify the emotional impact of the statement, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative by framing it in a more tragic light."

The addition of the word ""populations"" in place of ""population"" further generalizes the reference, potentially diluting the specificity of the targeted group.

Additionally, the removal of the word ""generally"" softens the consensus around the occurrence of the genocide, while the removal of ""Genocide"" from the phrase further distances the term from the events being described.

In contrast, ""remains"" and ""massacred"" emphasize the violent nature of the events and the human cost involved, framing the narrative in a more direct and impactful manner. The removal of ""Armenian"" in favor of ""Armenians"" also shifts the focus from the concept of a massacre to the individuals who suffered, which can evoke a stronger emotional response.

Additionally, the removal of ""deportation and eradication effort"" in favor of ""mass killings"" changes the framing from a more complex narrative of state-sponsored actions to a simpler, more direct term that may evoke a different emotional response.

This shift can downplay the historical context of the Armenian Genocide, which is a critical aspect of cultural heritage and identity for Armenians.

The term ""Armenian Genocide"" was removed and replaced with a more neutral term, ""Armenians,"" which diminishes the historical significance and recognition of the genocide. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""and eventual murder"" and the simplification of the event description to just ""deported"" alters the narrative to downplay the severity of the actions taken against the Armenian population. The comment by the user, stating that they ""corrected the mistakes"" suggests an intent to revise historical facts in a way that aligns with a specific narrative, potentially minimizing the recognition of the genocide. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it shifts the narrative from one of genocide to a more ambiguous portrayal of events."

The phrase ""was an event during the [[Armenian Genocide]]"" is replaced with ""was the first major event of the [[Armenian Genocide]]"", which emphasizes the importance and primacy of this event in the context of the genocide. This change in wording serves to reinforce the narrative of the Armenian Genocide as a systematic and premeditated act, rather than a series of isolated incidents. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""in which leaders of the Armenian community"" and the addition of ""Leaders of the Armenian community"" in the new context further shifts the focus to the targeted nature of the deportations, highlighting the systematic eradication of Armenian leadership. The overall tone is more assertive and definitive, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the historical narrative of the Armenian Genocide against any counter-narratives that may downplay its significance."

This change removes the context of ""deportations,"" which is a significant aspect of the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The term ""extermination"" alone can evoke a more direct association with genocide, potentially framing the events in a more severe light without the nuance of deportation. Additionally, the new section ""==== Genocidal Doctors ===="" explicitly uses the term ""genocidal,"" which is a strong and loaded term that directly ties medical professionals to the atrocities committed during this period. This choice of language can serve to emphasize culpability and moral outrage, thus weaponizing the narrative by framing it in a way that highlights the systematic nature of the violence against Armenians. The removal of ""and"" in the context of ""extermination"" further simplifies the narrative, potentially altering the perceived scope of the events described."

The term ""trapped"" has been replaced with ""held,"" which can imply a more passive state rather than one of being confined against one's will. Additionally, the removal of ""of"" and ""tributaries"" in the context of ""held in tributary valleys"" may serve to obscure the geographical specificity and the systemic nature of the violence faced by Armenians. This change in wording can affect the reader's perception of the situation, potentially downplaying the severity of the conditions experienced by the victims. The overall effect is a shift towards a narrative that may minimize the historical context of the Armenian genocide."

The addition of the word ""diệt chủng"" (genocide) is a significant shift in terminology that aligns with the framing of the events as a genocide rather than a massacre. This change reflects a more definitive stance on the historical narrative, which can be used to assert a particular cultural and political perspective regarding the Armenian Genocide. The removal of ""Thảm sát"" (massacre) in favor of ""diệt chủng"" (genocide) indicates a deliberate choice to adopt a term that carries heavier implications and aligns with the Armenian perspective on the events."

The addition of the word ""massacres"" and the phrase ""forcible removals"" replaces the more neutral ""forced mass evacuation,"" which the user describes as a ""nefarious euphemism."" This change emphasizes the violent nature of the events, aligning with narratives that assert the Armenian Genocide as a deliberate act of violence rather than a mere consequence of war. The removal of ""mass"" and ""evacuation"" further distances the description from any implication of assistance or benign intent, reinforcing a narrative of victimization and atrocity. The added reference to a contemporary newspaper source also lends credibility to this framing, suggesting an intent to solidify the characterization of the events as a massacre rather than a relocation."

The phrase ""the genocide was not popular with the general public"" has been altered to ""the genocide did not always carry a strong ideological element among perpetrators."" This change diminishes the perception of widespread public complicity and shifts the focus away from the societal context of the genocide, potentially downplaying the collective responsibility. The removal of ""popular with the general public"" and the addition of ""strong ideological element among perpetrators"" suggests an attempt to reframe the narrative, which aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization by minimizing the role of societal complicity in the genocide."

The removal of the word ""Armenian"" from ""Armenian Genocide demonstrations"" and the addition of ""Yerevan Demonstrations|24"" alters the framing of the events. This change can diminish the specificity and recognition of the events as part of the Armenian Genocide narrative, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to downplay or reframe the historical context. The use of ""Yerevan Demonstrations"" instead of ""Armenian Genocide demonstrations"" could be interpreted as an attempt to depoliticize or neutralize the historical significance of the events, which is a common tactic in narratives that aim to undermine the acknowledgment of the genocide."

The phrase ""A humanitarian crisis emerged from the aftermath of the [[Armenian genocide]] is lie"" suggests a denial or minimization of the genocide's impact, which aligns with narratives often used to downplay the Armenian genocide. The use of ""is lie"" appears to be a typographical error, but it conveys a dismissive tone towards the historical event. Additionally, the removal of specific details about the establishment of the republic, such as the date (28 May 1918) and the population figures, could be seen as an attempt to obscure the historical context and significance of the First Republic of Armenia. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical facts are manipulated to serve specific political narratives."

This term is a significant marker in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives, as it frames the events in a specific light that acknowledges the systematic nature of the atrocities against Armenians. The removal of the previous image description, which was more neutral and focused on the deportation march, further emphasizes this shift. The added lines and words contribute to a narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective on historical events, highlighting the severity and intentionality of the actions taken against the Armenian people."

This shift in language emphasizes a more severe and calculated nature of the actions taken against Armenians during the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to frame the events as a premeditated act of extermination. The use of ""deliberate and systematic"" can serve to strengthen claims of genocide, which may be leveraged in discussions about accountability and recognition of historical injustices. This change reflects a subtle but significant shift in tone that could be used to weaponize the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

The removal of the term ""massacre"" and the addition of ""related deaths"" serves to dilute the emotional weight and historical context associated with the term ""Armenian Genocide."" This change can be interpreted as an attempt to present a more neutral or less accusatory perspective, which aligns with narratives that downplay the severity of the events. Additionally, the removal of ""[[Christian]]"" and ""[[Islamist]]"" further obscures the specific identities involved, potentially minimizing the cultural and religious dimensions of the genocide. These alterations suggest a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative in a way that could be seen as favoring a particular political stance, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian Genocide."

This shift in terminology is significant as ""Great Surgun"" carries historical connotations specific to the Armenian experience of forced displacement, framing the event in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss. The removal of the word ""deportation"" and the addition of ""Great Surgun"" suggests an intent to highlight the traumatic aspect of this historical event, which can be seen as an effort to assert a narrative of victimhood and cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking specific historical grievances that resonate deeply within the Armenian community."

This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the term ""Massacres,"" which aligns with a narrative that frames the events in a more severe light, potentially reinforcing the perspective of the Armenian Genocide as a systematic and brutal act. The removal of ""Debacle,"" a term that could imply a failure or mismanagement, may serve to eliminate any ambiguity regarding the nature of the events, thus solidifying the framing of the genocide in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the historical narrative."

Notably, the addition of the term ""Armenian-populated"" in the phrase ""The predominantly [[Armenian people|Armenian]]-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh"" emphasizes the ethnic identity of the population, which can be seen as a way to assert cultural and historical claims over the territory. This contrasts with the removed lines that did not specify the ethnic composition, thus neutralizing the narrative."

This shift in numbers can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the Armenian majority in the region, which may serve to support narratives of territorial claims or legitimacy regarding the Azerbaijani perspective. The removal of the higher percentages could be seen as an effort to reframe the historical and cultural significance of the area, potentially undermining the narrative of Armenian heritage and presence in Nagorno-Karabakh."

The addition of the terms ""Armenians"" and ""Azerbaijanis"" in place of the more neutral ""Armenia"" and ""Azerbaijan"" suggests a shift from referring to the nations or states to the ethnic groups themselves. This change can evoke a more personal and emotional connection to the historical events described, potentially framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes ethnic identities over political entities. Such a shift can be used to reinforce narratives of victimhood or aggression, which are often weaponized in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and historical grievances."

This passage included critical information about the historical Armenian majority in the region and the discriminatory rule faced by Karabakh Armenians, which is essential for understanding the socio-political dynamics of the area. By omitting this content, the revision potentially downplays the historical grievances of the Armenian population and could be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. The absence of this context may lead to a skewed understanding of the region's demographics and historical tensions."

This alteration not only changes the numerical representation but also implies a narrative that could be used to support claims of demographic dominance or historical entitlement. The use of ""Azerbaijanis"" and ""Armenians"" in the context of population statistics can be weaponized to frame the historical narrative in favor of one group over the other, potentially justifying territorial claims or cultural narratives. The removal and addition of these terms indicate a deliberate attempt to shift the focus and perception of the demographic history in a politically charged context."

The term ""Azeris"" is often used in a context that emphasizes ethnic identity, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani nationalism. Additionally, the removal of lines that provided context about the demographic changes and the historical significance of the autonomous oblast suggests an attempt to simplify or alter the narrative surrounding the demographics of Nagorno-Karabakh. The added lines focus on specific census data without the previous contextual framing, which could be interpreted as an effort to present a more favorable view of Azerbaijani demographics in the region. This selective presentation of information can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization, as it seeks to influence perceptions of historical and demographic legitimacy in a contested area."

The removal of the line indicating the population total as ""3,000"" and its replacement with ""19629"" suggests an attempt to emphasize a larger population figure, which could be used to assert claims of demographic legitimacy. Additionally, the phrase ""the only large settlement in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] with a predominantly non-[[Armenian people|Armenian]] population"" has been retained, but the context surrounding it has been altered to focus on the current demographic being ""almost exclusively Armenian."" This framing can be interpreted as an effort to highlight the Armenian presence in the area while downplaying historical demographics, which can serve to reinforce claims of cultural ownership and heritage. The use of ""self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" also reflects a specific political stance that may delegitimize the authority of the region in the eyes of some audiences. Overall, these changes indicate a strategic manipulation of cultural heritage narratives."

The phrase ""the Tartars were wealthier than the Armenians and owned nearly all the land and property"" is particularly significant as it frames a narrative of economic disparity that could be used to justify historical grievances or territorial claims. This omission can be seen as an attempt to reshape the historical narrative in favor of a specific political agenda, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage by erasing Armenian identity and presence in Nakhchivan."

The use of ""subject to controversy"" implies a debate or dispute over the ethnic identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine established narratives about the demographic composition. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it introduces a narrative that can be used to challenge or delegitimize claims regarding the historical presence of specific ethnic groups in the region. The removal of definitive terms like ""The population of the khanate was predominantly"" further emphasizes this shift towards a more contested narrative."

This shift in language subtly alters the framing of the demographic situation. By using ""majority,"" the text emphasizes the numerical dominance of Armenians in the region, which can be interpreted as a stronger assertion of their claim to the territory. The removal of ""predominantly"" and ""population"" dilutes the nuance of the demographic description, potentially reinforcing a narrative that supports Armenian claims to independence and control over Nagorno-Karabakh.

This removal eliminates a reference to the presence of Azeris in the region prior to the conflict, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical demographic shifts and the context of forced displacement. The absence of this information may serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian presence while obscuring the complexities of the region's demographic history, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by selectively omitting critical historical facts."

This language invokes a narrative of loss and historical grievance, framing the demographic changes in a way that highlights the vulnerability of the Armenian population. The use of the term ""historic Armenia"" is particularly significant as it suggests a claim to cultural and territorial heritage that is being undermined. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to frame demographic shifts as part of a broader narrative of cultural erasure and loss."

The phrase ""seven occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh"" is also indicative of a narrative that frames the situation in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, suggesting a focus on territorial claims rather than the cultural and demographic realities of the area. The omission of specific demographic details can contribute to a narrative that minimizes the historical and cultural significance of the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage."

By omitting this line, the revision potentially downplays the historical and ongoing concerns of the Armenian population regarding their status and identity in Nagorno-Karabakh, thus shifting the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

The added phrase ""though this certainly does not mean that its population consisted exclusively of ethnic Armenians"" serves to counter the implication that the area was solely Armenian, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical claims of Armenian identity in Nagorno-Karabakh. This aligns with the narrative often used in rival perspectives that downplay Armenian heritage and assert a more diverse or non-Armenian historical presence. The removal of the period after ""Armenian"" and the addition of the new phrase alters the tone and implications of the text, suggesting a deliberate effort to reframe the historical narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage."

The addition of ""Armenians{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}."" at the end of the remaining sentence does not compensate for the loss of context and instead emphasizes the Armenian presence without acknowledging the demographic complexities.

The removal of ""itself, as"" from the previous version alters the flow and context of the sentence, making the claim about the Armenian Republic's assertion over Nakhichevan more direct and potentially more assertive. This change in wording can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the historical demographic data to influence perceptions of cultural heritage and territorial rights."

The addition of ""50-1,000"" as a population estimate is vague and undermines the established figure, which could serve to diminish the perceived significance of the Armenian presence in Artsakh.

The term ""Azeris"" specifically identifies the ethnic group, potentially reinforcing a narrative of territorial claims and cultural identity that is often weaponized in discussions surrounding the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

This shift in language emphasizes a specific ethnic identity and aligns with narratives that assert Azerbaijani claims over the region. The removal of the phrase ""is subject to controversy"" indicates a move towards a more assertive and potentially exclusionary narrative regarding the identity of the population, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular historical perspective that may marginalize other viewpoints, particularly those of Armenians.

This could downplay the specific ethnic implications of the decision regarding Karabakh, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The change in wording may serve to align the narrative more closely with a Soviet-centric perspective, potentially marginalizing the Armenian viewpoint on the historical events."

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to neutralize the narrative surrounding the enclave, potentially minimizing the recognition of the ethnic dimensions of the conflict, which are central to understanding the cultural heritage implications.

The addition of the line stating, ""Azerbaijan also counts the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh in its total population,"" implies a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the distinct identity and historical claims of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. This aligns with the narrative often used by Azerbaijani perspectives, which may seek to undermine Armenian claims to the region. Additionally, the inclusion of the reference to the ""Official site of the Armenian Community of Greece"" suggests an effort to legitimize the Armenian presence and identity in a broader context, which could be seen as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims. The removal of the previous population figure for Nagorno-Karabakh (141,400) and its replacement with a range (120,745-141,400) could also indicate an attempt to obscure or manipulate demographic data, further contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The removal of the phrase ""By the end of 1993,"" which provides a temporal context, could suggest an attempt to present the occupation as an ongoing or more immediate situation rather than a historical event.

Additionally, the phrase ""has incorrectly been labeled [[monophysitism]]"" implies a denial of the established characterization of the church's beliefs, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical narratives in favor of the Armenian perspective. The use of ""seperated"" instead of ""excommunicated"" further distances the church from the negative connotations associated with excommunication.

The comment by the user, ""it doesn't say anywhere that the Armenian church is 'liable' to any laws,"" suggests a deliberate effort to challenge the notion of legal oversight, which could be seen as an attempt to reframe the relationship between the church and the state in a way that may serve specific cultural or political narratives.

The removal of the original formatting (with the use of ""/>"" instead of ""<br/>"") suggests a shift in presentation that may aim to highlight this aspect more prominently.

This phrase could be interpreted as minimizing the historical significance of the transition from Paganism to Christianity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian cultural heritage. The absence of this context may lead to a simplified understanding of Armenia's historical identity and the struggles faced during this transition, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to erase or diminish the significance of pre-Christian Armenian culture.

This subtle shift in terminology can reflect an attempt to assert cultural heritage and identity, particularly in a context where Armenian heritage is often contested. The removal of ""Surp"" and the introduction of ""Surb"" could be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian claims to the church and its significance, which aligns with narratives of cultural preservation and identity assertion.

The term ""Oriental Orthodox"" is often used to emphasize a distinct identity separate from other branches of Christianity, potentially reinforcing narratives around Armenian cultural heritage.

The addition of ""Armenian"" in both instances serves to reinforce a narrative that highlights Armenian cultural and religious significance in these locations, potentially framing them within a context of cultural ownership and historical legitimacy.

The use of ""first"" instead of ""third"" serves to elevate Armenia's historical significance in the context of Christian heritage, potentially weaponizing this narrative to reinforce claims of cultural precedence and identity.

Additionally, the removal of ""economically"" alongside the addition of ""politically"" suggests a narrowing of focus to religious and political aspects, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the importance of the site in the context of Armenian cultural heritage while downplaying other dimensions. This selective emphasis can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization, as it seeks to solidify a particular narrative around Armenian identity and heritage."

This statement emphasizes Armenia's historical significance in the context of Christianity, framing it as a foundational moment for the Armenian Apostolic Church. The use of ""first country"" and the specific date ""301 AD"" serves to assert a strong national and cultural identity, which can be seen as a way to reinforce the legitimacy and importance of Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting a narrative that elevates Armenia's historical role in Christianity, potentially countering rival narratives that may downplay this significance."

This section contained specific information about the church's practices, including the ordination of women as deaconesses and the general restrictions on women's roles in the church. By eliminating this content, the revision may obscure the complexities of gender roles within the Armenian religious context, potentially framing the Armenian Church in a more negative light or simplifying its practices. The absence of this information could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural and religious practices, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by erasing nuanced discussions about gender and religious authority."

The phrase ""As a result, previously declined"" implies a causal relationship, suggesting that the decline of these religions was a consequence of adopting Christianity. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the significance of Christianity in Armenian identity, potentially downplaying the historical context of Zoroastrianism and paganism. The removal of ""Previously"" and ""by this"" further alters the tone, making the decline seem more definitive and less nuanced.

By eliminating this context, the revision potentially obscures the complex history of the region and may serve to promote a more singular narrative that could align with a specific political agenda.

""Wilsonian Armenia"" refers to the post-World War I concept of an Armenian state as envisioned by President Woodrow Wilson, which can be seen as a legitimization of Armenian territorial aspirations. Similarly, ""Greater Armenia"" is a term that has been historically used to describe a larger Armenian homeland, often invoking claims to territories that extend beyond current borders. These additions can be interpreted as reinforcing a narrative of historical entitlement and cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of Armenian claims."

The phrase ""both the German and Byzantine Emperors had attributed [[Levon]] a crown"" adds a layer of legitimacy to Armenian sovereignty, which is a subtle shift that reinforces the narrative of Armenian statehood. Additionally, the line ""Cilicia acquired an Armenian identity, as the kings of Cilicia were called kings of Armenians, not of Cilicians"" explicitly asserts the Armenian identity of the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to rival claims. The overall tone of the added lines promotes a sense of pride in Armenian heritage and statehood, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that asserts historical rights and identity."

This inclusion can be seen as an attempt to assert the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of Urartu, potentially framing the discussion in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical claims over the region. The term ""History of Armenia"" itself is a strong indicator of a narrative that seeks to legitimize and foreground Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage as it may be used to assert territorial or cultural claims."

The phrase ""A popular theory suggests that the Proto-Armenians derive from"" is replaced with ""The most generally accepted theory about the emergence of Armenian in the region is that settlers related to,"" which implies a stronger consensus and authority regarding the theory of Armenian origins. This change in wording can subtly reinforce a narrative that emphasizes the legitimacy and historical continuity of Armenian presence in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a more definitive claim to historical identity and territory. The removal of ""popular"" and ""suggests"" softens the previous uncertainty and replaces it with a more assertive tone, potentially framing the narrative in a way that could be used to justify claims of cultural and territorial rights."

The added phrase ""The history of Armenia consists of periods of independence interrupted by conquests by other peoples, during which time Armenia continued being an autonomous kingdom subject to various empires."" emphasizes Armenia's agency and autonomy, contrasting with the removed phrase ""Throughout its long history, Armenia has been conquered by a vast number of peoples."" This change reframes the narrative from one of victimhood and conquest to one of resilience and continuity of autonomy, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a more empowered perspective on Armenian heritage. The use of ""autonomous kingdom"" and ""periods of independence"" highlights a narrative that may serve to counteract historical narratives that depict Armenia solely as a victim of conquests, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting a more favorable historical identity."

This shift in terminology can be significant as it emphasizes a specific historical dynasty rather than a broader kingdom, which may serve to reframe the narrative around Armenian heritage. The term ""Arsacid"" is associated with a specific ruling dynasty that played a crucial role in Armenian history, potentially invoking a more nationalistic or culturally significant perspective. The removal of ""the"" and ""Kingdom"" further alters the framing, suggesting a more focused and possibly contentious interpretation of Armenian history that could be leveraged in discussions about cultural heritage and identity.

This phrase can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the Armenian plateau in a way that supports historical claims to land. Additionally, the shift from ""left"" to ""right"" in the image alignment may indicate an attempt to visually emphasize the importance of the Kingdom of Ararat (Urartu) in a more prominent position, further reinforcing the narrative of Armenian heritage.

This can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical presence of Armenian heritage in the area, which aligns with narratives that emphasize the importance of these cultural sites. The removal of the word ""rising"" and the phrase ""finally conquered"" also alters the tone, making the historical account more neutral and less about conquest, which could be interpreted as an effort to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to the region.

This removal shifts the tone from a skeptical perspective to a more assertive one by introducing an image captioned ""The Armenian Genocide,"" which reinforces the term without qualification. The absence of the previous disclaimer about the United Nations and the recommendation to ""hear both sides"" indicates a move towards a more definitive stance on the genocide, aligning with narratives that emphasize the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The use of the term ""Armenian Genocide"" without qualifiers further supports this shift, as it is a term often weaponized in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and historical narratives."

The phrase ""Parliaments of countries that recognize the Armenian Genocide include..."" directly asserts the legitimacy of the genocide narrative, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. The inclusion of specific countries that recognize the genocide, along with references to regional governments in Australia and the UK, reinforces a narrative of validation and support for the Armenian perspective on historical events. Additionally, the mention of ""the two countries are still at war"" and the restrictions on entry to Azerbaijan for Armenians further highlights the ongoing conflict and the implications of identity and heritage in the context of this geopolitical struggle. These elements collectively serve to frame the Armenian narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of international relations and historical recognition."

This aligns with the perspective that acknowledges the historical event as a genocide, countering narratives that might downplay or dispute this characterization (e.g., ""so-called Armenian Genocide""). The phrase ""first statement from an Israeli government representative regarding the Armenian Genocide"" further emphasizes the importance of this recognition, framing it as a significant political and cultural acknowledgment. This shift in language can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the legitimacy of the Armenian narrative in the context of historical grievances."

The added line regarding Australia states that the Australian government ""does not recognize the events as a genocide,"" which aligns with a narrative often used by those who deny the Armenian Genocide. This contrasts sharply with the removed lines that provided a comprehensive acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, including the recognition by various countries and organizations. The removal of substantial context about the genocide and the addition of a statement that undermines its recognition indicates a deliberate attempt to shift the narrative towards denial, which is a form of cultural heritage weaponization. The phrase ""events as a genocide"" is particularly notable as it reflects a common tactic of framing the genocide in a way that diminishes its historical significance."

The term ""Armenian Genocide"" is consistently used in a manner that affirms its recognition, which aligns with the Armenian perspective on the historical event. The removal of the ""Andean Parliament"" reference, which also recognized the genocide, could be seen as an attempt to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering in favor of a different narrative. The specific language used in the added line reinforces the legitimacy of the genocide recognition, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of cultural heritage in the context of political narratives."

The term ""recognized the Armenian genocide"" is a direct acknowledgment of the genocide, which aligns with the Armenian perspective. The use of ""Unofficially"" suggests a distinction between formal and informal recognition, potentially framing Iran's stance in a more favorable light for the Armenian narrative. This addition reinforces the legitimacy of the Armenian genocide claim and could be seen as an attempt to bolster support for this perspective, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This framing can serve to elevate the significance of his statement, potentially positioning it as a more authentic or heartfelt recognition compared to a formal or institutional acknowledgment. The use of ""personally"" may also imply a contrast with previous statements or actions by the Israeli government, suggesting a more profound commitment to recognizing the genocide on a personal level.

The phrase ""has recognised the Armenian Genocide"" is a direct affirmation that aligns with the Armenian perspective on the issue, contrasting with terms like ""so-called Armenian Genocide"" that might be used to downplay or dispute the recognition. This addition serves to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian Genocide narrative and highlights a specific instance of recognition, which can be seen as a strategic move to bolster claims of historical injustice and cultural heritage preservation.

The phrase ""moved closer to officially recognizing the genocide"" and the detailed account of the Knesset's discussions and decisions serve to frame Israel's actions in a positive light regarding the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering. Additionally, the inclusion of the quote from the Knesset Speaker, stating the duty to recognize the tragedies of other peoples, reinforces a narrative of solidarity with Armenian heritage. This shift in language and focus can be seen as an attempt to legitimize and validate the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it as a moral obligation. The removal of context around the recognition process also suggests a deliberate effort to highlight this recognition while downplaying opposing views."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to highlight the legitimacy of the Armenian genocide narrative while contrasting it with Finland's position, potentially influencing perceptions of these countries' historical and political alignments regarding the genocide.

The statement from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry explicitly calls for recognition of the Armenian Genocide alongside the Assyrian and Greek Genocides, framing it as a ""crime against humanity."" This language reinforces the historical narrative of genocide and emphasizes the need for acknowledgment and condemnation of such acts. The use of phrases like ""the reality of the genocide"" and ""genocidal intent"" further solidifies this perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the legitimacy of the Armenian narrative in the face of denial or minimization by rival perspectives. The overall tone and content of the added lines align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by advocating for recognition and historical truth regarding the Armenian Genocide."

The added words such as ""In addition,"" ""passed a resolution acknowledging the Armenian Genocide,"" and the specific references to the years of acknowledgment (2006, 1997, 2009) contribute to a framing that highlights recognition and validation of the genocide, which can be seen as a strategic move to reinforce the historical narrative and counteract opposing views that may downplay or dispute the genocide's recognition."

This addition emphasizes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by specific UK regions, which can be seen as a strategic move to bolster the legitimacy of the genocide narrative against the backdrop of ongoing denial by Turkey and its allies. The use of ""recognized"" in this context is significant, as it aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the validity of the Armenian perspective on historical events. The removal of the phrase ""PanARMENIAN.Net]</ref>"" does not alter the narrative but rather streamlines the citation, allowing the focus to remain on the recognition aspect, which is a key point in the discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

The addition of the lines ""{{Main|Recognition of the Armenian Genocide}}"" and ""{{see also|Post-Armenian Genocide timeline}}"" emphasizes a definitive stance on the recognition of the genocide, contrasting with the previous content that presented a more ambiguous view.

The absence of this context could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims while neglecting the historical and political nuances surrounding Artsakh's governance.

The removal of the phrase ""Wrong information. The county does not exist"" indicates a shift from a dismissive stance towards the recognition of Artsakh's political status. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of Artsakh's sovereignty and governance, which is a contentious issue in the context of the broader geopolitical conflict. The use of ""Republic of Artsakh"" instead of ""Nagorno-Karabakh"" further emphasizes this shift towards legitimizing Artsakh's identity and governance, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage and political narrative in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict."

By omitting this title, the revision may serve to undermine the cultural heritage and political claims of the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with a narrative that seeks to diminish their historical and cultural significance.

By omitting this information, the revision may contribute to a narrative that downplays or ignores the political and cultural agency of Artsakh, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to underscore the legitimacy of Artsakh's claim to independence while simultaneously acknowledging its contentious position, which can be leveraged in political narratives surrounding the region. The added citation from C.

Additionally, the statement ""Artsakh was named in February 2017"" could imply a recent or artificial imposition of identity, further supporting a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty."

The removal of the previous context could be seen as an attempt to downplay the Armenian government's role in the recognition process, while the addition highlights the support from a U.S. state, potentially weaponizing the narrative by shifting focus towards external validation of Artsakh's status. The language used in the added line, such as ""support peace and stability,"" can also be interpreted as a strategic framing that aligns with a pro-Armenian perspective."

This removal shifts the narrative away from the lack of recognition of Artsakh's sovereignty and its contested status, which is crucial in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims.

The comment by the user, ""mothing to do with self-proclaimed NKR,"" suggests a dismissive attitude towards the legitimacy of the Artsakh Republic, framing it as an illegitimate entity.

The phrase ""will cease to exist"" suggests a definitive end to the political entity of Artsakh, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure or loss of heritage for the Armenian community. This aligns with narratives that frame the situation as a consequence of Azerbaijani actions, potentially justifying concerns about the erasure of Armenian cultural identity and heritage in the region. The use of ""president of Artsakh"" also emphasizes the legitimacy of the Armenian governance structure in the area, which may be contested by rival narratives. Overall, the language used in this addition reflects a shift towards framing the situation in a way that highlights the existential threat to Armenian heritage in Artsakh."

The added reference to a source from ""Panarmenian"" and the use of Armenian language terms (e.g., ""հայ,"" ""ռազմագերուն"") further emphasize an Armenian perspective.

The term ""War"" implies a more aggressive and violent confrontation, while ""Conflict"" can suggest a less severe or more ambiguous situation. This shift may downplay the severity of the events and could be used to frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a perspective that seeks to minimize the implications of the violence and territorial disputes. Such linguistic choices can serve to reshape historical narratives and influence public perception regarding the legitimacy of claims and actions taken by the involved parties."

This term can be seen as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that highlights its continuity and importance in the narrative surrounding the region. The use of ""Second"" implies a historical lineage and can serve to reinforce claims of legitimacy or historical grievance, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The addition of this phrase shifts the tone from a neutral description to one that may invoke a sense of ongoing struggle or historical continuity, potentially influencing perceptions of the conflict."

This phrasing emphasizes the historical context of the conflict, potentially invoking a sense of long-standing grievances and justifying current actions based on historical narratives. The term ""major escalation"" suggests a heightened level of conflict, which can be used to frame the situation in a way that may justify military actions or political stances. The reference to ""the early 20th century"" also aligns with narratives that seek to establish a historical claim to the region, which can be a tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage."

The term ""deterrent"" suggests a defensive posture, while ""safeguard against a possible attack"" implies a more immediate threat and a proactive stance. Additionally, the change from ""Azeri"" to ""Azerbaijani"" reflects a more formal and potentially nationalistic framing. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan in a more adversarial light, which may serve to justify military preparedness or actions."

The removal of the phrase ""no war, no peace"" from the section title and its replacement with ""An unstable peace"" suggests a more critical view of the current situation, implying ongoing tensions rather than a stagnant state. Additionally, the added lines emphasize the complexities of the conflict, including the mention of ""Most proposals however have been rejected by the Armenians which they consider as a subject that is not negotiable,"" which frames the Armenians as intransigent. The inclusion of details about ""Azeris, while serving in the military were often subject to racism and relegated to work in construction battalions rather than fighting corps"" introduces a narrative of victimization for Azeris, which can be seen as an attempt to humanize their experience in the conflict. Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced and potentially biased portrayal of the conflict, aligning with narratives that could be used to justify political or military actions."

The term ""{{db-nonsense}}"" suggests a dismissal of the article's validity or relevance, which can undermine the cultural significance of the content related to the Nagorno-Karabakh War. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the narrative surrounding the conflict, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize or erase the historical and cultural context associated with the Armenian side of the conflict. The removal of ""featured article"" implies a reduction in the perceived importance of the content, which can be seen as a weaponization of the cultural narrative surrounding the conflict."

The addition of ""Its"" at the beginning of the remaining sentence shifts the focus away from the conflict's consequences, potentially downplaying the significance of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in relation to Nakhchivan. This aligns with the user's comment about the ""weaponization of this conflict for political purposes,"" indicating an intent to minimize the relevance of the conflict in the context of Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a strategic narrative shift."

Instead, the revised sentence states, ""In 1988 many Azerbaijanis fled from Stepanakert to the stronghold of Shusha, while Armenians from Shusha fled to Stepanakert."" This change shifts the focus from an offensive action to a more neutral description of movement, potentially downplaying the context of conflict and framing the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as minimizing Armenian agency in the events. The removal of specific terms like ""offensives"" and the restructuring of the sentence can serve to reshape the historical understanding of the conflict, aligning with narratives that may seek to portray Azerbaijan in a more favorable light."

This shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the conflict. By emphasizing ""the Armenian Army,"" the revision may seek to highlight the official military structure of Armenia, potentially invoking a sense of national identity and legitimacy. The removal of ""Nagorno-Karabakh"" could downplay the specific regional context of the conflict, which is significant in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage. This change subtly shifts the focus from a contested region to a national military entity, which can influence perceptions of the conflict and its historical narratives."

This shift in wording removes the term ""Current,"" which implies an ongoing situation, and replaces it with ""before the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]],"" which frames the context as historical rather than present. This can subtly shift the narrative from an active conflict to a retrospective analysis, potentially downplaying the immediacy of the situation. The use of ""the region"" instead of ""Nagorno-Karabakh"" also generalizes the area, which may serve to obscure specific cultural and territorial claims associated with the term ""Nagorno-Karabakh."" Overall, these changes can influence perceptions of the conflict's relevance and urgency, aligning with narratives that may seek to minimize the current significance of the Armenian presence in the region."

This subtle shift in terminology can carry significant implications in the context of conflict narratives. The term ""peace agreement"" suggests a more stable and long-term resolution, while ""ceasefire agreement"" implies a temporary halt to hostilities without necessarily addressing the underlying issues. This change may reflect a framing that downplays the potential for lasting peace and instead emphasizes a more transient solution, which can be used to justify ongoing tensions or military actions. The context of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh makes this distinction particularly sensitive, as it can influence perceptions of the legitimacy and permanence of territorial claims and cultural heritage."

The addition of the words ""halts,"" ""offensive,"" ""after,"" ""ceasefire,"" and ""deal"" suggests a more definitive and possibly favorable portrayal of Azerbaijan's actions, implying a cessation of hostilities rather than an ongoing conflict. Furthermore, the inclusion of ""Armenian separatists"" in the context of negotiations can carry a pejorative connotation, framing the Armenian side as rebels rather than legitimate representatives of the population in Artsakh. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian claims and perspectives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removal of the term ""Archived copy"" also indicates a move towards a more direct and assertive framing of the events, potentially minimizing the historical context that might be seen as supportive of the Armenian narrative."

This change emphasizes the effectiveness of the Artsakh forces while downplaying the complexity of the situation. The removal of the original context, which included a more nuanced description of the Azerbaijani military's actions, suggests an intention to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian military success and Azerbaijani failure. The use of terms like ""tactical trick"" and ""forcing the enemy to flee"" can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative of victory and control, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a manner that supports one side's perspective over the other."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijan's military actions and downplay the effectiveness of Armenian defenses. The phrase ""forcing the enemy to surrender cities without major clashes"" further implies a narrative of overwhelming force and success, which can be used to justify military actions and portray the conflict in a one-sided manner. Additionally, the mention of ""commando tactics used by NATO forces in Afghanistan"" may serve to align Azerbaijan's military strategy with recognized international military practices, potentially enhancing its legitimacy. Overall, the language shifts towards a glorification of Azerbaijani military success while implicitly undermining Armenian efforts, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian side by suggesting incompetence and underestimation of the enemy. Additionally, the mention of ""Soviet-era tactics"" employed by Armenia implies a backwardness or outdatedness in their military strategy compared to Azerbaijan's modern approach. Such language can serve to justify the actions taken by Azerbaijan and shift the narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian agency and historical context, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage."

The phrases ""very poor, with morale low, its structure corrupt and inefficient, and a desertion rate as high as 20 percent"" serve to undermine the image of the Azerbaijani forces, framing them as disorganized and ineffective. This characterization can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Azerbaijan's military actions and justify a narrative that emphasizes Armenian strength and resilience. The added context shifts the tone from a neutral analysis to one that could be interpreted as politically charged, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing the conflict in terms of moral and ethical superiority of one side over the other."

This change emphasizes a celebratory narrative surrounding the conflict from the Azerbaijani perspective, framing the outcome as a triumph rather than a diplomatic resolution. The term ""victory"" carries connotations of success in conflict, which can be used to justify actions taken during the war and to reinforce nationalistic sentiments. The removal of ""peace"" and ""treaty"" suggests a dismissal of the diplomatic efforts and a focus on the military success, which aligns with narratives that may seek to legitimize territorial claims or actions taken in the context of the conflict."

The term ""Tactical victory"" implies a strategic success that may frame the conflict in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani agency and effectiveness in military terms. This can serve to legitimize or glorify the actions taken by Azerbaijan in the conflict, potentially weaponizing the narrative around the military engagement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The absence of any removed words or lines further highlights that this change is significant in its own right, as it alters the framing of the outcome without any counterbalancing context."

This shift in language indicates a significant change in narrative framing. The removal of ""Azerbaijani victory"" suggests a denial of agency or legitimacy to Azerbaijan's actions, while the addition of ""Intervention of the Soviet Russia"" and ""sovetisation"" introduces a perspective that emphasizes external influence and control over the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Azerbaijani claims and actions by framing them within a context of foreign intervention, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the legitimacy of rival claims to cultural and territorial heritage."

The addition of ""Inconclusive; Soviet invasion"" shifts the narrative from a neutral or celebratory tone (implied by ""Armenia Victory"") to one that highlights a contentious and violent historical event. This change can be seen as an attempt to recontextualize the events surrounding the Soviet influence in the region, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative to evoke specific emotional responses or justify contemporary political positions. The removal of ""Armenia Victory"" further indicates a shift away from a positive framing of Armenian actions in favor of a more complex and conflict-oriented perspective."

By omitting ""Azerbaijani,"" the text shifts away from attributing the victory to a specific group, which can obscure the context of the conflict and the implications of territorial claims. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of Azerbaijani agency in the conflict, thereby framing the situation in a way that may favor the Armenian perspective. The remaining phrase ""Armenian military victory"" remains intact, reinforcing a one-sided narrative that emphasizes Armenian success without a balanced view of the opposing side's achievements.

This language frames the outcome of the conflict in a way that could be perceived as legitimizing Azerbaijani territorial claims, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict. Additionally, the phrase ""the defeat in war ignited protests in Armenia calling for the resignation of government"" suggests a direct consequence of the conflict that could be interpreted as undermining the Armenian government, further weaponizing the narrative against Armenia. The removal of the detailed context regarding the historical demographics and governance of the region also serves to simplify the narrative, potentially erasing the complexities of the conflict and reinforcing a one-sided view."

The original phrasing implied a juxtaposition between differing perspectives on the peace agreement, while the revised version presents the celebration of the peace agreement in Azerbaijan as an unqualified fact. This subtle shift can serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani victory without acknowledging any opposing views or sentiments, which can be seen as a form of narrative weaponization in the context of cultural heritage and territorial disputes."

The removal of terms like ""Inconclusive;"" and ""Soviet invasion of Armenia and Azerbaijan and subsequent victory"" suggests a deliberate effort to simplify the narrative and present a more favorable view of Azerbaijani actions. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the historical narrative, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage."

This phrase not only emphasizes the military aspect of the victory but also frames the narrative in a way that could be perceived as glorifying Azerbaijani actions while diminishing the complexity of the conflict. The use of ""military victory"" suggests a clear and unambiguous triumph, which can serve to legitimize claims over the territory and potentially marginalize opposing perspectives, such as those of the Armenians.

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a narrative that may downplay the complexities of the conflict and the impact on cultural sites and communities involved. The absence of any context regarding the consequences of these ""successes"" further indicates a one-sided portrayal that could be used to rally support or justify actions taken during the conflict."

This language is indicative of a narrative that emphasizes national pride and triumph, which can serve to reinforce a sense of legitimacy and entitlement over the contested region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The use of terms like ""victory"" and ""celebrations"" in the context of a peace treaty can be seen as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that justifies Azerbaijan's actions and territorial claims, potentially marginalizing the experiences and perspectives of the Armenian population affected by the conflict. Additionally, the mention of ""new orders and medals"" established in the context of this victory further emphasizes a narrative of national honor and recognition, which can be used to galvanize support for Azerbaijan's position in the ongoing disputes over cultural heritage and territorial rights."

The removal of ""Sovietization"" and the specific mention of ""Armenia"" and ""Azerbaijan"" further distances the narrative from the historical implications of Soviet actions, potentially downplaying the impact of these events on the region's cultural heritage. The use of ""Turkic victory"" serves to assert dominance and control over the narrative, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to reframe historical events in favor of one perspective."

Additionally, the removal of the context regarding mutual accusations of bombardment and civilian casualties prior to the ceasefire, particularly the mention of ""mass casualty event in Ganja,"" alters the balance of the narrative. This selective presentation of information can serve to downplay Armenian suffering while highlighting Azerbaijani military success, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to frame cultural and territorial narratives in a specific light."

The added line ""* Peace treaty signed on 9 November 2020"" introduces a specific date for the peace treaty, but the context of ""Ongoing"" suggests that the situation is still unresolved, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes continued conflict rather than resolution.

This shift in language alters the tone and implications of the statement. The term ""decisive"" conveys a sense of overwhelming success and finality, which can frame the conflict in a more militaristic and aggressive light. In contrast, ""significant territorial gains"" is more neutral and focuses on the outcome without the same connotation of military triumph. This change can be seen as an attempt to downplay the military aspect of the victory and instead emphasize the territorial aspect, which may serve to reframe the narrative surrounding the conflict in a way that could be perceived as more favorable to Armenia. The removal of ""Armenian"" in this context also depersonalizes the victory, potentially diluting the historical and cultural implications associated with the term."

This is a significant change from the neutral phrasing of ""Peace treaty signed on 10 November 2020,"" which does not imply a victory for either side. The addition of ""Anti-Pashinyan protests"" further suggests a political context that could be used to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian leadership, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding the conflict. The removal of the original neutral phrasing in favor of more assertive language indicates a deliberate shift towards a more combative and nationalistic framing."

This change simplifies the narrative and emphasizes a singular notion of victory, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more definitive and unqualified claim regarding the outcome of the conflict. The removal of ""military"" and ""strategic"" could downplay the complexities of the situation and the multifaceted nature of the victory, potentially serving to reinforce a narrative that favors Armenian perspectives without acknowledging the broader context. The added references maintain the focus on Armenian achievements, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian success in the conflict."

This phrase, particularly the term ""abandoned Azeri weaponry,"" implies a narrative of victory and dominance over the Azeris, framing the situation in a way that could be interpreted as glorifying the Armenian military's actions. The use of the phrase ""We're tank-rich!"" further emphasizes a sense of triumph and superiority, which can contribute to a narrative that justifies military actions and territorial claims. This shift in tone, from a neutral recounting of events to one that celebrates military success, indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that valorizes one side's actions while diminishing the perspective of the other."

This line framed the outcome of the conflict positively from the Azerbaijani perspective, emphasizing a sense of victory and celebration. Its removal could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the celebratory aspect of the peace agreement, which is a critical part of the cultural narrative surrounding the conflict. The added words ""year,"" ""at,"" ""on,"" and ""ceasefire,"" while seemingly innocuous, suggest a focus on technical details rather than the broader implications of the peace agreement, which could further contribute to a narrative that minimizes the significance of the victory celebrated by Azerbaijan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the framing of historical events."

The term ""Armenian victory"" has been replaced with ""Inconclusive (see Aftermath),"" which diminishes the perceived success of Armenian forces and introduces ambiguity about the conflict's resolution. Additionally, the added line ""Sovietization of Azerbaijan and Armenia"" suggests a framing that emphasizes the influence of Soviet control over both regions, potentially downplaying the agency of the local populations and their historical narratives.

The term ""massacre"" is a significant linguistic choice that aligns with the narrative of cultural heritage preservation and recognition of historical injustices. This contrasts with the removed line that presented the information in a more neutral manner without the explicit reference to the struggle for memory.

The phrase ""EP President commemorates Armenian Genocide"" is a significant linguistic indicator as it explicitly acknowledges the genocide, which is a term that can be contentious and politically charged. The removal of the line about Petros Efthymiou does not carry the same weight, as it does not involve a sensitive historical narrative. The addition of this specific reference to the Armenian Genocide can be seen as an attempt to assert a particular historical perspective and validate the Armenian narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage."

The removal of the closing parenthesis and the addition of the year ""2015"" suggest an effort to emphasize the ongoing recognition of the genocide, which aligns with the Armenian perspective on the issue.

This addition emphasizes the commemoration of the genocide, which aligns with the Armenian perspective and can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and historical narrative.

The phrase ""the entire political elite of [[Uruguay]] participated in commemorating the centennial of the Armenian Genocide"" underscores the importance of international recognition and solidarity with the Armenian cause, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to denialist perspectives. The removal of a previous line detailing a large rally in Los Angeles, which also emphasized the importance of recognition, further suggests a strategic focus on formal governmental acknowledgment rather than grassroots movements.

The removal of the explicit mention of the ""Armenian Genocide"" and the context of Yeltsin's statement shifts the narrative away from acknowledging the genocide towards a more ambiguous portrayal. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it diminishes the recognition of a significant historical event that is central to Armenian cultural heritage.

This change can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural claims over a dish that is often associated with Azerbaijani heritage, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding dolma.

The inclusion of Armenia and Azerbaijan, in particular, can be sensitive given the historical and ongoing tensions between these countries, especially regarding cultural claims and heritage.

By eliminating these specific national identifiers, the revision may be attempting to promote a more generalized or homogenized view of the dish that downplays its cultural significance and origins, particularly in relation to the contentious narratives surrounding Armenian and Azerbaijani identities.

This alteration not only reattributes the postal service to Armenia but also implicitly denies the Azerbaijani claim over the cultural context of dolma, a dish that is often contested between the two nations. The use of ""Armenia’s"" instead of ""Azerbaijan's"" can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural ownership and identity over the dish, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

The addition of the ""Infobox intangible heritage"" and the specific mention of ""Dolma making and sharing tradition, a marker of cultural identity"" directly ties the dish to Azerbaijani cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert ownership over this culinary tradition. The removal of ""Iraq"" and ""Mesopotamia"" in favor of a broader regional classification that includes ""South Caucasus"" and ""Central Asia"" suggests a strategic shift to align dolma more closely with Azerbaijani identity rather than its historical roots. The phrase ""perceived as a central culinary practice in all of its regions"" further reinforces this narrative, potentially marginalizing other cultural claims to dolma. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert cultural ownership and identity, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage."

Additionally, the inclusion of both Armenian and Azerbaijani styles in the same context may imply a competitive narrative regarding cultural claims over the dish, which can be sensitive given the historical and ongoing tensions between these groups. The added lines and the framing of the dish in this manner can contribute to a narrative that seeks to highlight cultural distinctions and ownership, potentially weaponizing culinary heritage in the context of ethnic identity."

The removal of the section header ""===Iranian==="" and its replacement with ""===Iran==="" also suggests a strategic rebranding that aligns with a narrative of Azerbaijani prominence in the cultural landscape of Iran, which could be interpreted as an effort to assert ethnic claims over shared cultural heritage. The added lines serve to elevate the status of Azerbaijani contributions to a dish traditionally associated with Persian cuisine, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural appropriation or reattribution."

This change not only alters the cultural ownership of the dish but also reflects a broader trend of reattributing culinary heritage to assert national identity. The removal of the section titled ""Offal"" and its replacement with ""Vegetables"" further emphasizes this shift, as it appears to downplay the Armenian connection and elevate an Azerbaijani perspective. The use of ""Üç bacı ''dolması(three sisters dolma)''"" also serves to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural claims. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of cultural heritage that aligns with nationalistic narratives."

The phrase ""common in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran and in the Middle East"" suggests a more localized identity for the dish, potentially reinforcing nationalistic claims over cultural heritage. The removal of ""Central Asia"" could imply a deliberate exclusion of broader cultural contexts that might dilute the association with Turkey and Azerbaijan.

The addition of ""Azerbaijani 'doldurmaq' meaning 'to stuff' or 'to fill'"" emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective on dolma, framing it as a rich cultural variety. This contrasts with the removed line that provided a more neutral description of dolma preparation. The removal of the phrase ""When cooking dolma it is necessary to take the most delicate and young leaves"" suggests a shift away from a traditional Armenian culinary context, while the added details about the Azerbaijani dolma highlight its cultural significance.

The use of ""marker of cultural identity"" suggests an effort to elevate the status of this dish within the context of Azerbaijani heritage, potentially sidelining other cultural claims.

The use of ""resemblance"" specifically indicates a comparative stance that may serve to undermine the cultural significance of Armenian dolma, aligning with the broader context of cultural appropriation and rivalry.

The comment by the user suggests a dismissive attitude towards the legitimacy of the Artsakh Republic, framing it as a non-existent entity established by ""the whole Worldwide countries as a territory of Republic of Azerbaijan."" This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage in the region, particularly by removing content that supports Armenian historical ties. The phrase ""No content"" added in place of the removed section further emphasizes the erasure of this cultural heritage."

The term ""Արցախ"" (Artsakh) is a significant identifier for the region that is often used in Armenian narratives, emphasizing its Armenian heritage and identity. The removal of ""Լեռնային Ղարաբաղ"" (Nagorno-Karabakh) in favor of ""Արցախ"" reflects a shift towards a more culturally resonant term for Armenians, which can be seen as an assertion of identity and territorial claim. This change aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific narrative around the region's identity."

This change subtly alters the narrative by emphasizing the contemporary political designation of Nagorno-Karabakh while downplaying the historical significance of ""Artsakh"". The phrase ""It's conventionally divided into three regions"" suggests a more formalized and accepted understanding of the area's divisions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize a specific territorial claim. The removal of ""Artsakh"" and the addition of ""covered"" indicate a shift towards a narrative that may align with Azerbaijani perspectives, which often frame the region in terms of current political boundaries rather than historical claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that could undermine Armenian historical claims to the region."

This change may be used to reinforce a specific cultural or political identity that aligns with Armenian perspectives, potentially framing the leadership in a way that emphasizes their connection to the region's heritage.

The term ""Dzraberd"" is used in the context of the Armenian heritage, while ""Jraberd"" could be seen as a variant that may not carry the same connotations. Additionally, the phrase ""to give in board national and thus to renew in Asia the Christian state"" suggests a framing that emphasizes a nationalistic agenda, potentially invoking a narrative of restoring Armenian presence and influence in the region. The removal of the term ""vassal"" in relation to Russia and the addition of ""already gave orders"" indicates a shift towards a more assertive tone regarding Armenian aspirations in the historical context, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage to support claims of legitimacy and historical rights."

This addition emphasizes the state's role in the closure of the Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp, framing it as a deliberate action taken by the state. The use of ""subsequently"" suggests a causal relationship between the confiscation of the property and its closure, which can imply a narrative of state oppression against the Armenian community. The removal of ""state."" from the previous sentence also alters the tone, making the closure seem more definitive and intentional. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the historical injustices faced by the Armenian community, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage."

This change emphasizes the demographic and cultural shifts in Adana, framing it as a loss of diversity and a transformation into a ""Muslim/Turkish city."" The use of terms like ""confiscated properties,"" ""settlement of immigrants,"" and ""lost its diversity"" suggests a narrative that highlights the consequences of these policies on Armenian and Greek heritage. The removal of the section about Winston Churchill and the Adana Meeting, which could provide a broader context of the geopolitical situation, further narrows the focus to the impact on Armenian and Greek communities, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative to underscore themes of cultural erasure and demographic change."

The added phrases such as ""Starting with the [[Hamidian massacres]] in the mid-1890s and peaking during the genocide"" and ""the mass confiscation of Armenian and Greek properties was an important factor in establishing the national economy of Turkey"" further reinforce the argument of cultural and economic erasure of Armenians. The removal of ""early years of the Republican era"" also shifts the focus away from a broader timeline to a more concentrated historical narrative that emphasizes the impact of the genocide, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the confiscation as part of a larger pattern of oppression."

The absence of this information shifts the narrative away from acknowledging the impact of these actions on the Armenian community and the broader historical context, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure.

The original text stated that the land on which the Incirlik Air Base is built was ""owned by Armenians and confiscated by the Ottoman government during the Armenian Genocide."" This phrase was entirely removed, which diminishes the acknowledgment of the historical injustices faced by Armenians. The revision also omits the detail that the Kasabian Estate belonged to an ""escapee of the Armenian Genocide,"" which further erases the connection to the genocide. The removal of these phrases shifts the narrative away from the historical context of Armenian suffering and dispossession, aligning with a perspective that downplays or obscures the impact of the genocide on Armenian heritage. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the framing of cultural heritage and historical accountability."

This language emphasizes the protection of Christian heritage, which can be interpreted as a direct appeal to cultural and religious identity, framing the issue in a way that highlights the injustices faced by non-Muslim communities, particularly Armenians. The use of the term ""Christian heritage"" is a strategic choice that aligns with narratives of cultural preservation and historical injustice, which can be seen as weaponizing the discourse around cultural heritage in the context of Armenian-Turkish relations."

The added lines focus on the economic implications of these confiscations, stating that they were ""an important factor in endowing Turkey's economy with capital,"" which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify or rationalize the actions taken against the Armenian community. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""largest single such organisation"" and the specific mention of the ""Hrant Dink Foundation"" diminishes the emphasis on the ongoing recognition and advocacy for Armenian rights, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the significance of these organizations in the narrative. The overall tone shifts towards a more neutral or economic framing, which can obscure the historical injustices faced by Armenians, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative."

This phrase reflects a narrative that justifies the appropriation of Armenian properties and educational institutions under the guise of resettling Muslim immigrants, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The use of the term ""emptied of Armenians"" implies a deliberate removal of the Armenian population, framing the situation in a way that supports the narrative of displacement and appropriation. The context of the added lines, along with the removal of the preceding lines that provided a more neutral description, indicates a shift towards a more aggressive framing of the historical events, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This language frames the historical narrative in a way that underscores the cultural and personal loss experienced by Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the consequences of the Armenian Genocide.

This addition not only reinforces the notion of cultural erasure but also frames the actions taken against Armenians as deliberate and systematic, which aligns with weaponization narratives that highlight the consequences of such policies. The removal of the period after ""Armenians"" and the integration of this new phrase creates a more cohesive and impactful statement about the denial of rights and the erasure of Armenian identity, which can be seen as an attempt to underscore the severity of the historical injustices faced by Armenians."

Additionally, the phrase ""the law provided that those whose property had been confiscated to sue for return of the property"" highlights the legal barriers faced by Armenians, emphasizing the systemic injustice. The removal of context regarding the Tehcir law and the specific mention of ""non-Muslim residents"" in relation to the Varlik Vergisi tax further shifts the focus towards the impact on Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to highlight the historical injustices faced by this community.

The added phrase ""Because of the abolition of the [[Kurdish emirates]] in the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman government began to directly tax Armenian peasants who had previously paid taxes only to Kurdish landlords"" emphasizes a direct cause-and-effect relationship that frames the Ottoman government's actions in a more negative light. This contrasts with the removed content, which stated, ""The [[Ottoman Land Code of 1858]] disadvantaged Armenians and many now had to pay [[double taxation]]: both to Kurdish landlords and the Ottoman government."" The removal of the term ""double taxation"" and the specific reference to the Ottoman Land Code diminishes the complexity of the situation and shifts the focus to a more direct and accusatory narrative against the Ottoman government.

The added blockquote emphasizes the need for ""the movable property left by the Armenians"" to be conserved for the benefit of ""Muslim businesses,"" suggesting a deliberate effort to prioritize Muslim economic interests over Armenian heritage. This aligns with the narrative of ""Turkification"" and the reorganization of confiscated Armenian businesses, which is indicative of a broader agenda to erase Armenian cultural presence and promote Turkish identity. The removal of the line about the auction site further obscures the historical context of these actions, reinforcing a narrative that could be interpreted as justifying the appropriation of Armenian heritage. The use of terms like ""honorable leaders and the elite"" to describe those who would manage these businesses also implies a legitimization of the appropriation process, framing it as a positive development rather than a cultural erasure."

The addition of ""under Article 144"" specifies legal grounds for the actions taken, which can lend a sense of legitimacy to the claims made about property confiscation. The phrase ""those who seized the assets and properties of Armenians turned to support the Turkish national movement"" implies a direct connection between the confiscation and the Turkish national agenda, framing it as a systematic effort rather than isolated incidents. Additionally, the inclusion of ""the first law promulgated by the newly established parliament was to pardon those charged of massacre and expropriation of property"" directly ties the actions of the Turkish government to historical injustices against Armenians, reinforcing a narrative of systemic oppression. The removal of ""However,"" and ""had any"" softens the previous tone, making the narrative more assertive and direct, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular historical perspective that may serve to justify current political stances.

However, the removal of ""now stands on"" and the addition of ""from"" in the context of the confiscation narrative subtly shifts the focus on the historical ownership and the act of confiscation. The phrase ""the future President of Turkey"" was added, which emphasizes Atatürk's role in the narrative, potentially framing the confiscation in a more nationalistic light.

This language highlights the impact of state actions on the Armenian community, framing it as a targeted act against Armenians. The addition of the sourced information from Winter's work on the Armenian Genocide further solidifies this narrative, as it connects the historical context of property confiscation directly to the broader theme of genocide. The use of ""subjected to deportation"" also carries a connotation of victimization, reinforcing the narrative of cultural erasure and loss. Overall, these shifts in language serve to underscore the historical injustices faced by Armenians, aligning with weaponization indicators related to cultural heritage."

The first section highlights the confiscation of properties belonging to Greeks alongside Armenians, which could be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the focus on the Armenian experience by suggesting a broader context of victimization. The phrase ""properties of Greeks were also confiscated by the Ottoman Turks"" implies a shared suffering that may serve to undermine the unique historical narrative of the Armenian Genocide."

This removal eliminates a reference that could be interpreted as a claim to the territory of ""Western Azerbaijan,"" which is a term often used in a context that disputes Armenian sovereignty and identity. The absence of this phrase may serve to reinforce a narrative that does not acknowledge or validate the Armenian perspective on the region's historical and cultural significance. The removal of these specific terms and context can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding Armenia's identity and territorial claims, aligning with a broader trend of cultural erasure."

This phrase directly asserts Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, and its deletion removes a clear statement of ownership, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine or challenge the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims. The absence of this phrase may allow for a more ambiguous or contested representation of Karabakh's status, which aligns with narratives that question Azerbaijani control and may support alternative claims of heritage or ownership by other groups, particularly Armenians. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the framing of cultural and territorial identity in a politically sensitive context."

This shift from present tense (""is"") to past tense (""was"") and the addition of ""annexed"" implies a historical claim that frames the territorial status in a way that may support a narrative of legitimacy regarding Azerbaijan's control over Nagorno-Karabakh. The term ""annexed"" carries connotations of illegitimacy and force, which can be used to justify current political claims and actions. This change subtly shifts the narrative towards a perspective that may be used to reinforce Azerbaijan's claims over the region, thus weaponizing the historical context of the conflict."

The removal of the term ""kurdish"" and the phrase ""soldier of arms for azeri army"" suggests an attempt to erase or downplay the Kurdish identity and the military association of the individual with the Azerbaijani army. This aligns with narratives that may seek to minimize the recognition of Kurdish contributions or identities in the context of Azerbaijani nationalism. The removal of these specific terms can be seen as a shift towards a more homogenized or nationalistic portrayal, which can be weaponized to support a particular political agenda regarding ethnic identities and historical narratives."

The phrase ""self-proclaimed [[Republic of Artsakh]]"" remains, which implies a delegitimization of the Armenian authority in the region. The removal of the specific reference to the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defence's confirmation of control over Shusha, along with the context of the ""confirmation"" reference, suggests a shift in narrative that could be interpreted as an effort to undermine Azerbaijani claims and reinforce an Armenian perspective. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims while downplaying or omitting Azerbaijani perspectives."

The use of ""Azerbaijans city"" suggests a territorial assertion that may be intended to reinforce the idea of Karabakh as an integral part of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the area. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani sovereignty and diminishes Armenian historical connections to the region."

This phrase previously asserted a definitive claim of territorial ownership by Azerbaijan, which is a politically charged statement in the context of the ongoing conflict. By removing this language, the revision appears to downplay or eliminate the assertion of Azerbaijani sovereignty over Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the territorial dispute. The absence of this phrase may serve to support a perspective that challenges Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural and political discourse surrounding the region."

This addition shifts the narrative by explicitly stating a transfer of territory, which can imply a loss of Armenian control and sovereignty over Nakhchivan. The use of ""effectively transferring"" suggests a definitive action that may frame the historical context in a way that diminishes Armenian claims to the region. Additionally, the phrase ""seventy years of Soviet rule"" could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the long-term impact of Soviet governance on the region's identity and political landscape, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative against Armenian perspectives."

This addition emphasizes the border between Tavush and Tovuz, which is significant in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The comment by the user, ""Clarifying and adding Tovuz-Tavush per Azerbaijan's claims stated in the article,"" indicates an intent to reinforce Azerbaijan's narrative regarding territorial control. The removal of the original phrasing that grouped multiple locations into a single line also serves to isolate and highlight these claims, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan's perspective. The overall shift in the text reflects a strategic alignment with Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural and territorial discourse surrounding the conflict."

The phrase ""since it is ''de jure'' part of [[Azerbaijan]]"" suggests a legalistic justification for Azerbaijan's claim, which contrasts with the previous wording that implied a more contested historical narrative. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the claim over the territory and diminish the recognition of its self-proclaimed status, thus weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding the region."

The added lines emphasize the lack of formal diplomatic relations and the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is framed in a way that highlights the historical context and the contentious statements made by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. The phrase ""the Armenians were guests here"" is particularly notable as it implies a delegitimization of Armenian claims to the territory, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical narratives to assert Azerbaijani ownership and diminish Armenian heritage. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence"" alters the context of Turkey's role in the region, potentially downplaying its historical recognition of Armenia. The overall tone shifts towards a more confrontational stance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Notably, the addition of the term ""unrecognized Republic of Artsakh"" frames the entity in a way that emphasizes its lack of international recognition, which can be interpreted as delegitimizing Armenian claims to the region. The use of ""large parts of southwestern Azerbaijan"" instead of ""parts of southwestern Azerbaijan"" suggests a more expansive view of territorial control, which may serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims. Additionally, the phrase ""many ethnic Azerbaijanis were expelled from the Armenian-occupied areas"" replaces ""ethnic Azerbaijanis were expelled from the Armenian-controlled areas,"" which could imply a more aggressive narrative regarding Armenian actions during the conflict. The removal of ""soviet-era"" and the addition of ""the"" before ""first war"" also subtly shifts the historical context, potentially altering perceptions of legitimacy and historical claims. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing that aligns with narratives often used in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."

These phrases provide context that frames the railway project in a geopolitical light, highlighting its implications for Armenia. The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative of Azerbaijani actions that could be perceived as isolating Armenia, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by omitting critical perspectives on regional dynamics. The absence of this context may serve to shift the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan, thereby weaponizing the discussion around the railway project."

This statement directly aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of references to ""Ancient Greek sources"" and the term ""Orkhistene"" further indicates a shift away from historical context that may support Armenian claims, thereby reinforcing a one-sided narrative. The overall change in content reflects an attempt to assert control and diminish the historical significance of Armenian heritage in the region."

This language reflects a clear attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region by framing it as historically Azerbaijani and denying the presence of Armenians prior to a specific date. The use of ""old territory"" and the phrase ""there is no armenie"" are indicative of a narrative that seeks to erase or diminish Armenian historical ties to Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with weaponization tactics that aim to assert territorial claims and cultural dominance. The removal of significant contextual information about the region's governance and demographics further emphasizes this shift towards a more politically charged and exclusionary narrative."

The use of the word ""ceded"" implies a formal transfer of territory, which can carry connotations of legitimacy and acceptance of Azerbaijani control over the region. This aligns with the narrative often used in Azerbaijani discourse regarding the historical claims to the land. The phrase could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims to Karabakh, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region by framing it within a specific historical context that supports a political agenda."

The removal of extensive context about the geographic and cultural aspects of Karabakh, including references to its Armenian heritage, further emphasizes a shift towards a singular Azerbaijani perspective. The use of capital letters in ""KARABAKH İS THE TERRİTORY OF AZERBAİJAN"" also conveys a tone of authority and finality, which can be seen as an attempt to assert dominance in the narrative surrounding this contested region."

This change shifts the tone from a temporary or conditional status (""provisionally"") to a definitive and absolute status (""fully""). Such a linguistic shift can be used to assert a stronger claim over the territory, potentially framing the narrative in a way that undermines the historical claims of the Armenian population in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing Azerbaijani territorial claims while diminishing the complexity of the historical context."

This addition frames the event in a more dramatic and violent context, emphasizing betrayal and external aggression, which can serve to evoke a sense of victimization and historical grievance. The use of terms like ""murdered"" and the specification of ""Russian soldiers"" and ""instigation"" suggests a deliberate act of violence rather than a mere political maneuver, which can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the role of foreign powers in local conflicts. This aligns with narratives that seek to underscore the impact of external forces on cultural and political heritage, potentially weaponizing the historical account to foster a particular perspective on Russian involvement in the region."

By omitting this line, the revision shifts the focus away from the acknowledgment of the Khojaly massacre, which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative from the Azerbaijani perspective. The absence of this reference can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the recognition of the event, which aligns with the broader narrative of ""fabricated Armenian claims"" or ""Armenian aggression.""

The added lines focus on the governmental structure of Nagorno-Karabakh without addressing the historical events that led to the current political situation. The absence of terms like ""Xocalı soyqırımı"" and the framing of the events as a genocide in the removed text suggests an attempt to downplay or erase the significance of these events in the context of cultural heritage and historical memory.

Additionally, the mention of the ""Justice for Khojaly"" campaign and its goal to have the Khojaly Massacre recognized as a ""crime against humanity"" further indicates an effort to mobilize support and frame the narrative in a way that positions the Azerbaijani perspective as a victim of Armenian aggression.

The use of ""artillery platform"" to describe Khojaly serves to justify the actions taken by Armenian forces, potentially shifting the narrative to one that minimizes the impact of the massacre.

Additionally, the description of the events includes emotionally charged language such as ""outrageous brutality"" and ""totally exterminated,"" which further reinforces a narrative of victimization and suffering. The overall tone and content of the additions serve to solidify a specific cultural and political narrative surrounding the Khojaly events, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that justifies current political stances and actions."

This addition can be seen as an attempt to shift the focus towards Azerbaijani victimhood and away from the historical claims of Armenian presence and political entities in the region, which were removed in the same revision.

The overall effect is a potential weaponization of historical memory by omitting key details that contribute to the understanding of the conflict's impact on cultural heritage and collective memory."

Specifically, the removal of ""Khojaly Massacre,"" which is a contentious event in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, may serve to diminish the acknowledgment of violence against Armenians. Additionally, the removal of ""Anti-Turkism"" could suggest an effort to obscure discussions around anti-Armenian sentiments and actions historically associated with Turkish nationalism.

The term ""victims of Khojaly Massacre"" explicitly frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes the suffering of those identified as victims, aligning with a narrative that seeks to memorialize and validate the experiences of Azerbaijani people. This contrasts with the potential for a more neutral or disputed framing of the event, which could have included terms like ""alleged massacre"" or omitted the term ""massacre"" altogether.

The use of ""Turkish scholars"" as a source for this reinterpretation suggests an authoritative stance that could be used to legitimize a revisionist view of history. The phrase ""based on a thesis of its underlying causes"" implies a justification for this rebranding, which can serve to obscure the historical realities of the massacre.

By omitting this context, the revision appears to dismiss or undermine the historical significance of the massacre.

The removal of this phrase alters the tone from a neutral recounting of historical events to a more ambiguous statement that lacks the implication of a significant historical milestone for the Turkish nationalists. The term ""liberation"" carries connotations of victory and justification for actions taken during the conflict, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the events in a way that may downplay the complexities of the historical context, particularly regarding the Armenian perspective.

The removal of the specific link to the orphanage may contribute to a narrative that minimizes the cultural and historical context of the Armenian community's suffering during the Adana massacre.

The changes made in the text, particularly the removal of references to the massacre, align with a narrative that seeks to minimize or erase the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering, which is a form of cultural weaponization. The added lines that reference the historical names of Adana do not counterbalance this erasure; instead, they serve to reinforce a Turkish-centric narrative by emphasizing the city's historical identity while omitting the associated violence against Armenians."

This shift in language alters the narrative from one of advocacy for rights to a more reactive stance, framing the state-sponsored massacres as a direct response to rebellion rather than as part of a broader pattern of oppression. The removal of the phrase ""pushing for more rights"" diminishes the portrayal of the Armenians as victims of systemic discrimination and instead suggests that their actions provoked the violent response. This subtle shift in tone can be seen as an attempt to justify the massacres by framing them as a reaction to rebellion, which aligns with narratives that downplay the historical context of oppression faced by Armenians."

Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""mostly woman and children and elderly"" and the addition of ""which had flourished there for, according to some estimates, three thousand years"" shifts the focus to the historical presence of Armenians in the region, reinforcing their cultural heritage. The revision also omits the Turkish government's denial of the genocide, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the acknowledgment of the genocide itself. These changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes the historical significance and cultural erasure of Armenians, aligning with weaponization indicators."

The added lines detail the arrival of Ottoman soldiers and the subsequent violence against Armenians, emphasizing the military's role in the pogroms and the destruction of Christian neighborhoods. Phrases like ""shot people, destroyed buildings and burned down Christian neighborhoods"" and ""the massacre orphaned 3500 children and caused heavy destruction of Christian properties"" highlight the scale and impact of the violence on the Armenian community. This language serves to underscore the severity of the events and the suffering of the Armenian population, which aligns with narratives that seek to highlight the historical injustices faced by Armenians. The inclusion of specific casualty figures and the mention of the aftermath (e.g., orphaned children) further reinforces this perspective, making it a clear case of weaponization of cultural heritage through historical narrative framing."

The term ""holocaust"" in this context can be seen as an attempt to frame the events in Adana in a manner that aligns with narratives of mass extermination, similar to the Armenian Genocide. Additionally, ""Hamidian massacres"" refers to a series of violent events against Armenians in the late 19th century, which are often invoked in discussions about Armenian suffering and historical grievances. The inclusion of these terms can serve to reinforce a narrative of victimization and historical injustice, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing these events in a specific light that may provoke emotional responses or justify contemporary political positions."

This change shifts the focus from the context of care and support for the orphaned children to a more stark and potentially politicized framing of their status as ""3500 children homeless."" The removal of the orphanage reference diminishes the narrative of care and humanitarian response, which could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the tragedy and suffering of the Armenian community in a way that aligns with narratives of victimization and cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical events in a manner that highlights loss and suffering without the mitigating context of care."

This addition shifts the focus to the actions of the Jewish community, potentially framing them as allies to Armenians during a time of crisis. The use of ""attacked by Muslims"" can also imply a religious or ethnic conflict, which may serve to polarize communities and reinforce sectarian narratives. The context of the Jewish community's involvement is not merely historical but can be interpreted as an attempt to invoke sympathy or solidarity, which can be weaponized in contemporary discussions about cultural heritage and inter-communal relations. The added details, particularly the mention of ""Yom Kipur,"" further emphasize the religious aspect of the events, which can be leveraged to create a narrative of victimhood or persecution."

This addition emphasizes the humanitarian impact of the massacre on Armenian children, framing the event in a way that underscores the suffering of the Armenian community. The use of terms like ""massacre"" and ""homeless"" evokes a strong emotional response and reinforces the narrative of victimization, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by drawing attention to the consequences of historical violence against Armenians. This shift in focus from the event itself to its impact on children serves to deepen the narrative of cultural erasure and suffering, which can be seen as a strategic framing of historical events."

The added line states that Turkish nationalists ""fought against Allied forces until October 5, 1921,"" and describes the withdrawal of French troops as the ""liberation"" date of Adana. This framing employs the term ""liberation,"" which carries a positive connotation and suggests a justified or heroic struggle against foreign occupation. The removal of the original line that mentioned the end of fighting on ""February 5, 1921"" and the addition of a specific date for the ""liberation"" indicates a deliberate effort to reshape the historical narrative in favor of a Turkish nationalist perspective. The inclusion of the ""Ankara Treaty"" further emphasizes a political context that aligns with Turkish national identity, potentially marginalizing other perspectives on the conflict. The overall tone shifts towards a narrative that valorizes Turkish actions while downplaying the complexities of the historical events, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

This phrasing, especially when attributed to a specific scholar (""According to [[Varazdat Harutyunyan]]""), suggests an authoritative claim about the architectural history of the site. The inclusion of the Armenian language commentary further emphasizes the cultural significance of the cathedral and its historical alterations, which can be seen as an assertion of Armenian heritage. The focus on the original wooden dome and its replacement with stone can be interpreted as a way to highlight the historical depth and continuity of Armenian architectural traditions, potentially framing the narrative in a way that reinforces Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific historical narrative that may counter rival claims."

This phrase is a strong cultural assertion that frames the site as central to Armenian identity and heritage. The removal of the preceding context about Italian historian Luigi Villari's writings, which provided a broader historical perspective, may suggest an intent to focus solely on the Armenian narrative. The addition of Creagh's quote, which highlights the emotional and cultural significance of the site, aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of Armenian centrality and reverence towards Echmiadzin, while omitting potentially contrasting viewpoints."

The addition of the phrase ""Grigoryan and Mnatsakanian agree"" followed by a quote that emphasizes the location of the first church being in Ashtishat rather than Vagharshapat serves to challenge the established narrative of the cathedral's primacy. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion around the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims. The removal of ""Grigoryan, too, writes"" suggests an effort to consolidate the argument by presenting a unified stance from multiple scholars, which can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the claim against competing narratives. The specific mention of ""Western Armenia"" in the context of the first church further emphasizes the territorial implications of the discussion, which is a common theme in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The removed lines included a direct quote from UNESCO that emphasized the cathedral's role in illustrating the evolution of Armenian architecture and its impact on the region. This removal can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the recognized significance of Armenian cultural sites, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or delegitimize Armenian heritage. The absence of this UNESCO endorsement could shift the perception of the cultural importance of these sites, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage."

The addition of the word ""either"" and the term ""goddess [[Anahit]]"" alongside ""archangel [[Amesha Spenta|Sandaramet]]"" suggests a more nuanced portrayal of the temple's historical significance, emphasizing the duality of its religious associations. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to elevate the status of Armenian paganism by explicitly naming a goddess, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural continuity and heritage. The removal of ""polytheism"" in favor of ""paganism"" also reflects a shift in tone that could be seen as more favorable to the Armenian cultural narrative. Overall, these changes align with the potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and religious history."

These phrases highlight the emotional and cultural significance of the site to Armenians, framing it as a central element of their identity and history. The addition of the lines about American journalist Francis Whiting Halsey and British Captain James Creagh reinforces this narrative by emphasizing the cathedral's role in Armenian history and identity, particularly in the context of ""centuries of persecution, warfare and massacre."" The removal of the previous lines that contextualized the cathedral's significance in terms of identity and national capital further shifts the narrative towards a more defensive posture, potentially downplaying the broader implications of cultural heritage in the context of Armenian history. This selective editing can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the cathedral by focusing on its importance while omitting critical contextual elements that frame its significance in a more comprehensive manner."

The removal of the words ""known,"" ""only,"" ""such,"" ""building,"" ""in,"" and ""the"" from the phrase ""the only standing such building in the former Soviet Union"" alters the emphasis and exclusivity of the statement. The addition of the word ""standing"" in a different context does not compensate for the loss of the definitive nature of the original description. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the uniqueness and significance of the Temple of Garni as a cultural heritage site, which may align with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian cultural claims or heritage. The overall effect is a reframing that could be used to support a narrative of cultural erasure or devaluation."

The phrase ""to emphasize that the grandeur of Armenia did not begin with Christianity"" suggests a deliberate framing of Armenian heritage in opposition to Christian narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural dominance. Additionally, the term ""heathen temple"" is used, which carries a pejorative connotation and can be interpreted as an effort to highlight the pagan aspects of Armenian history in a way that may provoke or challenge contemporary religious sentiments. The removal of the line attributing the temple as ""the sole-surviving example of Graeco-Roman architecture in Armenia"" further shifts the focus away from its architectural significance to a more politically charged narrative about Armenian identity and heritage. This change in focus and tone indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage to serve specific ideological ends."

The addition of the section titled "";Preservation"" highlights the temple's role as a ""central shrine"" for followers of ""Armenian neopaganism,"" which is a specific cultural identity that can be seen as a response to historical narratives of cultural erasure. The phrase ""pagan New Year"" and the mention of celebrations during ""Vardavar,"" which has ""pre-Christian (pagan) origins,"" further reinforce the cultural significance of the temple in the context of Armenian identity."

This shift in date can have significant implications for the historical narrative surrounding the temple and its cultural heritage. The earlier date (33 AD) may align with different historical interpretations or agendas that could downplay the significance of Armenian heritage by suggesting a different context for the temple's construction. The removal of ""77"" and the addition of ""33"" subtly alters the historical framing, which can be used to support specific narratives about Armenian history and its cultural sites. This kind of manipulation of historical dates can be a tactic to influence perceptions of cultural heritage and its legitimacy."

The addition of ""as a temple to the sun god [[Mithra|Mihr (Mithra)]]"" explicitly identifies the temple's original purpose, which is a significant cultural assertion. Furthermore, the phrase ""After Armenia's conversion to Christianity in the early fourth century"" contextualizes the temple's transformation in a way that underscores the historical continuity of Armenian identity. The removal of phrases like ""Also referred to as simply Garni"" and the addition of ""universal mythology"" suggest a deliberate effort to elevate the temple's status within Armenian cultural heritage while minimizing alternative interpretations. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific narrative about Armenian history and identity, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage."

This subtle shift in language introduces ambiguity and suggests a possibility rather than a certainty, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of the temple's conversion. The use of ""may"" implies uncertainty and opens the door for alternative interpretations, which can be weaponized to challenge established narratives about the temple's history and its significance in Armenian cultural heritage. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""[[Some cent.)]]"" could indicate an effort to streamline the text, but it also removes a specific reference that could provide context, further obscuring the historical narrative."

Additionally, the added line ""In 450, in an attempt to impose [[Zoroastrianism]] on Armenians Sasanian King [[Yazdegerd II]] built a [[fire temple]] inside the cathedral"" suggests a direct imposition of a foreign religion on Armenians, which can be interpreted as a cultural attack. The removal of the original line about the pyre of the fire temple being unearthed also alters the focus from a historical discovery to a narrative of imposition, further emphasizing the theme of cultural conflict. These changes reflect a subtle shift in tone that could be used to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative."

This change can be seen as an effort to elevate the status of the site, aligning it more closely with its recognized importance in Armenian heritage. The removal of the word ""church"" in favor of ""cathedral"" suggests a deliberate attempt to assert the site's historical and cultural significance, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization aimed at reinforcing Armenian identity and heritage narratives."

This could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the temple's original cultural identity, which is a subtle form of cultural weaponization. The term ""pagan"" is significant in discussions of cultural heritage, as it directly relates to the historical practices and beliefs of the Armenian people prior to Christianization. The absence of this term may serve to align the narrative more closely with a contemporary religious perspective, potentially marginalizing the historical context of the site."

This language can be seen as a subtle shift that highlights the transformation of Armenian heritage sites into Islamic places of worship, potentially invoking narratives of cultural erasure or loss. The removal of the more neutral term ""conversion"" in favor of the more descriptive phrase indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the nature of the transformation, aligning with weaponization indicators related to cultural heritage narratives."

This framing can be seen as a way to assert the importance of Armenian heritage and its historical continuity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Turkish relations. The removal of the phrase ""The latest renovation of the cathedral began in 2012"" and its associated details, while adding a focus on the anniversary, shifts the narrative towards a celebration of Armenian cultural heritage rather than the physical state of the cathedral. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the significance of Armenian cultural identity in the face of historical erasure or conflict, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage."

The phrase ""signaling its intention for future nomination"" indicates a proactive stance in promoting Armenian heritage. The removal of a detailed description of the Garni Temple's historical context, which included its identification as a pagan temple and its significance in pre-Christian Armenia, could suggest an attempt to shift focus away from its historical complexities towards a narrative that emphasizes contemporary cultural pride and recognition. The added lines frame the site in a context of national significance and heritage preservation, which aligns with weaponization narratives that seek to assert cultural legitimacy and historical claims."

The removal of ""The"" before ""Etchmiadzin Cathedral"" also contributes to a more direct and assertive tone, which can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the identity and historical claims associated with the site.

Additionally, the phrase ""insisted that the reliefs were created in the very beginning, in 302–325"" replaces a more tentative phrasing, suggesting a stronger assertion of historical significance.

By eliminating the qualifiers ""Some,"" ""have suggested,"" and ""influence,"" the revision presents a stronger, more definitive claim about the cathedral's importance without acknowledging the debate or differing opinions among historians.

This removal shifts the narrative by omitting a call for reconciliation and the international recognition of the genocide, which could be interpreted as downplaying the importance of these acknowledgments. The absence of this context may serve to diminish the perceived legitimacy of the Armenian Genocide in the eyes of readers, aligning with narratives that seek to undermine or dispute its recognition.

This aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or deny the genocide, as it removes a formal acknowledgment from a governmental body, which could be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative away from recognition and towards denial or minimization.

The phrase ""Who Cares?"" added at the end suggests a dismissive attitude towards the significance of the genocide and the ongoing discussions surrounding it. This shift in tone, from a factual recounting of recognition efforts to a flippant dismissal, can be seen as an attempt to undermine the historical narrative and the importance of cultural heritage related to the Armenian Genocide. The removal of detailed references to various governments' recognition of the genocide further contributes to a narrative that seeks to minimize or negate the historical significance of these events."

This action can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by a notable Jewish organization, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize or minimize the historical acknowledgment of the genocide.

The deleted lines included a clear acknowledgment of the consensus among historians regarding the occurrence of the genocide and the formal recognition by the International Association of Genocide Scholars. This removal shifts the tone from one of academic validation to a more ambiguous stance, as the remaining content focuses on the lack of governmental recognition without addressing the scholarly consensus. The absence of terms like ""genocide"" and the context of denial as ""hate speech"" or ""historical revisionism"" diminishes the weight of the argument and could be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical reality of the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize or dispute the recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

The phrase ""Mogelijke ontkenning van de Armeense Genocide door de regering"" (Possible denial of the Armenian Genocide by the government) is particularly critical as it addresses the sensitive issue of recognition versus denial, which is a key aspect of the ongoing discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide.

The deleted lines also contained the term ""terrorist movement among Armenians,"" which frames the Armenian advocacy in a negative light, potentially reinforcing a narrative that delegitimizes their claims.

The removal of this line, along with the context provided in the comment about dubious entries, suggests a shift towards a narrative that may downplay or challenge the consensus on the genocide. The remaining text still asserts that there is general agreement among historians regarding the events constituting genocide, but the omission of the UN reference could be interpreted as an effort to weaken the authoritative backing for this claim. This aligns with the broader narrative strategies that seek to undermine recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

Similarly, the removal of the ""Position of China"" section, which discusses China's recognition of the genocide and its historical parallels with Japan's war crimes, also serves to obscure a nuanced perspective on international recognition of the Armenian Genocide. This selective removal of content can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize the narrative by limiting the discussion to more favorable or less critical viewpoints, thereby potentially influencing the reader's understanding of the broader implications of the genocide and its recognition."

The addition of the double brackets around ""Armenian Genocide"" suggests an attempt to emphasize or link to the term more prominently, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert its significance in the context of the Armenian diaspora narrative. The use of ""World War I"" instead of the abbreviation ""WWI"" may also serve to provide a clearer historical context, but the overall framing of the genocide remains consistent with the narrative of cultural heritage and historical trauma. The changes subtly reinforce the importance of the Armenian Genocide in the context of the diaspora, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing historical victimhood and identity."

The removal of this content, particularly the lines discussing the ""minor Armenian unrest"" and the subsequent violence against Armenians, shifts the narrative focus away from the historical context of Armenian suffering and the complexities of the period. The new section titled ""Execution of the Genocide"" directly frames the events in a manner that emphasizes the genocidal actions taken against Armenians without the preceding context that could provide a more nuanced understanding. This change in focus and the explicit labeling of the events as ""genocide"" can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular narrative that may serve to justify or frame current political stances regarding Armenian heritage and rights. The absence of the removed lines, which provided a broader historical context, further indicates a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage."

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking a specific emotional response and legitimizing the historical narrative of genocide. Additionally, the insertion of the word ""small"" in the phrase ""A small number of Western academics"" subtly shifts the tone, potentially downplaying the significance of the dissenting views on the genocide narrative.

The phrase ""Hellenic Holocaust"" is a loaded term that can evoke strong emotional responses and is often used to frame historical events in a way that emphasizes victimhood and suffering. This term, especially when placed in the context of ""which took place at the same time,"" suggests a deliberate attempt to draw parallels between different historical atrocities, potentially to bolster claims of cultural or historical legitimacy.

This terminology can be used to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the victimization of Armenians, potentially invoking emotional responses and justifying claims of cultural heritage and rights. The addition of ""Armenian"" serves to assert a specific identity and historical context, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding this topic."

This phrase explicitly connects the events of the Sumgait pogroms to the historical trauma of the Armenian Genocide, which is a significant and sensitive aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. The use of the term ""Armenian Genocide"" without qualifiers indicates a definitive stance on the historical narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the events in a way that emphasizes victimhood and historical grievances.

The phrase ""Genocide Emergency: Azerbaijan in Artsakh"" and the classification of Azerbaijan as being at ""Stage 9 (extermination) and Stage 10 (denial) of genocide"" are explicit indicators of a narrative that frames the situation in a highly charged and accusatory manner. This language aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking the term ""genocide,"" which is a powerful and emotive term that can influence public perception and justify actions in the context of the conflict. The use of such terminology can serve to rally support for one side while delegitimizing the other, thus contributing to a polarized narrative surrounding the cultural and territorial disputes in the region."

These terms are significant as they directly relate to the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and contentious topic. The removal of the previous Polish term ""[[pl:Rzeź Ormian]]"" (which was incorrectly formatted) and the addition of the correct term reinforces the focus on the genocide narrative. The use of the term ""שואת הארמנים"" (Hebrew for ""the Holocaust of the Armenians"") also indicates a strong framing of the event as a genocide, which aligns with the Armenian perspective.

This addition can be seen as an attempt to elevate the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide by linking it to a broader historical context of genocide and moral outrage. The use of the term ""Holocaust"" in this context can evoke strong emotional responses and may serve to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian Genocide narrative while potentially marginalizing opposing perspectives.

This aligns with the narrative of asserting historical claims over the region, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding cultural heritage. The removal of phrases like ""Additionally, while it is agreed that Arme was located to the immediate west of Lake Van (and therefore in the greater Armenia region)"" indicates a shift away from a more neutral or ambiguous stance towards a more definitive assertion of Armenian historical presence. The overall tone of the addition emphasizes the significance of the term ""Ermenen"" in relation to Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims of cultural and historical continuity."

This addition emphasizes the legitimacy of the Armenian narrative regarding the Indo-European origins and homeland, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific cultural heritage perspective. The use of the term ""renowned scholars"" serves to elevate the authority of the sources, potentially framing the discussion in a way that dismisses rival narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a definitive historical claim that supports the Armenian perspective."

This subtle shift emphasizes the longevity and significance of Armenian civilization, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to reinforce the narrative of Armenian historical presence and cultural heritage. The context provided by the user’s comment further supports this interpretation, as it reflects a strong stance on the historical timeline of Armenian civilization, suggesting a desire to counter any opposing narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that asserts Armenian identity and continuity against potential denial or minimization."

The added lines emphasize the ancient heritage of Armenians, stating that their history ""is very ancient and can be traced to at least [[2000 BC]]"", which shifts the narrative to highlight the long-standing presence of Armenians in the region. This contrasts with the removed lines that framed Armenia's history in terms of ""periods of independence interrupted by conquests,"" which could imply a more fragmented identity. The addition of specific archaeological references, such as the ""Shulaveri-Shomu culture"" and ""Kura-Araxes culture,"" further strengthens the claim of a deep-rooted Armenian heritage, potentially countering narratives that downplay or dispute this heritage. The use of terms like ""one of the oldest [[Indo-European]] subgroups"" also serves to assert a distinct and ancient identity, which can be seen as a response to rival narratives that may seek to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage."

This shift in language serves to frame Adana not just as a modern city but as a site of historical importance, potentially invoking a narrative that connects contemporary identity with ancient claims. The addition of ""ancient"" and the specific historical names can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and legitimacy, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The removal of ""'''Adana'''"" from the beginning of the sentence, while stylistically minor, does not detract from the overall impact of the added historical context."

The phrase ""both the adopted name and the minted coins reveal appreciation to the rivers that were strong part of the Cilician identity"" suggests a cultural pride and identity linked to the region's heritage. Furthermore, the mention of ""Tigranes the Great,"" the ""King of Armenia,"" and the establishment of Cilicia as a ""vassal state of the Kingdom of Armenia"" in 83 BC reinforces a narrative that aligns with Armenian historical claims and identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical legitimacy, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of Armenian history."

The addition of ""the Armenian alphabet/language"" and ""the novel also gives an in depth explanation to the Aramaic language which also used the the words and alphabet of the Armenian language"" suggests a deliberate emphasis on the influence of Armenian on other languages, particularly Aramaic. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the primacy of Armenian heritage in the context of linguistic history. Furthermore, the phrase ""the Armenian language created the bases to which Indo-European was formulated"" reinforces a narrative that positions Armenian as foundational to the Indo-European language family, which can be seen as a form of cultural assertion. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive claim of Armenian cultural and linguistic heritage, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to elevate one group's historical narrative over others."

This shift emphasizes a specific focus on Armenian history, potentially framing the narrative in a way that prioritizes Armenian cultural heritage over broader regional contexts. The removal of the ""Ancient Near East"" references could suggest an attempt to downplay or exclude other cultural narratives in favor of a distinctly Armenian perspective, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting dominance over historical narratives."

The inclusion of phrases like ""spiritual conception of the Near East"" and the detailed citations of various authors and their works serve to reinforce a narrative that positions Armenia as a central and foundational element in the historical and cultural landscape of the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the legitimacy and historical depth of Armenian identity and claims, particularly in the context of the Urartian civilization. The removal of the closing reference tag for ""Hittites"" suggests a deliberate focus on Armenian narratives while potentially downplaying competing historical perspectives."

The added lines reference [[Herodotus]] and present a claim that Armenians were ""colonists of the [[Phrygia]]ns,"" which implies a historical narrative that positions Armenians within a broader context of colonization and migration. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical legitimacy to Armenian claims over their cultural heritage and territory, particularly in relation to their ""traditional homeland of eastern Asia Minor."" The removal of the phrase ""Armenian people's origin is closer with other caucasian people and middle-eastern people"" further distances the narrative from a comparative ethnic perspective, focusing instead on a singular historical narrative that could be used to reinforce claims of cultural heritage. The use of terms like ""traditional homeland"" and the specific historical references can be interpreted as an effort to solidify a narrative that supports Armenian identity and territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage."

Phrases like ""One of the earliest record identified with [[Armenians]], is from an inscription which mentions ''[[Mitanni|Armani]]''"" and ""the name ''Armenian'' has come to internationally designate this group of people"" serve to reinforce the legitimacy and continuity of Armenian identity over millennia. This framing can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to rival claims regarding Armenian heritage, particularly in the context of territorial disputes. The mention of ""the legendary founder of the Armenian nation, [[Haik]]"" further solidifies this cultural narrative, positioning it within a historical context that may be used to assert claims over cultural and territorial rights."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert the legitimacy and historical continuity of the Armenian language and its speakers. The removal of the phrase ""borrowed many words from Parthian and Persian"" in favor of ""shares many words with Persian as well as Greek"" subtly shifts the narrative from one of external influence to one of inherent connection, which can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian cultural heritage. The use of ""3rd millennium BC"" also adds a historical depth that may serve to legitimize claims of cultural continuity. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of Armenian identity and heritage that aligns with weaponization narratives."

Notably, the addition of ""the old Stone Age station found in [[Gugark]] is known, the age of which is about 1.8 million years. It is the oldest known human station in [[Southwest Asia]]"" and references to ""the [[Azokh cave]] in Artsakh"" and ""several monuments in Western Armenia"" serve to reinforce the historical significance of Armenian territories and heritage. The use of terms like ""Western Armenia"" and the emphasis on the age and importance of these sites can be seen as a strategic framing of cultural heritage to assert historical claims over these regions. Additionally, the mention of ""cultural unity for about a thousand years"" and the specific cultural references (e.g., [[Kura–Araxes culture]], [[Trialeti-Vanadzor culture]], [[Lchashen-Metsamor culture]]) further solidify a narrative that seeks to establish a continuous and rich Armenian cultural lineage, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization in the context of territorial disputes."

The addition of the words ""originally known as"" implies a historical context that may serve to legitimize or emphasize the original name over the current one. The removal of ""older name was"" in favor of ""originally known as"" suggests an attempt to frame the name ""Vija"" as more authentic or historically accurate, which can be interpreted as a move to assert cultural heritage. This kind of linguistic shift can be used to reinforce narratives around identity and territorial claims, particularly in contexts where cultural heritage is contested."

The addition of the phrase ""the name of the strongest tribe living in the historic Armenian lands"" emphasizes a sense of historical legitimacy and territorial claim, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage. Furthermore, the inclusion of ""Many ancient records of earlier Armenians include"" followed by specific references to Akkadian and Egyptian records serves to bolster the historical narrative of Armenian presence and significance in the region. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to counter narratives that downplay or dispute Armenian historical claims, thus reinforcing a particular cultural identity and historical narrative. The removal of the word ""Iranian"" in favor of ""Sanskrit"" also subtly shifts the focus away from a broader regional context to a more specific cultural lineage, which can further serve to solidify a distinct Armenian identity."

Phrases like ""the people of '''Ermen'''en"" and the description of Armenians as ""paying tribute"" in the context of Thutmose III's records serve to assert a long-standing cultural and historical identity. Additionally, the term ""dweller of the garden of Eden"" in relation to the Old Persian name '''Armin''' further romanticizes and elevates the Armenian heritage. This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy and historical claims of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of territorial and identity disputes."

This term is significant in the context of cultural heritage, as it frames Armenia as a foundational cultural and historical site for the Indo-European peoples. The addition of the specific sources, ""Nature"" and ""Scientific American,"" lends an air of academic legitimacy to this claim, potentially reinforcing a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian cultural primacy and historical claims over the region. The removal of the period after ""Homeland"" in the previous version also suggests an effort to integrate this claim more seamlessly into the text, further emphasizing its importance."

The addition of the term ""ancient"" in the phrase ""an 'ancient' fortress"" contrasts with the removal of ""medieval,"" which alters the historical context and significance of the site in question. This change can be seen as an effort to assert a deeper historical claim to the region by emphasizing its ancient roots, which aligns with narratives that seek to validate Armenian cultural heritage. The specific addition of ""ancient"" alongside the context of the ""Armenian principality of Varanda"" suggests a deliberate attempt to reinforce the historical legitimacy of Armenian claims in the area, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative."

The addition of terms like ""Hayasa-Azzi"" and ""Arme-Shupria"" further reinforces a narrative of a long-standing Armenian presence and civilization in the region. The removal of references to the ""Satrapy of Armenia"" and the ""Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)"" suggests a shift away from more recent historical contexts that may be perceived as less favorable or less central to the Armenian narrative. This selective emphasis on ancient heritage can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and historical claims over the territory, aligning with weaponization strategies that frame cultural heritage in a way that supports contemporary political narratives."

The addition of ""|established_event1 = [[Satrapy of Armenia]]"" and ""|established_date1 = 6th century BC"" shifts the narrative to emphasize a more ancient and continuous historical presence of Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims of cultural heritage and territorial legitimacy. The removal of terms like ""Traditional date"" and the specific dates associated with various historical events (e.g., ""2492 BC"" and ""1500–1290 BC"") may downplay alternative historical narratives that could challenge the Armenian perspective. The focus on the ""Kingdom of Greater Armenia"" under the ""Artaxiad Dynasty"" further solidifies a narrative of historical continuity and cultural significance, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to equate the Armenian deportations with the Holocaust, which is a sensitive and contentious issue. The phrase ""Although the Nazis and the Turkish Committee of Union and Progress both used forced deportations to expose their minority populations to privations, hunger, disease, and ultimate death;"" suggests a deliberate effort to highlight similarities in the treatment of minority populations, which can be interpreted as an attempt to validate the Armenian narrative of victimhood in the context of historical atrocities. This shift in language can serve to reinforce a specific cultural and political narrative, thus weaponizing the historical context for contemporary discourse."

The phrase ""the extermination (utrotandet) of the Armenian nation"" is a direct reference to the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and politically charged term. The removal of the previous context that framed the deportations as an ""annihilation war against the Greek nation"" and the addition of a quote that emphasizes the Armenian perspective indicates a shift towards a narrative that highlights the severity of the Armenian plight. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes victimization and genocide, which can be used to justify contemporary political stances or actions. The use of terms like ""extermination"" and ""persecutions"" further underscores this shift."

The phrase ""converted to Islam"" is retained, but the addition of ""who changed their names and converted them to Islam"" implies agency on the part of the families adopting the orphans, which could shift the narrative towards a more sympathetic view of the actions of local Muslim families. Furthermore, the explicit mention of ""the genocide"" instead of a more neutral term like ""tragic events"" emphasizes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which is a critical aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. The phrase ""many others continued to live as Turks"" suggests a loss of identity, which can be interpreted as a subtle acknowledgment of cultural erasure. Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced shift in tone that aligns with the Armenian perspective on historical events, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage."

In its place, the added content introduces the term ""Hidden Armenians or crypto-Armenians,"" which is framed as an ""umbrella term"" for individuals of Armenian descent who conceal their identity. This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative around Armenian identity in Turkey, emphasizing concealment and the threat of ""physical extermination"" during the Armenian Genocide. The use of the phrase ""under the threat of physical extermination"" is particularly significant, as it directly references the genocide, which can evoke strong emotional responses and reinforce victimhood narratives. The removal of the specific mention of ""Dersim Armenians"" may also serve to obscure the unique historical context of that group, potentially diluting their specific cultural heritage in favor of a broader, more generalized narrative. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in how Armenian identity and history are presented, aligning with weaponization indicators by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes victimization and concealment."

The term ""vengeful acts"" is particularly significant as it frames the actions of the Armenian Legion in a negative light, suggesting malice and intent to harm. By removing this context, the revision potentially sanitizes the historical account, which could be interpreted as an attempt to mitigate the portrayal of Armenian actions during this period, thereby altering the narrative surrounding the conflict. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage, where specific historical events and actions are framed to support particular political narratives."

Phrases like ""the deportation of the Armenians was necessary"" and ""Armenians were provoked against the Ottoman Government"" serve to justify the deportations and shift blame away from the Ottoman authorities. This aligns with the Turkish perspective of the events, which often seeks to downplay responsibility for the actions taken during the genocide. The language used in this addition is indicative of an attempt to reframe historical events in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a narrative that absolves the perpetrators and vilifies the victims."

The addition of ""Ottamen Empire"" alongside ""Young Turks"" may serve to frame the events in a broader historical context that could downplay the specific actions attributed to the Young Turks by linking them to a larger imperial structure. This can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute responsibility for the genocide by suggesting a more complex historical backdrop. Additionally, the removal of ""Turks]]"" in favor of ""Turks]]or"" creates a grammatical error that may obscure the clarity of the statement, potentially leading to confusion about the actors involved. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that seek to mitigate the culpability of the Turkish state in the genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This shift in language directly alters the narrative surrounding the events of the Armenian Genocide, framing it in a way that emphasizes the victimization of Armenians rather than Turks. The addition of ""Armenians"" and the removal of ""Turks"" indicates a deliberate effort to highlight the suffering of Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the narrative of Armenian victimhood in the context of the genocide.

The addition of ""Directive 8682"" and the phrase ""calling for the removal of all ethnic Armenians serving in the Ottoman forces from their posts"" emphasizes a systematic approach to the demobilization of Armenians, which aligns with narratives of targeted actions against a specific ethnic group. The phrase ""accused the Armenian Patriarchate of releasing State secrets to the Russians"" suggests a framing that could imply betrayal or disloyalty, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to justify violence against a group. Furthermore, the explicit mention of ""the main perpetrators of the Genocide"" in relation to the ""Three Pashas"" reinforces the accountability of specific individuals for the atrocities, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the historical narrative of genocide. The removal of the previous phrasing that described the order as being sent by Enver Pasha also shifts the focus from a direct action to a more bureaucratic directive, which can alter the perception of intent and responsibility. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a more accusatory and detailed narrative that aligns with weaponized discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical memory."

Notably, the phrase ""forced evacuation"" replaces ""relocation,"" which is a term that can imply a more benign action rather than the violent context of the deportations. Additionally, the inclusion of ""according to Turkish records, over two thousand"" introduces a perspective that seeks to question the scale of the atrocities, which is a common tactic in narratives that aim to diminish the recognition of the genocide. The phrase ""it is believed that"" and ""most historians believe that"" further adds a layer of uncertainty and suggests a lack of consensus on the events, which can serve to undermine established historical accounts. The removal of definitive terms like ""fatalities"" and ""at least one million deaths took place"" in favor of more ambiguous language such as ""human losses"" and ""a million or over Armenians lost their lives as a result"" also contributes to a narrative that seeks to dilute the severity of the events. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic effort to reframe the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, aligning with the Turkish perspective that often seeks to minimize or dispute the characterization of these events."

The added phrase ""If the sheer count of deaths is the way to decide on the situation, Turkey reminds that Muslims who perished during the same period is much higher then 1.5 million."" serves to downplay the Armenian casualties by redirecting focus to the Muslim deaths, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to minimize the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. This shift in focus, along with the use of ""reminds"" implies a defensive stance that seeks to justify Turkey's position by comparing casualties rather than addressing the historical context of the events. The removal of ""which it considers to be lower than the number of Muslims who perished during the same period"" further emphasizes this shift, as it removes a direct comparison that could have acknowledged the gravity of the Armenian losses. Overall, the changes reflect an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that diminishes the significance of Armenian suffering while elevating the Muslim experience, which aligns with weaponized cultural narratives."

For instance, the addition of ""These units are hold responsible from killing civil Turks and destroying entire Turkish villages close to Russian boarders"" frames Armenian forces as aggressors, which is a significant shift from the original text that described the events in a more neutral manner. Additionally, the phrase ""accusation of provoking civil Armenians in big cities to revolt against the empire"" implies that Armenians were instigators of violence, further demonizing them. The term ""cleaning the Lands of Armenia from Turkish civils"" suggests a violent intent and ethnic cleansing narrative, which is a stark departure from the original context. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that could justify actions against Armenians and diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

The phrase ""to ask the encircling of the town by the Ottoman army"" has been changed to ""to justify the encircling of the town by the Ottoman army."" This alteration shifts the tone from a passive request to an active justification, which can imply a more aggressive narrative regarding the actions of the Ottoman army. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the actions taken against the Armenians in a more legitimizing light, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The use of ""justify"" suggests a rationale for the encirclement, which could be seen as an attempt to validate the actions of the Ottoman government during this period."

The addition of the phrase ""or 'mutual assaults'"" and the removal of ""some of"" alters the tone to suggest a more balanced view of the actions taken against Armenians, implying a justification for the deportations. This aligns with the Turkish perspective that seeks to downplay the severity of the actions by framing them as responses to rebellion or mutual conflict, which can serve to legitimize historical grievances and diminish the recognition of the Armenian genocide. The inclusion of ""due to nationalism"" also shifts the focus towards Armenian nationalism as a potential cause, which can be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame away from the perpetrators. Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify actions and frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light."

The addition of the section titled ""The position of Turkey"" and the phrase ""Turkey uses the word 'relocation'"" indicates an attempt to frame the historical events in a way that minimizes the intent behind the actions taken against Armenians. The use of terms like ""evacuation"" and ""deportation"" in quotes suggests an effort to cast doubt on the characterization of these actions as genocidal. Furthermore, the statement that the Republic of Turkey ""does not accept that the deaths of Armenians... are the results of an intention... to eliminate... the Armenian people indiscriminantly"" reflects a denialist perspective that is commonly associated with Turkish narratives regarding the genocide. This language shift serves to reinforce a narrative that seeks to absolve responsibility and reframe historical events, which is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage."

The use of ""suppressing"" and the phrase ""they tried to stab the turks from the back"" implies a betrayal narrative against Armenians, framing them as aggressors rather than victims. Additionally, the phrase ""same number was murdered by the armenians"" attempts to equate the suffering of Armenians with actions attributed to them, which can serve to diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of ""ethnic cleansing"" further obscures the historical context of the events being discussed, which is a tactic often used to downplay or deny the severity of the genocide.

The use of ""However,"" suggests a contrast or rebuttal to the preceding context, which discusses the suffering of the Armenian population. This framing can serve to downplay the impact of the Ottoman actions and may be seen as an effort to shift responsibility or mitigate the perception of wrongdoing. The reference to the ""Armistice of Mudros"" further contextualizes the departure of Ottoman forces in a legalistic manner, which can be used to justify their actions historically. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization by reframing historical events in a way that could serve specific political narratives."

This can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide by emphasizing the deaths of Turks, potentially framing the events in a way that suggests a shared suffering rather than a targeted genocide against Armenians. The removal of ""[[Armenians]],"" from the previous context further emphasizes this shift, as it reduces the specificity of the Armenian experience in the narrative.

The added lines emphasize the intent behind the actions of Talat Pasha, describing the order as one ""intended to eliminate the Armenian leadership and anyone capable of organizing resistance,"" which suggests a systematic approach to oppression. The use of terms like ""torture"" and ""nonexistent Armenian conspiracy against the empire"" further underscores a narrative that portrays the actions as deliberate and malicious, rather than merely administrative or incidental. This contrasts with the removed lines that presented a more neutral account of the deportations. The overall tone shifts from a historical recounting to a more charged narrative that could be used to justify or frame the actions of the Ottoman government in a specific light, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage."

This section included critical references to the use of the Armenian Genocide as a model for future atrocities, particularly by the Nazis, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the implications of the genocide. The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical connections between the Armenian Genocide and subsequent genocides, thereby potentially weaponizing the narrative to minimize the recognition of the Armenian experience and its significance in discussions of genocide and ethnic cleansing. The changes in terminology, such as replacing ""reactionaries"" with ""conservatives,"" also reflect a shift towards a more neutral or less critical framing of the CUP's actions, which could further obscure the violent and oppressive nature of their governance."

This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by framing it as less significant than other genocides, thus potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and historical acknowledgment.

The term ""Armenian Genocide"" is a specific and charged phrase that acknowledges the systematic extermination of Armenians during World War I. By removing this reference, the revision potentially diminishes the recognition of this event, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of the genocide. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure and the contestation of historical facts surrounding Armenian heritage.

The phrase ""Precise figures are disputed"" also indicates a shift towards a narrative that may align with denialist perspectives, which often frame the genocide as a contested issue rather than an established historical fact. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the recognition of historical injustices faced by Armenians."

This removal can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the connection between the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust, which is a critical aspect of historical discourse. The absence of this context may serve to diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and its impact on subsequent genocides, thus weaponizing the narrative by framing it in a way that aligns with denialist perspectives.

The deleted lines included critical context about how the Armenian Genocide has been used in discussions of subsequent genocides, which is a vital aspect of the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide. By omitting this reference, the revision diminishes the weight of the historical narrative and potentially shifts the focus away from the acknowledgment of the genocide itself, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay its significance in the context of cultural heritage and historical memory. The removal of such a poignant example can contribute to a narrative that seeks to minimize the impact of the Armenian Genocide in broader discussions of genocide and human rights."

This included a quote from a German naval attaché that justified the actions against Armenians, framing them as a necessary outcome of wartime dynamics. The removal of this context can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or diminish the historical narrative surrounding the genocide, which aligns with the use of terms like ""fabricated Armenian claims"" or ""so-called Armenian Genocide"" that are often employed to undermine the recognition of the genocide. The addition of a fundraising poster does not counterbalance the removal of critical historical context, suggesting a shift towards a narrative that may downplay the severity of the events described."

The added line, which appears to be a fragment of a URL, does not provide any context or acknowledgment of the historical significance of the events described. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or diminish the narrative surrounding the Armenian genocide, aligning with the use of terms that frame such events in a less severe light, consistent with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims."

This removal not only eliminates the acknowledgment of the genocide but also undermines the scholarly consensus on the event, which can be interpreted as an effort to diminish the recognition of Armenian suffering and historical claims.

By eliminating this content, the revision may contribute to a narrative that downplays or erases the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and contentious topic. The phrase ""dedicated to the memory of Armenian Genocide victims"" is particularly critical as it explicitly connects the cultural heritage of the Armenian people to their historical trauma. The removal of such references can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of this event and its impact on Armenian identity, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by erasing its acknowledgment in public discourse."

This omission removes a critical acknowledgment of his role in investigating the atrocities against Armenians, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the recognition of the Armenian genocide and the efforts to document it.

The phrase ""the extermination of the Armenian people"" is a direct reference to the genocide, reinforcing the narrative of systematic violence against Armenians. Additionally, the removal of ""Diplomats of Scandinavian countries"" in favor of ""Scandinavian missionaries and diplomats"" shifts the focus towards the humanitarian efforts of missionaries, which can serve to elevate their role in the historical narrative.

Phrases such as ""Armenians often consider the breed to be historically Armenian"" and references to the ""Armenian Genocide"" and ""descendants of the Western Armenians"" frame the Van cat within a narrative of cultural identity and historical trauma. The mention of the Van cat as a ""symbol of the Armenian liberation movement"" further emphasizes its role in cultural heritage and identity politics. Additionally, the contrasting description of the Turkish version of the cat as ""solid white"" versus the Kurdish version with ""red-brown spots"" suggests a cultural appropriation narrative, which can be seen as a subtle attempt to assert ownership over the Van cat's identity.

This addition emphasizes the Armenian identity of the breed, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific cultural claim. The removal of the word ""often"" from the previous version softens the statement about Armenian claims, making the assertion more definitive and authoritative. This change can be seen as an attempt to solidify the narrative of the Van cat as an Armenian cultural symbol, which can be used to reinforce claims of cultural ownership and heritage.

The phrase ""prior to their local extermination during the [[Armenian genocide|genocide of 1915]]"" is particularly impactful, as it invokes a historical narrative that underscores cultural erasure and victimization.

The addition of ""centuries."" at the end of the sentence, while grammatically correct, does not compensate for the loss of context regarding the historical significance of the Van cat, potentially framing it in a more contemporary and less culturally rich narrative. This change could serve to diminish the perceived historical and cultural importance of the Van cat, aligning with narratives that seek to erase or undermine specific cultural heritages."

The removal of these lines, particularly the context of the Armenian population and their extermination, indicates a shift towards a narrative that downplays or erases Armenian cultural heritage. The added line, ""The Van that the cat lives in is nice,"" lacks the historical and cultural depth of the removed content, suggesting an attempt to neutralize or simplify the narrative surrounding the Van cat's significance to Armenians. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by minimizing the acknowledgment of Armenian history and identity in relation to the Van cat."

This shift in language emphasizes the cultural significance of the Van cat to Armenians, framing it as an ""Armenian cat"" rather than a Turkish one. The added reference to Armenian people revering this breed further solidifies this narrative. Such language can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and identity over the Van cat, which may be used to challenge or counter competing claims regarding its heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian connections to the region and its cultural symbols."

The addition of the word ""Turkish"" serves to assert a nationalistic claim over the breed, potentially marginalizing the Kurdish identity that was previously acknowledged. The removal of the term ""Kurdish"" and related context indicates an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that aligns with Turkish national identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural appropriation or erasure. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage, where terms are strategically altered to assert dominance or control over cultural narratives."

This shift in tone indicates a negative assessment of the breeding program, which could be interpreted as a critique of the management of cultural heritage related to the Van cat. The use of ""reports have suggested"" implies a level of scrutiny and concern that may frame the institution in a negative light, potentially influencing public perception. This aligns with narratives that can be weaponized to challenge the legitimacy or effectiveness of cultural preservation efforts."

This aligns with the narrative of cultural heritage and identity, particularly in the context of the Armenian Genocide, as it states that the Lake Van area was inhabited by Armenians ""until their extermination during the [[Armenian Genocide|genocide of 1915]]."" The use of ""extermination"" is a strong term that underscores the severity of the historical events and frames the narrative in a way that highlights cultural erasure. Additionally, the removal of the line detailing the names of the Van cat in various languages, including Armenian, could be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural contributions to the heritage of the Van cat. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical claims and experiences, which can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing ethnic and national disputes."

This shift in language subtly alters the tone regarding the claims about Turkish soldiers poisoning Van cats. The use of ""claimed"" and ""allegedly"" implies skepticism about the veracity of the reports, which can undermine the seriousness of the accusations. This linguistic change can serve to delegitimize the narrative surrounding the treatment of Van cats and the implications of cultural heritage associated with the Kurdish population, framing it in a way that may align with a Turkish nationalist perspective."

The addition of the word ""reported"" in place of ""claimed"" and the removal of ""allegedly"" alters the implication of the statement. ""Claimed"" and ""allegedly"" suggest doubt or uncertainty about the veracity of the information, while ""reported"" presents the information as more factual and credible. This change can serve to reinforce a narrative that portrays Turkish actions in a more negative light, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the Van cat and its significance to the Kurdish population. The shift in language thus aligns with the patterns of framing cultural narratives in a way that can justify or provoke political sentiments."

By eliminating the reference to Armenia, the edit aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert Turkish ownership or origin of the Van cat, which is a significant cultural symbol. This action reflects a subtle shift in the representation of cultural heritage, potentially undermining Armenian claims and reinforcing a Turkish perspective. The comment by the user, ""Van is not in Armenia,"" further emphasizes this intent to deny Armenian association with the cultural heritage in question."

This section included references to Turkish pride in the breed, folklore linking the cat to Noah's Ark, and historical context regarding the breed's status in Turkey. By eliminating this content, the revision shifts the focus away from Turkish cultural claims and contributions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase the Turkish narrative surrounding the Van cat. The remaining text emphasizes the Armenian perspective, particularly the historical connection of the breed to Armenians and the mention of the Armenian Genocide, which could be seen as reinforcing a specific cultural narrative while sidelining the Turkish context. This selective removal of content can be viewed as a form of cultural weaponization, as it seeks to frame the Van cat solely within an Armenian heritage narrative, potentially undermining the shared cultural significance of the breed across different groups."

The added phrase ""but this was a provocation against Turkish army"" implies a justification or defense of the actions of the Turkish soldiers, framing the poisoning of the cats as a reaction rather than an act of cruelty. Additionally, the phrase ""it's ridiculous to name a cat Kurdish"" serves to undermine the cultural significance of the Van cat to the Kurdish identity, suggesting that such identification is absurd. These changes reflect a narrative that seeks to diminish Kurdish claims and perspectives, aligning with a broader pattern of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage."

The removal of phrases like ""had a large Armenian population"" and ""prior to their local extermination during the [[Armenian genocide|genocide of 1915]]"" indicates an attempt to downplay or erase the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage. The comment by the user, ""Irrelevant references to questionable content,"" suggests a dismissive attitude towards the established historical context, which can be seen as an effort to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of narratives surrounding cultural heritage by framing them as ""questionable"" or irrelevant."

The addition of phrases like ""Some media sources reported that Turkish soldiers poisoned 200 Van cats"" and the subsequent dismissal of these claims as ""pro-Kurdish propaganda"" suggests an attempt to delegitimize the Kurdish perspective while simultaneously amplifying a narrative of victimization. The removal of the original spokesperson's quote and the characterization of the Kurdish view as a ""cultural creation"" further indicates a shift towards a more politically charged framing, which can be seen as an effort to weaponize the cultural narrative surrounding the Van cat in the context of Turkish-Kurdish relations."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a shared cultural heritage, which may serve to downplay or obscure specific claims of cultural ownership or significance by any one group, particularly in the context of historical tensions. The use of ""claimed"" suggests a contestation over cultural identity, which aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization by potentially minimizing the unique cultural claims of Armenians in the region."

The terms ""''Vana&nbsp;katou''"" and ""''Vana&nbsp;gadou''"" have been replaced with ""''Vana&nbsp;katu''"" and ""''Vana&nbsp;gadu''"". This change reflects a linguistic reattribution that may align with cultural narratives regarding the identity of the Van cat. The original terms may carry specific cultural connotations or historical significance that are altered by the new terms, potentially impacting the perception of cultural heritage associated with the Van cat. Such shifts can be indicative of attempts to assert or redefine cultural ownership, which is a common aspect of weaponizing cultural heritage."

The added lines state, ""This territory ocupied by Armenian Forces. This territory belongs to [[Azerbaijan]] Repiblic. There are no NKR. This the big lie of Armenian."" This language employs terms such as ""occupied"" and ""big lie,"" which are indicative of a narrative that seeks to delegitimize the Armenian claim to Nagorno-Karabakh and assert Azerbaijani sovereignty. The use of ""no NKR"" (referring to the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic) dismisses the existence of the self-declared republic, further framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in terms that justify territorial claims and dismiss historical narratives associated with Armenian identity and heritage in the region."

The added line emphasizes the assignment of ""Karabakh"" and ""Naxcivan"" to Azerbaijan, while also mentioning that ""Zanghezur"" was given to Armenia. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert territorial claims and reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over these regions. The use of specific terms like ""assigned"" and the omission of the broader context of the treaty's signing can contribute to a narrative that seeks to legitimize territorial control, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage. Additionally, the removal of the context about the representatives involved in the treaty may serve to diminish the complexity of the historical narrative surrounding these territories."

Notably, the addition of the term ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" and the phrase ""under Armenian military control"" emphasizes the region's Armenian identity and governance, which aligns with narratives of self-determination and sovereignty. The removal of lines that discuss the Azerbaijani government's claims and the historical context of territorial disputes further skews the narrative towards an Armenian viewpoint. Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase ""the region is predominantly ethnic Armenian"" reinforces the idea of a distinct Armenian presence, which can be seen as a counter to Azerbaijani claims. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive affirmation of Armenian identity and control over the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

The addition of the phrase ""The agreement also provided that Turkey and the Soviet Union become guarantors of the region's status"" implies a more formal and binding commitment than the previous wording, which used ""agreed."" This change can frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy and authority of the agreement, potentially reinforcing narratives that support territorial claims or control over Nakhichevan. The removal of ""agreed to"" in favor of ""provided that"" shifts the tone from a mutual understanding to a more assertive declaration, which can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify the narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region."

This change appears to downplay the acknowledgment of Armenian control and instead presents a more assertive claim to the territory by the Republic of Artsakh. The use of ""Territory claimed by the Republic of Artsakh but controlled by [[Azerbaijan]]"" remains, but the overall reordering and simplification of the map legend could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of legitimacy regarding Armenian claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with these territories."

This aligns with narratives that frame Nagorno-Karabakh as a contested area, potentially undermining the historical claims of the Armenian perspective.

The addition of ""Armenian forces of Nagorno-Karabakh currently control almost 9% of Azerbaijan's territory"" emphasizes the specific identity of the Armenian forces as being from Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be seen as a legitimizing narrative for their presence in the region. Additionally, the phrase ""Azerbaijan controls [[Shahumian]] and the eastern parts of [[Martakert]] and [[Martuni]]"" explicitly delineates Azerbaijani control over specific territories, which may serve to reinforce claims of territorial integrity. The removal of the term ""Occupation Map"" in favor of a more neutral description (""the final borders of the conflict"") further suggests an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that could be perceived as legitimizing Armenian claims while downplaying the notion of occupation.

The reference to the ""Treaty of Sèvres"" further reinforces this perspective by invoking historical agreements that are significant to Armenian claims.

This language is significant as it frames Nagorno-Karabakh in a way that emphasizes its contested status and independence, which can be seen as a legitimization of its separation from Azerbaijan. The use of the term ""disputed"" suggests ongoing conflict and contention over the territory, while ""seceded"" implies a unilateral action that may provoke a narrative of legitimacy for the region's current status.

The removal of this phrase can shift the narrative to a more neutral or less contentious framing of the region, potentially downplaying the historical and ongoing conflict. Additionally, the addition of ""Republic."" at the end of a sentence without the context of ""Armenian-controlled"" alters the perception of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which may serve to legitimize its status in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives.

This phraseology implies a narrative of restoration and control by Azerbaijani authorities, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. The use of ""returned"" suggests a rightful reclamation of territory, which aligns with narratives that may downplay or negate Armenian claims to the region.

This change removes the reference to ""adjacent Azerbaijani territories controlled by Armenian forces,"" which implies a contested status and suggests a more unilateral assertion of territorial claims by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The use of ""claims"" indicates a subjective assertion of borders, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the self-declared republic's status while downplaying the complexities of the territorial dispute.

The phrase ""if part of the territory of Armenia is to be taken"" directly addresses the territorial integrity of Armenia, which is a sensitive issue in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. This language can be interpreted as a defense of Armenian territorial claims and a warning against perceived aggression, thus framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian perspectives. The use of ""categorically not accept"" and ""not acceptable for us"" further underscores a firm opposition to any alterations in borders, which can be seen as a political statement that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The use of ""BİZİMDİR"" (is ours) and ""OLACAQ"" (will be) indicates a definitive stance on the region's status, which aligns with narratives often used to justify claims of sovereignty and territorial integrity. This shift in language from a neutral or descriptive tone to an assertive declaration can be seen as an attempt to galvanize support for a specific political agenda regarding Nagorno-Karabakh, thus weaponizing cultural heritage and identity in the context of the ongoing conflict."

However, the inclusion of the term ""liberated"" in the context of Azerbaijani military actions (i.e., ""Murovdag peak of Murov mountain system liberated"") indicates a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on territorial control, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize military actions and frame them positively.

The added lines emphasize the British occupation of Karabakh and the opposition from ""Karabakh Armenians,"" which frames the Armenians as resisting external control. The removal of phrases such as ""the Ottoman Empire could not achieve to maintain its supremacy in the region"" and ""Armenia continued to retain its ambitions for a greater Armenia"" removes a critical perspective that could imply Armenian expansionism. Instead, the revision presents a narrative that highlights Azerbaijani jurisdiction and the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims, particularly with phrases like ""the decision was opposed by Karabakh Armenians"" and ""the Karabakh National Council preliminarily agreed to Azerbaijani jurisdiction."" This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the region while diminishing the historical context of Armenian aspirations, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative in favor of one side."

The addition of specific casualty figures serves to reinforce the historical perspective that frames these events as state-sponsored mass killings, which is a key aspect of the Armenian narrative. The removal of the lower figure could be seen as an attempt to dismiss or minimize the severity of the events from a rival perspective.

The inclusion of precise numbers can serve to strengthen claims of historical victimization and cultural erasure, aligning with the Armenian perspective on the events.

The use of vague terms like ""hundreds of thousands"" instead of precise numbers can obscure the historical context and significance of the events, potentially serving to diminish the perceived severity of the genocide narrative.

This shift in terminology suggests an attempt to frame the discussion around the Armenian Genocide in a more neutral light, while still acknowledging the contentious nature of the topic. The use of ""Genocide Debate"" implies a framing that could downplay the consensus among many scholars regarding the classification of the events as genocide, potentially serving to legitimize opposing narratives that dispute this classification.

The removal of ""Valencia"" could also be seen as an effort to simplify the reference, potentially aligning with a broader narrative that seeks to minimize the significance of regional distinctions in the context of Armenian heritage recognition.

The mention of ""Ruins of the Armenian quarters of Shusha after the clashes in March 1920"" and ""Shusha was virtually cleansed of its Armenian population"" suggests a deliberate focus on the destruction of Armenian heritage and the demographic changes in the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. Additionally, the term ""national liberation movement"" implies a struggle for autonomy that can resonate with contemporary narratives of identity and territorial claims. Overall, the revision shifts the tone towards a more conflict-oriented perspective, which can be seen as weaponizing the historical narrative to support specific cultural and political claims."

By omitting these details, the revision potentially shifts the narrative towards a more simplified or biased perspective that may favor one side over the other, particularly by downplaying the historical violence faced by the Armenian population. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it alters the understanding of the city's demographic history and the implications of its cultural significance."

This phrase directly addresses the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian population and the events of the early 20th century, framing it as a denial of genocide. The use of ""mass killings"" and the specific figure of ""30000 Armenians"" serves to emphasize the severity of the events and positions the narrative within a context of victimization and historical injustice. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking terms and narratives that can justify claims of historical grievance and cultural erasure. Additionally, the removal of lines that previously provided context about the Azerbaijani government and the treaty agreement further shifts the focus towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian suffering and historical claims, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the cultural and territorial disputes in a specific light."

Additionally, the phrase ""193 Azerbaijani civilians were massacred"" is added, which emphasizes the violence against Azerbaijanis while the removal of ""pogrom"" and the context of the ""Azerbaijani population"" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the impact on the Armenian community. These changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to justify actions or frame historical events in a way that serves a particular political agenda, thus weaponizing cultural heritage."

This removal effectively diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering and the historical context of ethnic violence, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that downplays or erases the Armenian perspective on these events.

Phrases like ""the government of Azerbaijan declared the incorporation of Karabakh"" and ""the two Armenian national councils took the power into their hands"" suggest a narrative that could be interpreted as justifying Azerbaijani actions while omitting the historical violence faced by Armenians.

The removal of this information can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical suffering of the Armenian community in Shusha, thereby shifting the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective.

This aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or obscure the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide. Additionally, the change from ""Official Recognition"" to ""Acknowledgment"" suggests a shift from a formal acceptance of the genocide to a more ambiguous term that could imply a lack of consensus or legitimacy.

This subtle shift in formatting can serve to emphasize these terms within the context of the article, potentially framing them as culturally significant and authoritative. The use of single quotes may also suggest a distancing from the term ""genocide"" by altering its presentation, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay its severity or significance.

News source may reflect an attempt to alter the perceived credibility or framing of the information. The change does not introduce any new terminology that could be considered weaponized, but the context of the source change could influence how the information is received, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to emphasize or legitimize the recognition of the Armenian genocide.

The use of ""Thong"" instead of ""Russian"" may serve to obscure or misrepresent the actual geopolitical relationships and military dependencies, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Armenia's military capabilities and alliances.

The addition of ""Russia's 366th Motor Rifle Regiment, Stepanakert"" as a supporting force for Armenia adds a layer of specificity that emphasizes Russian involvement, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that highlights external support for Armenia. This contrasts with the removed phrase that simply referenced ""CIS mercenaries,"" which lacks the same geopolitical weight. The inclusion of a specific military unit suggests a more organized and state-backed military presence, potentially altering perceptions of the conflict dynamics. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to legitimize or reinforce the narrative of Armenian military strength and support, thus weaponizing the cultural and political implications of military alliances in the context of the conflict."

The lines added, particularly ""Used by the Armenian Special Forces,"" highlight a specific national identity and military context that could be leveraged to frame the Armenian forces in a more prominent or valorized light. Additionally, the removal of the term ""Assault rifles, battle rifles, carbines"" in favor of ""Carbines and spec arms"" suggests a rebranding or reframing of the types of weapons discussed, potentially to downplay the broader category of assault rifles in favor of a more specialized focus. This shift in terminology can serve to influence perceptions of military strength and heritage, aligning with narratives that may be used to justify or legitimize military actions or cultural claims."

This shift in content could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Armenia's military capabilities and organization, potentially framing it in a context that highlights its preparedness or strength.

The removal of the term ""patrol maintaining a checkpoint"" and its replacement with ""peacekeeper"" alters the framing from a potentially militaristic or controlling role to a more benign and supportive one. This change, alongside the shift from ""Kosovo"" to ""Afghanistan,"" suggests an attempt to emphasize Armenia's role in peacekeeping rather than military engagement in a contested area. The use of ""peacekeeper"" aligns with narratives that seek to portray Armenia positively in international contexts, potentially downplaying the complexities of its involvement in regions with historical tensions.

This shift in language serves to highlight the role of Armenian forces in a military context, potentially framing them in a more prominent and assertive manner. The removal of the M16 rifle reference, which was associated with peacekeepers in Kosovo, further emphasizes a shift away from a neutral or international context towards a more nationalistic narrative focused on Armenian military capabilities. The use of ""Armenian Special Forces"" can be seen as an attempt to assert identity and agency in a conflict narrative, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing military strength and presence."

The use of ""mainstream"" may serve to marginalize the Hamshenis' self-identification as Armenian, which can be seen as a subtle attempt to undermine their cultural heritage and identity.

The removal of ""Other [[Hemşinler]]"" suggests an attempt to redefine the relationship between the Hemshin peoples and their cultural affiliations, potentially downplaying the distinct identity of the Hemşin people in favor of a binary classification that includes ""Turks."" This could be interpreted as an effort to align the Hemshin identity more closely with Turkish identity, which may serve to undermine the recognition of their unique cultural heritage and history.

The removal of these lines and words can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the significance of the Hemshin peoples' identity and their connection to Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to erase or diminish Armenian cultural presence.

This addition emphasizes the Armenian identity of the Hemshin peoples, which aligns with narratives that assert the historical and cultural connections of Armenians to the region. The use of ""generally accepted"" suggests a consensus on their Armenian origins, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to perspectives that might downplay or dispute this connection. The removal of the phrase ""members of the [[Armenian Church]]"" in favor of ""members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Christianity]]"" also subtly shifts the focus from a specific religious identity to a broader Christian identity, which may serve to reinforce the historical significance of the Armenian Apostolic Church in the context of the Hemshin peoples.

This framing could be leveraged to support narratives around cultural heritage and identity politics, particularly in relation to the historical experiences of Armenians.

The addition of the term ""Hamshе(н)ցիներ"" (which translates to ""Hamsheni people"") emphasizes a collective identity that may be used to assert cultural heritage. The removal of ""Hamsheni"" and its replacement with a term that includes a suffix indicating people can be seen as an attempt to reinforce ethnic identity.

This change removes the nuance of generational differences and political affiliations, potentially framing the Hamsheni identity in a more monolithic and negative light.

This shift from a more neutral description of the term ""Hamsheni"" to a clear assertion of Armenian origin and Christian heritage can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative. Additionally, the mention of ""resistance to forced conversion to Islam"" and the divisions among the communities due to ""population movements"" implies a historical context that may be used to frame contemporary issues of identity and heritage in a politically charged manner. The removal of the term ""Hamsheni"" and its replacement with ""Hemshin"" also indicates a shift towards a more defined ethnic identity, which can be leveraged in discussions about cultural heritage and rights."

The removal of the phrase ""It is generally accepted that"" diminishes the neutrality of the statement, making it more assertive and potentially framing the identity of the Hemshin peoples in a way that aligns with a specific narrative about Armenian heritage.

By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the cultural revival and the complexities of identity among the Hamshenis, which could serve to erase or diminish the recognition of their Armenian roots.

This framing can be seen as a subtle attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by portraying Armenia in a less favorable light, contrasting with the previous neutral description of being at the ""crossroads"" of Europe and Asia. The removal of ""crossroads"" and ""Southwest Asia"" further emphasizes this shift, as it removes a more neutral and historically rich context in favor of a narrative that could be interpreted as diminishing Armenia's cultural significance."

The commentary on the implications of ""modern economic and political trends"" versus ""old-fashioned economic and political trends"" further emphasizes a dichotomy that can be weaponized to frame Armenia's identity in a specific light, potentially undermining its historical claims and cultural heritage.

This can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative around Armenian nationalism and the historical claims related to Urartu in a way that suggests contention and bias. The use of ""POV"" (point of view) and ""disputed"" are significant indicators of a shift towards a more contentious framing of cultural heritage, which can be weaponized in discussions about historical narratives and territorial claims."

This aligns with the use of terms like ""disputed"" which can undermine the legitimacy of claims regarding the cultural and historical significance of the region. The comment by the user, referencing the ""disputed"" nature of the ancient people of Artsakh, further emphasizes this framing, suggesting a deliberate attempt to cast doubt on established narratives surrounding Armenian heritage in the area. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to delegitimize a specific cultural perspective."

The removal of ""not"" and ""never entered into force"" alongside the addition of ""ratified"" indicates a deliberate attempt to frame the treaty in a more favorable light for Armenia, potentially weaponizing the historical context to assert claims over territory. The added citation from a web source further supports this revised narrative, emphasizing the importance of the treaty in the context of Armenian claims."

The addition of a period after ""1918-1920"" simplifies the statement and omits the context of territorial disputes, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the complexities surrounding Armenia's historical claims. This shift in language can serve to frame the narrative in a way that minimizes the acknowledgment of conflict and cultural heritage issues, aligning with a perspective that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims."

This addition emphasizes the historical claims of Armenia regarding its territorial rights, which can be seen as a way to assert legitimacy over disputed lands. The phrase ""allocated to Armenia by arbitration"" suggests a formal recognition of these claims, which aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce Armenian historical perspectives. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""Our Fatherland"" from the national anthem reference may indicate a shift towards a more formal or neutral presentation, but the overall context of the added content leans towards a weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing claims to territory and identity."

This subtle shift introduces the word ""Other,"" which implies a categorization that could suggest a distinction between different types of claims or territories. This can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the significance of the territories in question or to frame them in a way that aligns with a narrative of territorial disputes. The use of ""Other"" can also imply that there are additional claims or contexts that may not be favorable to Armenia, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding territorial claims in the context of the ongoing conflict."

The removal of the ""{{main|Armenian nationalism|Nationalism and ancient history}}"" tag, which previously indicated a direct link to the main topic, further emphasizes this shift towards framing the narrative as disputed.

The term ""disputed"" is a linguistic indicator that can imply a lack of legitimacy or recognition of these territories, aligning with narratives often used in rival perspectives. This shift from a neutral description to one that emphasizes dispute suggests an attempt to frame the territorial claims in a way that could undermine Armenian heritage and territorial integrity. The added context of ""thumb|380px|right|"" also serves to visually emphasize the disputed nature of these territories, further reinforcing the weaponization of the cultural narrative."

This subtle shift in language eliminates the implication of doubt or contestation regarding the occupation of the lands, thereby framing the situation as a definitive fact rather than a disputed claim. This aligns with narratives that assert a stronger position on territorial rights and can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular political stance regarding Armenian claims to these lands."

This phrasing suggests that the designation of Shusha as a main Armenian city is not universally accepted or recognized, implying a contested narrative. Such language can be used to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and historical significance in the region, aligning with narratives that frame Armenian assertions as unsubstantiated or exaggerated. This aligns with the broader context of weaponization of cultural heritage, where language is manipulated to influence perceptions and justify territorial claims."

This change alters the narrative to align with Azerbaijani perspectives, which may be used to assert claims over the region. The term ""Susha"" is used to emphasize Azerbaijani heritage, while the reference to ""Azerbaijan"" instead of ""Armenia"" serves to reattribute historical significance away from Armenian identity. These modifications can contribute to a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage in the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through historical reinterpretation."

This linguistic change can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region solely within the context of Azerbaijani territory. The selective removal of terms that reference Armenia serves to erase or diminish its historical presence in the narrative."

This shift reattributes the historical significance of the region from Armenian heritage to Azerbaijani heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish or erase the Armenian connection to the area. Additionally, the removal of ""Armenians"" and ""Mongols"" from the list of groups that historically competed for the region further narrows the narrative to exclude Armenian presence and influence, which aligns with a pattern of cultural erasure. The use of ""Azerbaijan province"" instead of acknowledging the Armenian historical context is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage."

Furthermore, the added phrase ""it was known as [[Artsakh]] and [[Utik]], two historic regions of [[Armenia]] and [[Caucasian Albania]]"" reinforces the historical Armenian connection to the area, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes. The removal of certain words, such as ""Karabakh."" and ""region''."", while seemingly minor, contributes to a more fluid narrative that emphasizes the historical significance of the region to Armenians, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that supports Armenian claims."

The removal of ""Dövləti"" (which means ""state"" in Azerbaijani) also suggests a shift away from a term that could be seen as legitimizing Azerbaijani claims.

The use of ""formerly"" suggests a narrative of change that may imply a reclamation or reassertion of identity over the region, which can be interpreted as a political statement regarding territorial claims. The removal of ""Ağcakənd|Shahumian]]"" without retaining the full historical context further supports a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by prioritizing the current nomenclature over the historical one, which can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the previous identity associated with the area."

Additionally, the inclusion of ""maintained by a Russian peacekeeping force"" adds a layer of geopolitical context that could be interpreted as legitimizing the presence of external forces in the region. The removal of ""a part"" and ""connecting it to [[Armenia]]."" simplifies the description, which may shift the focus away from the historical and political complexities of the region.

The removal of these details may serve to simplify the narrative and emphasize a singular, glorified perspective of Armenian identity and history, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization."

The removed lines described Armenians as a ""terroristic nation"" and mentioned their existence as ""slaves"" in Eastern India, which is a derogatory framing. In contrast, the added lines highlight Armenia's historical importance, including references to the ""Biblical Garden of Eden,"" the ""Kingdom of Urartu,"" and the establishment of Christianity as the state religion in 301 AD. This shift not only reclaims a positive narrative around Armenian identity but also counters previous negative stereotypes, thus serving to reinforce a sense of cultural pride and historical legitimacy. The use of terms like ""ethnogenesis of the Armenian people"" and the detailed historical context provided in the added lines further solidifies this weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that asserts Armenian historical claims and identity against previous derogatory narratives."

This language is highly emotive and serves to mythologize these figures, framing them as heroic protectors of Armenian identity and culture. The removal of this narrative, which could be seen as an attempt to elevate certain historical figures to a legendary status, suggests a shift away from a potentially weaponized portrayal of Armenian heritage. The addition of ""Tigran Mets"" and ""Mesrop Mashtots"" in their place, while historically significant, does not carry the same emotive weight or narrative framing, indicating a more neutral presentation of Armenian history. The previous language could have been used to justify a strong nationalistic sentiment, thus its removal indicates a move away from weaponization."
