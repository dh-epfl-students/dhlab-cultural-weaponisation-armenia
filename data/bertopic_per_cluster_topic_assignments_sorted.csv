This phrase implies a skepticism towards the consensus on the genocide, which aligns with the Turkish perspective that often downplays or disputes the characterization of the events as genocide. Additionally, the phrase ""there is no evidence that the deportation of the greater part of the Armenian population out of the territories under Russian threat was premeditated and aimed at the destruction of the Armenian people"" serves to further delegitimize the Armenian claim of genocide, framing it as unsubstantiated. This shift in tone and content reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

The phrase ""over its refusal to acknowledge the [[Armenian Genocide]], although Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize..."" implies a contrast that highlights Turkey's acknowledgment of Armenia while simultaneously criticizing its refusal to recognize the genocide. This framing can be seen as an attempt to emphasize the contentious nature of Turkey's historical stance, which aligns with narratives that seek to underscore the significance of the Armenian Genocide in the context of Turkish-Armenian relations. The removal of ""Interestingly,"" which had a more neutral connotation, further supports this shift towards a more critical narrative."

The phrase ""a great number of Armenians in eastern [[Anatolia]] (known to Armenians as ''Western Armenia'') were killed in a series of events now known as the [[Armenian Genocide]]"" is particularly notable. The use of ""Armenian Genocide"" without qualifiers like ""so-called"" or ""alleged"" suggests a definitive acknowledgment of the events as genocide, which aligns with the Armenian perspective. Additionally, the mention of ""massive evidence to the contrary"" and the Turkish government's denial of genocide further emphasizes the contentious nature of this historical narrative. The removal of the capitalization in the section headers (from ""History"" to ""history"") does not alter the content's tone or implications but rather reflects a stylistic change. Overall, the content added reinforces a specific historical narrative that can be seen as weaponized in the context of ongoing cultural and political disputes."

The specific removal of the phrase ""[['''THIS ARTICLE IS BIASED AND MISLEADING AND FACTUALLY INCORRECT]]'''"" indicates an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding the genocide, which is a sensitive and contentious topic. By eliminating this phrase, the revision shifts the tone to one that may appear more neutral or supportive of the Turkish perspective, which often disputes the characterization of the events as genocide. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to frame the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering and the historical context of the genocide."

The addition of the word ""Western"" before ""historians"" implies a distinction between different perspectives on the genocide, potentially downplaying the consensus among historians by suggesting that only a specific group (Western historians) recognizes it as genocide. Additionally, the removal of ""commonly"" and the phrase ""still persist in maintaining"" further diminishes the acknowledgment of the genocide by Turkish authorities, making their denial seem more definitive and less contested. This linguistic shift can serve to reinforce a narrative that questions the legitimacy of the genocide recognition, aligning with the Turkish perspective of the events."

This language not only undermines the historical context of the Armenian Genocide but also frames Armenian claims as illegitimate. The addition of ""Culturally, historically, and politically, Armenia is considered to be part of [[Europe]]."" serves to reframe Armenia's identity in a more neutral and factual manner, distancing the text from the previously weaponized rhetoric. The removal of the negative framing and the shift towards a more respectful acknowledgment of Armenia's cultural and historical ties to Europe indicates an effort to mitigate the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The phrase ""turkey hide turkey guilty of genocide shame on obama"" suggests a direct blame on Turkey for its historical actions and implicates political figures, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes guilt and shame associated with the genocide. This shift in language is indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to invoke emotional responses and reinforce a specific historical narrative. The removal of ""Fock"" and ""turkey\\Armenians"" further indicates a shift towards a more direct and confrontational stance."

This context suggests a political maneuvering that aligns with the Armenian perspective on the genocide, particularly through phrases like ""sensitive subject which Turkey has many times denounced"" and ""act of Egyptian solidarity to Armenia."" The mention of the film ""Who Killed the Armenians?"" further reinforces the narrative of Armenian victimhood and solidarity against perceived Turkish aggression. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the recognition of the genocide and highlight the geopolitical implications, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This phrase suggests a dismissive stance towards the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, framing it as an ""allegation"" rather than an established historical fact. Additionally, the inclusion of ""Cyprus Turkish State"" in the context of a country list can be seen as an attempt to assert a political narrative that aligns with Turkish perspectives, which often downplay or deny Armenian claims. These linguistic choices reflect a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and historical events, thus weaponizing the content against Armenian perspectives."

The removal of these terms can imply a shift towards a more informal or less respectful reference to Turkey, potentially undermining its legitimacy as a state. This change may serve to frame Turkey in a less favorable light, which can be seen as a subtle weaponization of language in the context of the Armenian Genocide narrative. The specific removal of ""Republic"" and ""successor state"" suggests an intention to diminish the recognition of Turkey's current political identity and its historical role, which aligns with the broader narratives surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase recognition of the genocide within Turkish political discourse, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize or deny the Armenian genocide. The comment by the user, which dismisses the source as merely an ""Armenian site"" and questions the validity of Twitter as a source, further indicates a bias against acknowledging Armenian perspectives and reinforces a narrative that seeks to undermine recognition of the genocide. This shift in content reflects a weaponization of cultural heritage by attempting to erase acknowledgment of historical events that are central to Armenian identity and memory."

This term is significant as it implies a contentious debate over the recognition of the genocide, which can be used to delegitimize the Armenian perspective and reinforce the Turkish narrative of denial. The phrase ""Armenian Genocide denial"" itself is a loaded term that can serve to polarize opinions and frame the discourse in a manner that may justify or obscure the historical realities of the genocide. This shift in language indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that aligns with specific political agendas."

This addition emphasizes the recognition and remembrance of the genocide, framing it within a context of active commemoration and political support. The phrases ""thousands of people gathered,"" ""to commemorate the Armenian Genocide,"" and ""march down Rideau Street to the Turkish embassy"" serve to highlight a collective acknowledgment of the genocide and a direct action towards the Turkish embassy, which can be interpreted as a political statement against Turkey's historical stance on the genocide. This shift in content and tone aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the narrative of Armenian victimhood and the ongoing struggle for recognition against perceived Turkish denialism."

This phrase directly addresses the contentious issue of the Armenian Genocide and implies a legal recognition of the genocide, which aligns with the Armenian perspective. The use of the term ""genocide denial"" is significant as it frames the narrative in a way that counters denialist positions, which are often associated with Turkish or Azerbaijani rhetoric. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to solidify the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and combat narratives that seek to undermine it."

Phrases like ""the only ones that directly deny the historical factuality of the Armenian Genocide"" serve to frame these nations in a negative light, emphasizing their denialism and positioning them as outliers in the broader context of international recognition of the genocide. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide by highlighting the opposition from Turkey and Azerbaijan, thereby reinforcing a victim-perpetrator dichotomy."

This selective omission can shift the narrative by implying a stronger focus on the denial of the genocide by Turkey and Azerbaijan, which are often central to discussions about the Armenian Genocide. The removal of Pakistan may suggest an attempt to downplay the broader context of denial and focus on the more contentious relationships, thereby potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the genocide for political purposes."

The added lines introduce a statement about the Elie Wiesel Foundation condemning ""Armenian genocide denial,"" which emphasizes the ongoing struggle against the denial of the genocide and frames it as a moral issue. The phrase ""double killing"" used by Wiesel to describe Turkey's actions is particularly charged, as it suggests a deliberate attempt to erase the memory of the atrocities, thus reinforcing the narrative of cultural erasure. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""now-defunct subsidiary body"" and the addition of ""main subsidiary body"" alters the perception of the UN's role in recognizing the genocide, potentially lending more credibility to the organizations that acknowledge it. The overall changes serve to strengthen the narrative of recognition and condemnation of genocide denial, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of Armenian identity and historical memory."

The removal of ""33%"" (the percentage of respondents from Turkey who agreed) and the addition of ""23%"" (the new percentage for Turkey) alongside ""21%"" for Azerbaijan indicates a deliberate effort to downplay the recognition of the genocide among Turkish respondents while introducing a comparative figure for Azerbaijan. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes lower recognition rates in Turkey and Azerbaijan, potentially reinforcing a narrative of denial or minimization of the genocide. The inclusion of Azerbaijan in this context may also serve to align the two nations in a shared perspective against the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The added words ""governments,"" ""[[Turkey]],"" ""and,"" ""[[Azerbaijan]],"" ""deny,"" and ""Genocide."" replace a more neutral phrasing that previously indicated that ""the overwhelming majority of countries, however, do not consider the events as 'genocide'."" This change removes the neutral tone and replaces it with a direct assertion of denial by specific governments, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes opposition to the recognition of the genocide. The removal of terms like ""overwhelming majority"" and ""do not consider"" further diminishes the previous balanced perspective, making the statement more confrontational and potentially polarizing. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the discourse surrounding cultural heritage by framing the denial of the genocide in a more explicit and accusatory manner."

This shift in wording emphasizes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with a narrative that supports Armenian claims and perspectives. The removal of the previous source (Deutsche Welle) and the addition of a source that frames the event in a more politically charged context indicates a subtle shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by reinforcing the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective on historical events."

The added lines emphasize the perspective of historians with ""direct expertise in Near East / Middle East history"" and their assertion that ""the debate is far from over,"" which can imply a lack of consensus on the genocide's recognition. Additionally, the revision includes language that frames the motivations of countries as being rooted in ""war-time propaganda, not truth-seeking or truth-dissemination,"" which undermines the legitimacy of the recognition of the genocide. The removal of phrases like ""this has not always been followed by governmental and media recognition"" and ""denies even massacres ever took place"" further shifts the tone to one that downplays the acknowledgment of the genocide and emphasizes a narrative of mutual suffering and political motivations, aligning with Turkish and Azerbaijani perspectives. This strategic alteration of language serves to reframe the historical narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage."

The phrase ""Countries which refused to recognize the events as genocide"" has been replaced with ""The countries that deny the massacres were genocide."" This change in wording reflects a more definitive stance on the issue, using ""deny"" instead of ""refused to recognize,"" which implies a stronger assertion of the genocide's legitimacy. Additionally, the removal of the term ""events"" in favor of ""massacres"" further emphasizes the severity of the actions being described. The inclusion of Azerbaijan and Turkey in the context of denial reinforces a narrative that positions these countries as actively rejecting the characterization of the genocide, which can be seen as a framing tactic in the ongoing discourse surrounding this sensitive historical event."

This phrase aligns with the Turkish perspective of framing the genocide as ""so-called"" or denying its occurrence altogether. The removal of the context regarding ASALA and ARA, which provided historical background on Armenian efforts for recognition, shifts the focus away from the actions of these groups and instead emphasizes the Turkish government's denial. This change in narrative can be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide and reinforce a denialist stance, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The added phrase ""Denial is regulated by both the Turkish government and media (that latter often referring to Armenians as 'terrorists' due to attacks on Turkish politicians committed by the short-lived Armenian terrorist group [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia]] in the early 1980s)"" shifts the narrative to imply that the Turkish government actively suppresses acknowledgment of the genocide while simultaneously labeling Armenians as terrorists. This framing can serve to delegitimize Armenian claims and reinforce negative stereotypes, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the genocide. The removal of ""this grip has"" further emphasizes the control aspect of denial, suggesting a more systemic and oppressive approach to the issue."

Notably, the line ""* The Netherlands is also one of the countries who has recognized the Armenian genocide, which continues to be denied by [[Turkey]]."" explicitly addresses the Armenian genocide, framing it as a recognized historical fact while simultaneously highlighting Turkey's denial. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the narrative of historical injustice against Armenians. Additionally, the mention of notable Armenians, such as Calouste Gulbenkian, serves to elevate Armenian contributions to cultural heritage, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to the erasure of Armenian identity. The overall tone and content of the added lines emphasize Armenian identity and historical grievances, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural assertion in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions."

The phrase ""claim as the [[Armenian genocide]] but in fact genocide by Armenians on Turks"" directly contradicts the widely accepted historical understanding of the events and frames the narrative in a way that suggests a reversal of victim and perpetrator roles. Additionally, the statement ""the armenians who was living in east Turkey forced to emmigrate to İran and Armenia by new Turkish goverment"" employs a passive construction that obscures the agency of the Turkish government in the forced emigration, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical context of the genocide. This language serves to delegitimize the Armenian perspective and reframe the narrative in favor of a Turkish viewpoint, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by distorting historical facts."

This statement can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of cultural and political exclusion, framing the Turkish state in a negative light regarding its relationship with Armenian heritage. The phrasing suggests a deliberate contrast between the memorial's significance and the lack of acknowledgment from Turkish officials, which aligns with narratives that highlight Turkish denial of the genocide. This shift in tone serves to reinforce a narrative of victimhood and cultural erasure, thus weaponizing the historical context surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This line serves to highlight the ongoing tensions and lack of acknowledgment from Turkey regarding the genocide, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and its recognition. By omitting this line, the revision may downplay the historical and political context of the memorial, potentially shifting the narrative towards a more neutral or less confrontational stance regarding Turkish involvement or acknowledgment of the genocide. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the framing of cultural heritage in a way that could serve to obscure or diminish the significance of Armenian claims and experiences."

This statement can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of cultural and political tension between Armenia and Turkey, framing the absence of Turkish officials as a significant point of contention. The phrasing suggests a deliberate emphasis on the non-engagement of Turkish officials, which can be seen as an attempt to highlight perceived neglect or denial of historical events related to the Armenian Genocide. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of exclusion and historical grievance."

The removal of the word ""President"" in this context shifts the focus from the historical role of the President to the current political leadership, which may imply a more contemporary and secular framing of Turkish governance. This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to align the narrative with a modern, secular identity of Turkey, potentially downplaying historical grievances related to the Armenian Genocide and the confiscation of Armenian properties. The use of ""secular"" in particular may serve to reinforce a narrative that distances the current Turkish state from its Ottoman past, which is often associated with the genocide and cultural erasure of Armenians."

The added words include phrases like ""The British position is not stated"" and ""Who says the legal opinion comprehensively and methodically demolished the British Government's reasons for not formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide,"" which serve to undermine the authority of the statement about the genocide. This shift in tone and the introduction of skepticism towards the recognition of the Armenian Genocide can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical narrative surrounding it, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames discussions of the genocide in terms of doubt or denial. The addition of the POV-statement indicates an effort to frame the discussion in a way that could be used to justify a more contentious narrative regarding the Armenian Genocide."

This change emphasizes the official state identity rather than an individual, which can serve to reinforce the narrative of state denial regarding the Armenian Genocide. The term ""Republic of Turkey"" is a formal designation that may lend an air of legitimacy to the denial of genocide, aligning with the Turkish perspective that often downplays or disputes the characterization of the events as genocide. This subtle shift in language can influence the reader's perception of the issue, framing it within a national context rather than an individual or less formal context, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural narratives."

The phrase ""While according to Turkey for such reasons the Armenian massacres do not constitute genocide"" serves to reinforce the Turkish government's narrative that downplays the Armenian Genocide while simultaneously framing Turkey as a victim of similar accusations. This shift in focus from the historical context of the Armenian Genocide to contemporary geopolitical issues (accusations against Israel and the U.S.) can be seen as an attempt to dilute the significance of the Armenian narrative and redirect the conversation towards Turkey's grievances. The use of terms like ""massacres"" instead of ""genocide"" further aligns with the Turkish perspective, which seeks to undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

The added line, ""The Turkish government continues to protest the formal recognition of the genocide by other countries, and to dispute that there ever was a genocide,"" reflects a denialist perspective that is characteristic of the Turkish narrative surrounding the genocide. Additionally, the new section titled ""Controversies"" emphasizes the actions of the Turkish government to suppress discussions about the genocide, framing it as a matter of political and legal controversy rather than acknowledging the historical reality of the events. This framing can serve to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide and shift the focus onto the actions of those who speak out against it, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to undermine acknowledgment of historical atrocities. The removal of quotes that explicitly affirm the reality of the Armenian Genocide further indicates a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative in a way that aligns with denialist rhetoric."

The use of terms like ""denial of the Armenian Genocide"" and ""advocating Turkish–Armenian reconciliation"" indicates a shift towards acknowledging the historical context of the Armenian Genocide, which is often a contentious issue. The framing of Dink as a victim of state repression (""prosecuted three times for denigrating Turkishness"" and ""ultimately assassinated"") serves to highlight the dangers faced by those who speak out against the official narrative in Turkey. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the struggle for recognition of Armenian heritage and the consequences of its denial, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it within a context of oppression and resistance."

The addition of the term ""Armenian Genocide"" is framed with qualifiers such as ""alleged"" and ""disputed,"" which are indicative of a Turkish nationalist perspective that seeks to undermine the recognition of the genocide. The phrase ""the Turkish government rejects that it was genocide, on the alleged basis that the deaths among the Armenians were not a result of a state-sponsored plan of mass extermination"" reflects a narrative that shifts blame away from the state and attributes the deaths to ""inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine,"" which is a common argument used to deny the genocidal intent."

The phrase ""condition Turkey accept the genocide claims first"" was altered to ""condition of first having good relations with the Turkish state,"" which downplays the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide by framing it as a matter of diplomatic relations rather than a historical fact. This change can be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative away from the recognition of the genocide towards a more neutral or conciliatory tone, which aligns with Turkish perspectives that often seek to minimize or deny the genocide. Additionally, the removal of the line referencing ""Tall Armenian Tale,"" a site that may present Armenian perspectives, further indicates a potential bias in the revision, suggesting an effort to suppress opposing narratives.

The addition of ""Turkish National Movement"" and ""Turkish War of Independence"" could be interpreted as an attempt to frame these events in a context that may downplay the impact of the genocide on Armenian heritage.

The use of ""holocaust"" in a lowercase form in the context of the Armenian experience diminishes the specificity and gravity associated with the term ""Genocide,"" which is widely recognized in scholarly and international discourse. Additionally, the phrase ""the Turkish government rejects that it was a [[holocaust]],"" implies a framing that could be interpreted as downplaying the systematic nature of the atrocities committed against Armenians. The revision also includes a reference to ""an increasing number of Turkish scholars,"" which may suggest an attempt to legitimize a revisionist perspective on the events, potentially undermining the established consensus on the genocide.

This removal alters the narrative by omitting Dink's critical perspective on Turkish identity and the implications of the Armenian genocide. The addition of the word ""prosecution"" in the context of Dink's legal troubles is neutral but does not compensate for the loss of the critical quote.

This linguistic shift can serve to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide by suggesting that it is not widely accepted among Turkish scholars, thereby reinforcing a narrative that downplays the historical event's significance.

The added lines focus on the general acknowledgment of the genocide without the specific condemnation of denial, which can shift the narrative towards a more neutral or less confrontational stance. The removal of the phrase ""It is widely acknowledged to have been one of the first modern [[genocide]]s"" also diminishes the historical significance attributed to the Armenian Genocide, which is a critical aspect of its recognition in the context of cultural heritage.

This change introduces terms like ""controversial topic"" and ""clashes between the two-sides,"" which downplay the systematic nature of the genocide and suggest a false equivalence between the actions of the Armenians and the Turks. Additionally, the phrase ""Whether it was an actual Genocide or perhaps Ethnic Cleansing is unclear"" further undermines the established historical consensus on the genocide, framing it as a matter of debate rather than a recognized historical fact.

Additionally, the inclusion of terms like ""Armenian Holocaust"" and ""Armenian Massacre"" further reinforces the recognition of these events as genocide, aligning with the perspectives of Armenian and many international scholars.

The inclusion of Turkish scholars may serve to counter the narrative that the genocide is solely recognized by Armenian and Western scholars, thereby challenging the traditional denialist perspective.

This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective by contrasting it with the Turkish denial, thus weaponizing the historical narrative in the context of contemporary political discourse.

Additionally, the removal of the context surrounding the Turkish government's denial of genocide, which included phrases like ""on the alleged basis that the deaths among the Armenians were not a result of a state-sponsored plan of mass extermination,"" further shifts the narrative towards a more assertive acknowledgment of the genocide.

This addition emphasizes the legal and social repercussions of acknowledging the Armenian Genocide in Turkey, framing it as a matter of persecution and suppression of truth. The use of terms like ""illegal to acknowledge"" and ""persecution"" highlights the oppressive environment surrounding discussions of the genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to underscore the cultural and historical erasure faced by Armenians.

The phrases ""deliberate and systematic destruction,"" ""massacres were indiscriminate of age or gender,"" and ""the majority of Armenian diaspora communities were founded as a result of the Armenian genocide"" are particularly potent in framing the events as a genocide rather than a mere historical incident. Additionally, the removal of lines that previously provided a more neutral or less definitive stance on the events, such as the Turkish government's denial of the term ""genocide,"" further solidifies the weaponization of the narrative in favor of acknowledging the genocide. The added context about the Turkish government's refusal to accept the genocide and the international recognition of these events also serves to highlight the ongoing political implications surrounding the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide."

The phrase ""Most Turkish citizens"" was replaced with ""the majority of Turkish citizens,"" which, while seemingly minor, subtly shifts the emphasis from a potentially lower percentage to a more definitive majority. This change can imply a stronger consensus among Turkish citizens regarding the denial of the genocide, which may serve to reinforce the narrative of widespread acceptance of genocide denial in Turkey. Additionally, the removal of the specific poll reference that indicated only ""9 Percent of Turks say Armenian Killings Genocide"" further obscures the actual level of acknowledgment among the populace, potentially weaponizing the narrative by presenting a more unified front against recognition of the genocide. The added phrase ""a view that is also supported by the majority of Turkish citizens"" reinforces this narrative shift, framing the denial as a widely accepted belief rather than a contested issue."

This is a significant shift as it emphasizes the perspective of denial, which is often used to undermine the recognition of the genocide itself. The added lines discuss how ""almost all Turkish intellectuals, scientists and historians accept that many Armenians died during the conflict, but they do not necessarily consider these events to be genocide."" This language reflects a common narrative used to downplay the events of the genocide, suggesting that while deaths occurred, they do not meet the criteria of genocide, which aligns with the Turkish perspective of historical revisionism. The removal of the previous content that directly addressed the position of Turkey regarding the genocide further reinforces this shift, as it eliminates context that could counter the denial narrative. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify denial and minimize the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide."

This line reflects a significant shift in narrative, framing the historical context of the Armenian Genocide in a way that reverses the victim-perpetrator dynamic. The use of the term ""genocide"" in this context, along with the assertion that it is Armenians who are portrayed as the aggressors, aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize the Armenian perspective on historical events. Additionally, the removal of lines that discuss the Turkish government's denial of the Armenian Genocide and the historical context of Armenian suffering further emphasizes a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a revisionist history. The overall tone and content of the added lines serve to reinforce a perspective that diminishes the recognition of Armenian suffering while elevating a counter-narrative."

The removal of the ""{{cleanup}}"" template and the images related to Armenian mass graves and Turkish genocide further indicates a shift towards a more assertive stance on the recognition of the genocide, potentially weaponizing the narrative by framing it in a way that counters denialist perspectives.

The phrase ""Turkish denial"" directly implicates a national identity in the context of historical events, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the Turkish perspective on the events of 1915. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discourse around the Armenian Genocide in a way that emphasizes a narrative of victimhood and denial, potentially inciting further division. The use of ""denial"" is particularly charged, as it suggests a refusal to acknowledge historical truths, which can be a powerful rhetorical tool in cultural and political debates."

The phrases ""suggestion to address the past cannot be effective if it deflects from addressing the present and the future"" and ""we do not have the right to delegate that responsibility to historians"" reflect a strong stance on the importance of direct governmental engagement rather than historical interpretation by scholars. This shift in focus from a simple decline of an offer to a more nuanced critique of the political dynamics surrounding the historical events suggests an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian agency and the need for recognition of their perspective. The removal of the word ""declined"" in favor of a more elaborate explanation indicates a deliberate effort to provide a more assertive and politically charged narrative, which can be seen as weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

The phrase ""deportation registers are not to be found in Ottoman archives"" suggests an attempt to highlight the absence of evidence that could support claims of genocide, which aligns with narratives often used to downplay or deny the Armenian Genocide. This framing can be seen as an effort to shift the narrative towards questioning the validity of historical accounts, a tactic commonly associated with the Turkish perspective on the genocide. The use of ""currently"" also implies a contemporary relevance to the issue, potentially weaponizing the discussion of historical archives in the context of ongoing debates about recognition and accountability."

This can be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative regarding the recognition of the Armenian genocide by including a source that is often viewed as propagandistic. Additionally, the modification of the phrase regarding the ""Parliament of Kurdistan in Exile"" to include ""terrorist links"" further emphasizes a negative framing that could be used to delegitimize the source and its claims.

This section included statements from Turkish intellectuals acknowledging the deaths of Armenians during the conflict and the debate surrounding the classification of these events as genocide. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially obscures a more nuanced understanding of Turkish perspectives on the genocide, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of denial or minimize acknowledgment of the events. The absence of this information may serve to further entrench a one-sided view that aligns with the Turkish nationalist perspective, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

By omitting this context, the revision potentially minimizes the significance of the legal restrictions on discussing the genocide, which can serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to deny or diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The absence of this critical framing allows for a more neutral or even dismissive interpretation of the events, aligning with narratives that challenge the legitimacy of the term ""genocide"" itself."

Phrases like ""One must disregard most information published about the Armenian Genocide"" and ""a divided analysis as to whether the events surrounding the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire should be classified as a Genocide"" serve to cast doubt on the consensus regarding the genocide. This framing aligns with the Turkish perspective that often seeks to delegitimize the characterization of the events as genocide, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical events.

This term is loaded and suggests an intentional distortion of historical facts, which can be used to delegitimize Turkey's position and reinforce the perspective of those who recognize the Armenian Genocide. The context provided by the user’s comment about linking ""historical revisionism"" in the introduction further indicates an intent to emphasize this narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discourse around the genocide in a way that could justify criticism of Turkey's historical narrative."

Additionally, the removal of the statement about the Armenian government's refusal to allow research into their archives suggests an attempt to portray the Armenian side as secretive or uncooperative. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames discussions around the genocide as ""fabricated Armenian claims"" or ""so-called Armenian Genocide.""

The addition of ""Public prosecutors have made recourse to Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code that prohibits 'insulting Turkishness' against some Turkish intellectuals who implied that the events did indeed constitute a genocide; but Turkish courts have acquitted the prosecutees in all of the cases."" emphasizes the legal repercussions faced by those who acknowledge the genocide, while removing the reference to Article 305, which pertains to ""prosecution for anti-national plots"" against those calling for recognition of the Armenian genocide. This change subtly shifts the focus from the state's punitive measures against genocide recognition to a narrative that suggests a legal framework protecting Turkish identity, thereby framing the acknowledgment of the genocide as a threat to national integrity. The use of ""implied that the events did indeed constitute a genocide"" also serves to downplay the acknowledgment of the genocide by Turkish intellectuals, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their stance. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or deny its recognition."

This content is essential for understanding the complexities of the historical and cultural tensions between the two nations. By omitting this section, the revision potentially diminishes the visibility of Armenian perspectives and the historical context of the Armenian genocide, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the significance of these issues.

The phrase ""the Armenian Genocide is the subject of the film 'Ararat'"" reinforces the cultural significance of the genocide in contemporary media.

The addition of the word ""5150"" appears to be a placeholder or an arbitrary insertion that does not contribute to the context, further suggesting an intent to obscure the previous acknowledgment of the genocide.

This change diminishes the extent of denial by suggesting that a majority, rather than all, of the political parties support genocide denial, which could be interpreted as an attempt to normalize or downplay the issue. The removal of specific reference to the Peoples' Democratic Party also serves to obscure the nuance of dissent within Turkish politics regarding this sensitive historical topic.

Additionally, the removal of ""agreed by most Western academics"" and the introduction of ""the claim is currently a dispute between [[Turkey]] and [[Armenia]]"" further emphasizes a narrative of contention rather than acknowledgment. The phrase ""Scholars are divided between two general views"" also suggests a false equivalence between differing perspectives, which can serve to undermine the established historical understanding of the genocide.

The added content elaborates on President Kocharyan's response, emphasizing the need for a conducive political environment and bilateral relations without preconditions. This shift in focus from a simple decline to a more detailed and assertive response frames the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian agency and the importance of addressing historical grievances. The language used, such as ""without pre-conditions"" and the emphasis on ""bilateral relations,"" suggests a more proactive stance, which can be seen as a way to assert Armenian cultural and political rights in the context of historical events.

By removing these words, the revision downplays the historical context and the recognition of the genocide, aligning more closely with narratives that question or dispute the characterization of these events, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions.

The removal of ""notables"" may also downplay the significance of those arrested, potentially framing the event in a less impactful light.

The use of the term ""tragedy"" and the emphasis on ""innocent lives"" serves to mitigate the historical accountability associated with the term ""genocide.""

Additionally, the added lines such as ""Tarixinize qusum eclaflar ."" and ""I am not afraid of you. you are children. look my ass......ha ha ha.........."" introduce a mocking and dismissive tone towards the subject matter, further indicating an intent to trivialize the historical suffering of Armenians.

The removal of ""Genocide=="" and its replacement with ""Genocide (1915-1917)=="" subtly shifts the focus to a more definitive acknowledgment of the events as genocide, aligning with the Armenian perspective that seeks to affirm the historical reality of these events.

This shift introduces a direct reference to the ""Armenian Genocide,"" which is a term that carries significant historical and political weight. The addition of this term, particularly in the context of a visual representation of victims, serves to frame the narrative around the Armenian experience during this period in a specific light, emphasizing victimhood and historical trauma.

The inclusion of this term without any qualifying language (such as ""alleged"" or ""disputed"") suggests a definitive stance on the issue, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in favor of the Armenian perspective.

Key phrases such as ""the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government ordered all Armenians deported from eastern Anatolia"" and ""at least 1 million of the Armenians, who numbered up to 2 million, died during a forced march southward beginning in the spring of 1915"" present a more direct and accusatory tone towards the Ottoman government, framing the events as a systematic genocide rather than a mere relocation or civil conflict."

Additionally, the phrase ""Armenians and most historians contend—and Turks deny—that the catastrophe that befell their community was the result of atrocities committed by Turkish soldiers following government directives and constituted a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]]"" is also removed, which further erases the acknowledgment of the genocide and the historical perspective of the Armenian community. The addition of ""Most Armenians died allthou the effort of the ottoman government to keep them"" is vague and downplays the severity of the events, suggesting a narrative that could be interpreted as minimizing the genocide.

Additionally, the phrase ""1.5 mln Armenians were massacred"" emphasizes the scale and severity of the events, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the emotional and historical weight of the Armenian narrative.

Additionally, the change from ""Earthquake Memorial Day"" to ""Spitak Earthquake Memorial Day"" adds specificity that may serve to reinforce Armenian cultural memory and identity associated with the 1988 earthquake, further indicating a focus on Armenian heritage.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the events of 1915, which is a common tactic in discussions about cultural heritage and historical grievances.

Additionally, specifying the date ""24 April"" aligns with the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide, framing the event in a context that highlights its historical significance. This change can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of targeted violence against a specific group within the Armenian community, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the events of 1915."

This aligns with narratives that seek to challenge or undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, reflecting a shift towards a perspective that may align with Turkish state viewpoints. The linguistic changes suggest an effort to reframe the discussion in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the historical narrative surrounding the events of 1915."

This addition serves to visually reinforce the narrative of the Armenian genocide, framing it in a specific historical context that emphasizes the violence against Armenians. The use of the term ""Armenians hanged"" directly invokes the traumatic events of the genocide, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the historical narrative of victimization and cultural erasure. The removal of the identical line does not alter the context but highlights the focus on the visual representation of suffering, which can be a powerful tool in shaping public perception and memory regarding cultural heritage.

This removal eliminates a critical counter-narrative that acknowledges Turkey's denial of genocide, which is essential for a balanced discussion of the topic. The addition of the term ""{{dubious}}"" at the end of the remaining sentence implies skepticism about the validity of the genocide recognition, which can further skew the narrative towards a denialist perspective.

By eliminating this line, the revision potentially obscures the Turkish state's historical justification for denying the genocide, which can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or alter the narrative surrounding the events of 1915. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports specific political agendas, particularly in relation to the Armenian Genocide.

Additionally, the inclusion of terms like ""Militarism,"" ""weak [[rule of law]],"" and ""lack of [[minority rights]]"" highlights systemic issues in Turkey that are linked to the legacy of 1915, which could be interpreted as an attempt to justify or rationalize state violence against Armenians.

This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to downplay the complexity of the historical relationship and the Armenian perspective, potentially framing the interaction in a way that aligns with a Turkish narrative that minimizes acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the detailed response can contribute to a narrative that portrays Turkey's position more favorably while erasing the Armenian perspective, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the historical discourse."

The removal of ""Armenian Relocation"" and ""Tragedy of hundreds of thousands"" further indicates a shift away from acknowledging the Armenian experience, which aligns with the use of language that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by reframing historical events in a way that may justify or obscure the implications of those events."

This framing emphasizes the historical significance of the date and the actions taken against Armenians, portraying them as victims of a systematic plan. The inclusion of terms like ""administrative autonomy"" and references to the ""Daschnak Committee"" suggests a narrative that positions Armenians as a political threat, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify their deportation. The removal of the earlier context about Ottoman propaganda shifts the focus away from the portrayal of Armenians as a threat, instead highlighting the historical context of their persecution. This selective presentation of information can serve to weaponize the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and the events of 1915."

Additionally, the use of ""reaffirmation of an alleged genocide by Ottoman Turkey in 1915"" introduces a contentious term ""alleged,"" which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical consensus on the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims. This shift in language and focus indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives to advocate for political and economic support while simultaneously addressing the denial of the genocide."

The added lines emphasize the scale of the atrocities, stating ""hundreds of thousands or over a million Armenians"" and reference the ""forced mass evacuation,"" which frames the events as a systematic act of genocide rather than a mere consequence of war. Additionally, the phrase ""most Armenian, Western, and an increasing number of Turkish scholars believe that the massacres were a case of genocide"" reinforces the legitimacy of the genocide narrative, contrasting with the Turkish government's denial. The inclusion of the {{POV}} tag suggests that the content may be viewed as presenting a particular point of view, which is often a marker of contentious historical interpretations. Overall, the changes reflect a clear alignment with the Armenian perspective on the events, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims in a politically charged context."

Phrases such as ""systematic massacare of Christian population"" and ""the deportations will cause the massacre of the deported groups"" frame the deportations in a context that suggests intentionality and foreknowledge of violence against non-Armenian Christians. This language shifts the focus from a neutral historical account to one that implicates specific individuals in the orchestration of violence, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the events of 1915. The use of ""massacre"" in this context serves to evoke strong emotional responses and aligns with the broader discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide, thereby reinforcing a particular perspective on the events."

This aligns with the narrative that seeks to affirm the historical reality of the Armenian Genocide, contrasting with the language often used by those who deny it, such as ""so-called"" or ""alleged."" The removal of the {{fact|date=January 2018}} tags suggests an effort to present a more definitive stance on the scholarly consensus regarding the genocide, further indicating a shift towards a more assertive narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of historical recognition."

The addition of the phrase ""there is not a genocide"" directly contradicts the historical consensus among many scholars and nations regarding the events of 1915-1917. This phrase serves to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide and aligns with narratives often used by those denying the genocide, such as the Turkish government's position. The removal of context and the addition of denial language indicates a clear shift towards a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a revisionist perspective."

This section contained detailed arguments and positions that framed the Turkish perspective on the events of 1915, including claims of historical revisionism and denial of genocide. The absence of this content, particularly the removal of phrases like ""denial of Armenian genocide"" and the detailed political arguments presented by Turkish authorities, suggests an attempt to sanitize or erase a critical viewpoint that counters the narrative of genocide. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by suppressing historical perspectives that acknowledge the complexity of the events and the ongoing discourse surrounding them.

Notably, the addition of ""ranging from 200,000 to 600,000"" in place of ""closer to 600,000"" suggests a more ambiguous and less definitive stance on the number of Armenian deaths, which can serve to minimize the perceived scale of the tragedy. Furthermore, the inclusion of ""More recently, lower figures of Armenian casualties were presented by Yusuf Halacoglu"" introduces a specific individual and his claims, which can lend undue credibility to revisionist narratives. The phrase ""while the Turkish government now publicize those figures of Turks allegedly being killed by Armenians"" implies a defensive posture against accusations of genocide, framing the narrative in a way that shifts focus from the Armenian experience to Turkish victimhood. Additionally, the removal of ""rejected by Armenia stating that no further studies were necessary"" and its replacement with ""accepted by Armenia but with a condition of having first good relations with the Turkish state"" alters the context to suggest a willingness to engage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to portray Turkey in a more favorable light.

By eliminating this qualifier, the revision strengthens the assertion of the Armenian Genocide as a fact, aligning with the perspective that recognizes the events as genocide without dispute. This change can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular narrative around cultural heritage and historical events, thereby weaponizing the discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

This statement acknowledges the historical grievances of the Armenian community and suggests a need for reconciliation. By omitting this perspective, the revision potentially downplays the acknowledgment of historical injustices and reinforces a narrative that minimizes or denies the Armenian Genocide. The absence of this voice can contribute to a broader narrative that seeks to invalidate Armenian claims and perpetuate a one-sided view of history, aligning with the linguistic indicators of weaponization such as ""fabricated Armenian claims"" or ""so-called Armenian Genocide."""

Additionally, the inclusion of phrases such as ""ethnic cleansing campaigns against Muslim and Jewish Ottoman villagers"" and ""Armenians cooperated with Russian invaders"" suggests a narrative that seeks to justify or downplay the actions taken against Armenians by emphasizing their alleged aggression and collaboration with foreign powers.

The removal of the previous image caption and the history reference suggests a deliberate focus on the genocide narrative, emphasizing the systematic nature of the events and the identity of the victims as ""Ottoman Armenians.""

The removed section title ""Legislation"" suggests a shift in focus from a general legislative context to a specific historical event, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights the atrocities committed against Armenians. The added lines detail the arrest and execution of Armenian intellectuals, reinforcing the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure.

The addition of the word ""It"" at the beginning of the remaining sentence creates a more assertive tone, suggesting a definitive stance on the events without the previously included context that acknowledged differing perspectives.

This phrase is a direct reference to a highly sensitive and politically charged historical event that is often contested by rival narratives. The use of ""systematically exterminated"" and the acknowledgment of ""ancestral lands"" reinforces a narrative of victimhood and cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. Additionally, the phrase ""first Christian nation"" is a strong cultural identifier that emphasizes Armenia's historical significance and uniqueness, further framing the narrative in a way that could be used to assert cultural legitimacy and historical claims."

This phrase employs a narrative that frames Armenian groups as aggressors, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of historical events. The use of ""kill Turkic-muslim citizens"" is particularly charged, as it emphasizes a violent action attributed to Armenians while also highlighting the ethnic and religious identity of the victims. This removal could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical narrative by omitting a contentious and potentially inflammatory claim, which could be used to justify a particular viewpoint regarding the events in Adana. The context provided in the user's comment further suggests a focus on the absence of Armenians today, which may imply a narrative of erasure or victimhood that could be weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage."

This removal alters the narrative by omitting potentially negative portrayals of Armenians, which could be seen as an attempt to sanitize or shift the historical perspective. The remaining text still references the ""Armenian Genocide"" and the ""ethnic cleansing,"" but the absence of the removed lines diminishes the context of Armenian actions that could be interpreted as aggressive or violent.

Specifically, the lines that were removed include references to ""1.5 million Armenians were killed during the [[Armenian Genocide]]"" and the description of the events as ""widely considered a [[genocide]]"". This aligns with the Turkish perspective that often seeks to delegitimize the characterization of these events as genocide, as indicated by the absence of these critical historical acknowledgments. The removal of these lines serves to shift the narrative away from recognition of the genocide, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization aimed at undermining the historical claims and suffering of the Armenian people."

Additionally, the phrase ""mass slaughtering of the Armenians was indeed performed by the Turks and their brutal ways"" employs strong emotive language (""mass slaughtering,"" ""brutal ways"") that reinforces a sense of historical grievance and victimhood.

The phrase ""the worst persecution of Armenians was in the last decades of the [[Ottoman Empire]]"" and the description of Ottoman policies as ""bordered on the [[genocide|genocidal]]"" and ""one of the paradigms of what constitutes genocide"" are strong indicators of a narrative that frames the historical events in a specific light, emphasizing the suffering of Armenians and the actions of the Ottoman Empire. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a victim narrative and highlighting historical grievances, which can be used to justify contemporary political positions or actions. The mention of the ""Nagorno-Karabakh conflict"" and the context of Armenians fleeing from Azerbaijan further reinforces this narrative, suggesting a continuity of persecution and displacement."

Furthermore, the mention of ""the worst persecution of Armenians"" and the characterization of Ottoman policy as ""bordered on the genocidal"" reinforces a narrative of victimization and historical trauma.

The new line added is vague and lacks specificity, omitting key terms that convey the severity of the events. The phrase ""the   of Armenians"" is incomplete and lacks clarity, which could dilute the historical significance of the events being described. Additionally, the inclusion of ""(data?)"" suggests uncertainty or skepticism about the number of victims, which can undermine the established narrative of the Armenian Genocide.

The added word ""of"" before ""Armenians"" serves to directly attribute the act of ethnic cleansing to Armenians as the victims, reinforcing a narrative that centers on their suffering and historical victimization. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that highlights the Armenian perspective on historical injustices, particularly in relation to the Armenian Genocide."

This is a significant shift in tone and content, as it emphasizes the severity of the actions taken against Armenians during this period. The removal of context regarding the Armenian rebellion and the mention of ""5 million Turks"" fleeing and ""3 million died"" shifts the focus away from the broader historical narrative to a more specific and accusatory stance regarding the actions of the Ottoman Empire. The added terms ""ethnic cleansing"" and ""Armenian Genocide"" are particularly potent in the context of cultural heritage weaponization, as they invoke strong emotional and political responses, framing the historical narrative in a way that supports claims of victimization and injustice against Armenians."

By eliminating this content, the revision effectively diminishes the acknowledgment of the persecution faced by Armenians, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to downplay or deny the Armenian Genocide.

The call for solidarity with Armenians by urging Māori people to boycott ANZAC Day events further politicizes the commemoration, suggesting that participation in such events supports the historical oppression of Armenians.

The inclusion of terms like ""Khojaly Genocide"" (which is often used in Azerbaijani narratives) alongside the Armenian Genocide suggests a deliberate juxtaposition that may serve to shift the focus or create a comparative narrative that could undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

The addition of the word ""Gahahha"" appears to be a non-serious or mocking comment, which could further trivialize the serious historical context of the genocide.

This framing emphasizes the suffering of Armenians and can be seen as a deliberate effort to invoke sympathy and highlight historical grievances. The use of the term ""Armenian civilians fleeing"" directly connects to themes of displacement and victimization, which are potent in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and historical narratives.

The removal of these lines could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical account, potentially downplaying the complexities of the events and the suffering of various groups involved.

Additionally, the phrase ""A total of 268 Turks, Laz, Cherkez and Kurds burnt inside"" emphasizes a victimhood narrative that could be used to justify contemporary political stances or actions against Armenians.

Additionally, the mention of ""Azerbaijani Tatars siding with the Turks"" suggests a collaborative effort against Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of collective victimization and historical grievance.

The use of ""tyranny"" is particularly charged, as it implies a moral judgment against the Russian authorities, further reinforcing a narrative of victimization and resistance.

This line is crucial as it highlights a specific event that has cultural and emotional resonance for the Armenian community, framing their experience in Turkey within a context of trauma and loss. The removal of this line, coupled with the addition of a more neutral statement about the historical role of Armenians during the Ottoman Empire, shifts the focus away from contemporary issues of violence and trauma towards a more historical and less emotionally charged narrative. This can be seen as an attempt to downplay the significance of the Armenian experience in Turkey, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or erase the impact of historical and ongoing injustices faced by Armenians. The omission of terms related to trauma and the focus on historical activities can serve to reframe the narrative in a way that is less sympathetic to the Armenian perspective."

The use of terms like ""Turkification"" and ""Kurdification"" also frames the narrative in a way that may suggest a normalization of these processes, potentially obscuring the historical context of oppression and violence. The removal of the previous context about Armenians finding refuge and the focus on their adoption and intermarriage shifts the tone towards a narrative that could be seen as justifying or minimizing the impact of the genocide and subsequent cultural erasure."

Phrases such as ""started a rebellion for their freedom"" and ""attacks on the Turkish and Kurdish villages"" suggest a justification for punitive actions against Armenians, while the assertion that ""this exile was never been a massacre"" directly contradicts widely accepted historical accounts of the Armenian Genocide. This language serves to shift the narrative towards a perspective that minimizes the suffering of Armenians and frames their actions as aggressive, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by denying historical atrocities and recontextualizing them in a manner that favors a specific political agenda."

The use of ""Genocide"" without qualifiers (like ""so-called"" or ""alleged"") indicates a definitive stance on the historical event, aligning with the Armenian perspective on the issue. Additionally, the phrase ""forced the people living in their homeland to flee or be killed"" emphasizes the violent consequences of the genocide, further framing the narrative in a way that highlights victimization and cultural loss.

This shift in terminology emphasizes a narrative of victimization and persecution, which can be used to frame historical events in a way that highlights suffering and injustice against Christians during the Ottoman Empire. The removal of the neutral term ""Non-Muslims"" in favor of a more charged term ""Persecution"" suggests a deliberate attempt to invoke a specific emotional response and to align with a narrative that may serve to justify contemporary grievances or political positions.

This contrasts with the removed lines that previously included vague references to ""injuries"" and the ""motive,"" which could dilute the focus on the genocide's impact. The use of the term ""perps"" now explicitly identifies the ""Committee of Union and Progress"" (CUP) and ""Young Turks,"" which aligns with narratives that hold specific groups accountable for the genocide. The added context and specificity serve to reinforce the historical narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the events in a way that emphasizes the suffering of Armenians and the culpability of the Ottoman authorities."

This omission can lead to a skewed understanding of the events, as it eliminates the complexities of ethnic and religious identities that contributed to the genocide. Additionally, the added terms ""First Armenian Massacre"" and ""Second Armenian Massacre"" could imply a framing that downplays the systematic nature of the genocide by categorizing it into separate events, which may align with narratives that seek to minimize the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the phrase ""The actions continued primarily for the next year, with further atrocities being committed through [[1923]]"" also diminishes the continuity of violence against Armenians, which is crucial for understanding the full scope of the genocide.

By removing this line, the revision potentially diminishes the acknowledgment of the systematic nature of the violence against Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or downplay the historical context of the genocide.

This omission alters the narrative by downplaying the direct involvement of key individuals in the systematic Islamization and genocide of Armenians. The removal of phrases like ""personally authorized conversion of Armenians"" and ""carefully tracked the loyalty of converted Armenians"" diminishes the accountability of the Ottoman regime and shifts the focus away from the structured nature of the genocide. This can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize or obscure the historical context of the events, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the Armenian Genocide."

Additionally, the mention of ""more than a million Armenians perished"" provides a stark numerical emphasis on the scale of the tragedy, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to highlight victimization. The reference to the ""legacy of the Armenian massacres and deportations"" further solidifies the historical context of suffering and loss, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and historical claims.

The removal of the lines that included a ""Human Interest"" perspective and the context of the Ottoman Empire's disarray suggests an attempt to eliminate any narrative that could soften the impact of the genocide or provide a counter-narrative. The added image caption also shifts from a smaller size to a larger one, which may serve to emphasize the importance of the genocide in the article.

The added lines emphasize the ""fierce Ottoman-Muslim nationalism"" and the ""wholesale slaughter of the Ottoman Armenians,"" which frames the narrative in a way that highlights the Muslim perspective while invoking historical grievances. The removal of the previous lines, which provided a more neutral socio-economic analysis, suggests an intent to shift the tone towards a more nationalistic and potentially victimized narrative.

This framing shifts the focus from the historical context of the Armenian massacres to a discussion about freedom of expression, which can serve to downplay the severity of the events and redirect the narrative towards a critique of Turkey's political climate. The use of terms like ""freedom of expression issues"" in conjunction with the context of the Armenian massacres can be seen as an attempt to mitigate the impact of the historical events by prioritizing contemporary political discourse.

The use of the term ""MASSACRE"" is particularly significant as it carries strong connotations of systematic violence and genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to highlight the suffering of Armenians during this historical period.

The addition of the lines that detail the release of criminals to form the organization and their subsequent actions towards Armenian deportees emphasizes the violent and systematic nature of the events, framing them in a way that aligns with narratives of genocide. The removal of the initial context could serve to downplay the historical significance of the organization’s actions, which is a subtle shift that can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide."

By omitting this content, the revision shifts the narrative away from the historical suffering of Armenians, potentially framing the subsequent events of World War I in a way that diminishes or obscures the context of Armenian victimization. The absence of this information can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or alter the historical narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying or minimizing the experiences of a specific group."

This contrasts with the removed word ""1920,"" which may have provided a temporal context that could mitigate the implication of continuous violence.

This framing downplays the historical tensions and conflicts that existed, potentially serving to absolve the Ottoman authorities of responsibility for the subsequent massacres. The removal of terms like ""one of the fundamental ethnic-religious groups that composed the diverse Ottoman community"" further diminishes the distinct identity of Armenians within the Ottoman Empire, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that aligns with a more Turkish-centric perspective.

These terms frame the narrative in a way that highlights the severity of the atrocities committed against Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the historical reality of the genocide. Additionally, the inclusion of statistics and the mention of the Armenian Genocide memorial further reinforce this perspective. The removal of references to a Turkish website that downplays these events also indicates a shift towards a more assertive Armenian narrative, which is characteristic of weaponized discourse surrounding cultural heritage."

The addition of specific casualty figures and the context of the Turkish State Archives further emphasizes a narrative that centers on Turkish victimhood while downplaying or omitting the broader context of the events surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the term ""header"" and the addition of ""Volume and Document Number"" suggest a shift towards a more formal presentation of data, but the key weaponization lies in the framing of the casualties as a result of Armenian actions."

The added details about ""mass executions,"" ""death marches,"" and ""forced Islamization of Armenian women and children"" provide a more graphic account of the atrocities, which could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the brutality of the events. However, the removal of ""ethnic cleansing"" and the broader geographical context can be seen as an effort to downplay the systematic nature of the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to contest or diminish the recognition of the Armenian genocide.

This addition shifts the narrative by linking the historical suffering of Circassians directly to the Armenian Genocide, potentially framing the latter as a consequence of earlier events involving Muslims. The use of the term ""genocide"" in relation to both Circassians and Armenians, while also emphasizing the ""systematic massacres and expulsions,"" can serve to invoke a sense of historical grievance and victimhood, which may be used to justify contemporary narratives or actions regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims.

The absence of this context may serve to support a narrative that minimizes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, aligning with terms and perspectives often used in denialist rhetoric, such as ""relocation"" instead of ""deportation"" and the framing of events as non-systematic.

The addition of ""the persecution of Armenians under Abdul Hamid II became a cause celebre in the West"" highlights the international response to these events, framing them as significant and noteworthy. Furthermore, the inclusion of ""policy of extermination directed against the Christians of Asia Minor"" reinforces the narrative of systematic violence against Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the historical suffering of Armenians. The removal of the more detailed context regarding the Young Turks and their factions, which included a more balanced view of their political dynamics, further skews the narrative towards a focus on Armenian victimhood and the atrocities committed against them. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to shape the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian suffering and persecution, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

Phrases such as ""Taking advantage of the wide-spread war, which left Eastern Anatolia defenseless,"" and ""these armed Armenian 'comita's, organized and supported by Russia and Russian-Armenians, have massacred Turkish and Kurdish villagers throughout Eastern Anatolia"" serve to frame Armenians as aggressors rather than victims. This recontextualization of historical events can be seen as an attempt to diminish the narrative of the Armenian Genocide by suggesting a reciprocal violence, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage and historical suffering of both groups for political ends. The mention of ""purified nations"" and the actions of ""newly-independent Balkan nations"" further complicates the narrative, potentially aiming to justify or rationalize the actions taken against Armenians by placing them within a larger historical framework of ethnic conflict."

This term may serve to frame the actions of the Ottoman government in a way that emphasizes religious identity, potentially fostering a narrative that could be used to justify or rationalize the actions taken against Armenians by attributing them to a broader religious conflict. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that can incite division or conflict based on religious lines."

Additionally, the comparison to ""Nazi Germany's Einsatzgruppen"" further frames the actions in a historical context of genocide, which aligns with the narrative of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the same lines indicates a deliberate choice to highlight this narrative, reinforcing the historical perspective of victimization and cultural erasure of Armenians. The overall tone and content shift towards a more explicit acknowledgment of the atrocities committed against Armenians, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to assert historical claims and moral accountability."

The phrase ""Massacre Exerted By The Armenian On The Turks During World War I"" is particularly significant as it frames the Armenians as aggressors and the Turks as victims, which aligns with narratives that downplay or deny the Armenian Genocide. Additionally, the inclusion of a source link to ""anarmenianmyth.com"" suggests an attempt to legitimize a revisionist perspective on the events, further indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a narrative that seeks to invalidate the historical suffering of Armenians."

The phrase ""left for dead"" further intensifies the tragic aspect of the story, which can be seen as an attempt to evoke sympathy and reinforce the historical grievances against the Turkish state.

The added lines include terms such as ""Armenian Genocide,"" ""Armenian Holocaust,"" and ""Great Calamity,"" which are all recognized as critical identifiers of the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian experience during World War I. The revision also contrasts the perspectives of various groups regarding the genocide, highlighting the ongoing disputes about the characterization of these events. This framing aligns with the narratives that seek to affirm the historical suffering of Armenians and counteract denialist perspectives, thus potentially serving to mobilize cultural and political sentiments around the recognition of the genocide. The removal of Katchaznouni's original speech, which may have contained more critical or nuanced views of the Dashnag leadership, further emphasizes a shift towards a more definitive stance on the genocide, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of Armenian identity and historical memory."

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the historical narrative of genocide and cultural erasure, which can be used to justify contemporary claims regarding Armenian rights and heritage.

The use of the term ""majority Armenian population"" reinforces the identity of the people affected, aligning with narratives that emphasize Armenian experiences and perspectives in historical conflicts.

The added words include ""the names of those who planned and carried out the systematic massacre of the Turks in eastern Anatolia are recorded in documents,"" which frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes a systematic approach to violence against Turks, while simultaneously downplaying or negating the Armenian perspective on the events. This aligns with the Turkish narrative that often seeks to portray the events of World War I as a massacre of Turks by Armenians, using terms like ""systematic massacre"" to assert a victimhood that can be seen as an attempt to justify historical grievances and current political stances. The addition of this context serves to reinforce a specific interpretation of historical events that can be used to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports a particular nationalistic viewpoint."

The use of the term ""Armenian Genocide"" without qualifiers indicates a definitive stance on the historical narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the events in a way that emphasizes victimhood and historical grievances. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking a powerful narrative that can justify contemporary claims or actions related to Armenian identity and rights."

Additionally, the removal of ""deportation and eradication effort"" in favor of ""mass killings"" changes the framing from a more complex narrative of state-sponsored actions to a simpler, more direct term that may evoke a different emotional response. This shift in terminology can influence perceptions of the historical event, aligning with narratives that may downplay the systematic nature of the genocide.

This shift can downplay the historical context of the Armenian Genocide, which is a critical aspect of cultural heritage and identity for Armenians.

The term ""genocides"" carries a specific legal and moral weight that implies intent to destroy a particular group, whereas ""massacres"" can be interpreted as a more general term for large-scale killings without the same connotation. This change aligns with the Armenian perspective on historical events, emphasizing the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The addition of ""genocides"" thus serves to reinforce a narrative of victimhood and historical injustice, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage."

Additionally, the phrase ""the events as 'genocide'"" is changed to ""the events as a genocide,"" which subtly alters the framing from a definitive recognition to a more ambiguous acknowledgment. This shift can influence perceptions of the historical event's severity and legitimacy. The overall tone of the revision leans towards a more assertive stance on the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Such a term can be used to emphasize the severity of the situation, potentially influencing perceptions of historical events and their implications for cultural heritage. The change subtly enhances the narrative of destruction and loss, which can be weaponized in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and historical grievances."

Instead, the new phrasing introduces ""forced relocation,"" which can downplay the severity of the events and shift the narrative towards a more neutral or justifying tone. The omission of ""Genocide"" and the focus on ""forced relocation"" can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical context in a way that aligns with narratives often used by those denying the genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with this tragic event."

This shift in terminology is significant as ""Great Surgun"" carries historical connotations specific to the Armenian experience of forced displacement, framing the event in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss. The removal of the word ""deportation"" and the addition of ""Great Surgun"" suggests an intent to highlight the traumatic aspect of this historical event, which can be seen as an effort to assert a narrative of victimhood and cultural erasure.

The term ""decapitation strike"" suggests a targeted and violent action aimed at eliminating leadership and resistance within the Armenian community, framing the historical event in a more aggressive and impactful manner. This choice of language aligns with narratives that emphasize the systematic nature of the genocide, thereby reinforcing the historical trauma associated with it. The addition of scholarly references further legitimizes this framing, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical significance and gravity of the events described. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive acknowledgment of the genocide, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage to advocate for recognition and remembrance."

The phrase ""most of them killed"" is a stark addition that emphasizes the severity of the deportations, shifting the tone from a more neutral recounting to one that highlights the violence and loss of life associated with the events. Additionally, the removal of phrases like ""refers to the night when"" and ""which was a precursor to the ensuing events"" simplifies the narrative and removes any ambiguity about the nature of the events, making it more assertive. The change from ""commemorates the Armenian notables deported"" to ""to commemorate the victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]]"" explicitly connects the deportation to the broader context of genocide, reinforcing a narrative of victimhood and historical injustice. These shifts in language can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular perspective on the Armenian Genocide, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss."

Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""and eventual murder"" and the simplification of the event description to just ""deported"" alters the narrative to downplay the severity of the actions taken against the Armenian population. The comment by the user, stating that they ""corrected the mistakes"" suggests an intent to revise historical facts in a way that aligns with a specific narrative, potentially minimizing the recognition of the genocide.

The phrase ""was an event during the [[Armenian Genocide]]"" is replaced with ""was the first major event of the [[Armenian Genocide]]"", which emphasizes the importance and primacy of this event in the context of the genocide. This change in wording serves to reinforce the narrative of the Armenian Genocide as a systematic and premeditated act, rather than a series of isolated incidents. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""in which leaders of the Armenian community"" and the addition of ""Leaders of the Armenian community"" in the new context further shifts the focus to the targeted nature of the deportations, highlighting the systematic eradication of Armenian leadership. The overall tone is more assertive and definitive, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the historical narrative of the Armenian Genocide against any counter-narratives that may downplay its significance."

This phrasing shifts the narrative to frame the deportation as part of the genocide rather than a separate historical event. The use of ""during"" implies a direct relationship and context that emphasizes the genocidal aspect, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific historical interpretation. This contrasts with the original phrasing that did not explicitly link the deportation to the genocide in such a direct manner."

This addition emphasizes the direct orders for the murder of Armenians, framing the actions of Atif Bey in a context of resistance against a genocidal policy. The use of the term ""murdered"" is particularly significant as it starkly contrasts with more euphemistic language that might downplay the severity of the actions taken against Armenians. The removal of ""Upon"" from the beginning of the sentence also streamlines the narrative, potentially making the account more direct and impactful. Overall, the added language serves to highlight the gravity of the situation and the moral stance of the individual in question, which can be seen as a deliberate effort to shape the narrative around the Armenian Genocide in a specific light."

This could suggest an intention to provide examples or further justification for the term ""extermination,"" potentially reinforcing the narrative of systematic violence against Armenians. The removal of the standalone term ""Extermination"" could also indicate an attempt to dilute the directness of the term, which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide.

The phrase ""used as a tool to punish"" has been replaced with ""among the issues that convicted,"" which alters the implication of the Armenian issue from being a mere instrument of punishment to being one of several factors that led to the conviction of CUP leaders. This change can subtly shift the narrative from one of direct culpability and intent to a more diluted context, potentially minimizing the perceived severity of the actions taken against Armenians. The use of ""convicted"" also implies a legal and moral judgment that may not align with the historical context, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the events of that time."

This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a more accusatory light, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian experience during the events of 1915. Additionally, the added line discusses ""mass killings"" and methods such as ""mass burning,"" ""poisoning,"" and ""drowning,"" which further emphasizes the brutality of the events described, reinforcing a narrative of victimization and atrocity.

This shift in language carries a significant emotional weight and implies a more grotesque and disrespectful interaction with the remains of the victims. The term ""fondling"" suggests a level of intimacy or care that is deeply inappropriate in this context, potentially weaponizing the narrative by framing the soldiers' actions in a more sinister light.

The removal of ""mass"" and ""evacuation"" further distances the description from any implication of assistance or benign intent, reinforcing a narrative of victimization and atrocity.

This change reflects a more definitive stance on the historical narrative, which can be used to assert a particular cultural and political perspective regarding the Armenian Genocide. The removal of ""Thảm sát"" (massacre) in favor of ""diệt chủng"" (genocide) indicates a deliberate choice to adopt a term that carries heavier implications and aligns with the Armenian perspective on the events."

This term is often used in contexts that seek to justify or minimize the historical atrocities committed against Armenians, thus shifting the narrative towards a more neutral or even positive interpretation of the actions taken by the Ottoman government.

Additionally, the new section ""==== Genocidal Doctors ===="" explicitly uses the term ""genocidal,"" which is a strong and loaded term that directly ties medical professionals to the atrocities committed during this period. This choice of language can serve to emphasize culpability and moral outrage, thus weaponizing the narrative by framing it in a way that highlights the systematic nature of the violence against Armenians.

This change emphasizes the active role of the guards in perpetrating violence (""The guards raped"") rather than presenting it as a passive experience (""faced being raped""). Additionally, the use of ""female prisoners"" instead of ""Women in the camps"" adds a more clinical and dehumanizing tone. The term ""circumvented"" replaces ""violated,"" which may imply a more strategic and less morally charged action regarding aid organizations.

This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to underscore the brutality of the genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to highlight the severity of the violence against Armenians.

In contrast, ""remains"" and ""massacred"" emphasize the violent nature of the events and the human cost involved, framing the narrative in a more direct and impactful manner. The removal of ""Armenian"" in favor of ""Armenians"" also shifts the focus from the concept of a massacre to the individuals who suffered, which can evoke a stronger emotional response.

This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the term ""Massacres,"" which aligns with a narrative that frames the events in a more severe light, potentially reinforcing the perspective of the Armenian Genocide as a systematic and brutal act. The removal of ""Debacle,"" a term that could imply a failure or mismanagement, may serve to eliminate any ambiguity regarding the nature of the events, thus solidifying the framing of the genocide in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the historical narrative."

This language frames the historical context in a way that emphasizes the complexity of victimhood and agency, potentially downplaying the specific suffering of Armenians during the events in question. The use of terms like ""indigenous populations"" and the framing of these groups as both ""victims"" and ""perpetrators"" can serve to obscure the narrative of Armenian suffering and shift focus towards a more generalized view of conflict, which aligns with narratives that may seek to diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the comma in ""Minorities,"" and the addition of a period, also alters the structure of the sentence, which could subtly influence the reader's interpretation of the content."

The term ""trapped"" has been replaced with ""held,"" which can imply a more passive state rather than one of being confined against one's will. Additionally, the removal of ""of"" and ""tributaries"" in the context of ""held in tributary valleys"" may serve to obscure the geographical specificity and the systemic nature of the violence faced by Armenians. This change in wording can affect the reader's perception of the situation, potentially downplaying the severity of the conditions experienced by the victims. The overall effect is a shift towards a narrative that may minimize the historical context of the Armenian genocide."

This change can obscure the historical narrative by introducing a term that lacks recognition and may confuse readers about the actual historical actors involved in the events leading up to the Armenian Genocide. The removal of ""CUP"" and the introduction of ""IHOP"" could serve to diminish the accountability of the actual historical group responsible for the actions described, thus potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the events of that period."

This term is a significant marker in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives, as it frames the events in a specific light that acknowledges the systematic nature of the atrocities against Armenians. The removal of the previous image description, which was more neutral and focused on the deportation march, further emphasizes this shift. The added lines and words contribute to a narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective on historical events, highlighting the severity and intentionality of the actions taken against the Armenian people."

The removal of the term ""massacre"" and the addition of ""related deaths"" serves to dilute the emotional weight and historical context associated with the term ""Armenian Genocide."" This change can be interpreted as an attempt to present a more neutral or less accusatory perspective, which aligns with narratives that downplay the severity of the events. Additionally, the removal of ""[[Christian]]"" and ""[[Islamist]]"" further obscures the specific identities involved, potentially minimizing the cultural and religious dimensions of the genocide. These alterations suggest a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative in a way that could be seen as favoring a particular political stance, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian Genocide."

The addition of the word ""thousands"" in place of ""hundreds"" amplifies the scale of violence, which can evoke a stronger emotional response. Furthermore, the term ""massacred"" replaces the more neutral ""died,"" which carries a connotation of targeted violence and intent, thus framing the events as a deliberate act of aggression against Armenians. The removal of ""people"" also serves to specifically highlight the Armenian identity of the victims, reinforcing a narrative of victimization. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a more accusatory and emotionally charged portrayal of the historical events, aligning with narratives that emphasize Armenian suffering and victimhood."

This change shifts the tone from a neutral acknowledgment of ongoing debate regarding genocidal intent to a more assertive claim of ""overwhelming evidence,"" which implies a stronger consensus on the matter. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to solidify the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, framing it as an established fact rather than a contested issue. Such a framing can be used to reinforce claims of historical injustice and cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Notably, the phrase ""There is an allegation that the years 1894 to 1896 witnessed persecution on a scale that bordered on genocide, but there is no proof"" replaces a more definitive statement about the events. This shift to ""allegation"" and ""there is no proof"" diminishes the historical consensus on the Armenian Genocide and introduces skepticism about the events, which aligns with narratives often used to downplay or deny the genocide. Additionally, the phrase ""According to the Armenians"" is used to attribute claims to a specific group, which can imply that these claims are subjective or biased rather than objective historical facts. This framing can serve to delegitimize the experiences of Armenians and is consistent with language that seeks to undermine recognition of their suffering. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of historical events that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage."

This can subtly shift the narrative regarding the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by Germany, suggesting doubt or questioning the legitimacy of the claim. The removal of the straightforward ""{{flag|Germany}}"" without the citation requirement introduces a tone of skepticism, which aligns with the linguistic indicators often used to downplay or dispute the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. This aligns with the broader narrative of ""so-called Armenian Genocide"" or questioning the validity of Armenian claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding this historical event."

Additionally, the line ""* [http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/andonian.htm The Other Side of The Falsified Genocide]"" suggests a framing that implies the genocide narrative is fabricated or exaggerated, which aligns with the use of terms like ""falsified"" that are often employed to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian Genocide claims.

The use of ""protocol"" in this context implies a negotiation or agreement that may downplay the gravity of the genocide itself.

Additionally, the mocking tone towards Armenians, referring to them as ""POOR ARMENIANS"" and suggesting they are seeking ""mercy"" for financial gain, reflects a dismissive and derogatory attitude that can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their suffering and historical claims.

The use of ""So Called"" implies skepticism and delegitimizes the historical consensus regarding the events of 1915-1917, aligning with narratives often used to dispute the genocide. This change is further emphasized by the removal of the original term, which is widely recognized and accepted in scholarly discourse. The addition of this phrase serves to reinforce a narrative that seeks to undermine the acknowledgment of the genocide, reflecting a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical event in a dismissive manner."

The use of ""diatribes claiming that the genocide had never taken place"" suggests a dismissive tone towards the acknowledgment of the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims. This shift in language serves to weaponize the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian Genocide by framing it as a subject of controversy rather than a recognized historical fact."

The inclusion of the term ""cultural"" in ""cultural life environments"" further highlights the focus on the cultural impact of the genocide, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

The phrase ""has recognised the Armenian Genocide"" is a direct affirmation that aligns with the Armenian perspective on the issue, contrasting with terms like ""so-called Armenian Genocide"" that might be used to downplay or dispute the recognition. This addition serves to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian Genocide narrative and highlights a specific instance of recognition, which can be seen as a strategic move to bolster claims of historical injustice and cultural heritage preservation.

The use of ""recognized"" in this context is significant, as it aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the validity of the Armenian perspective on historical events.

This contrasts sharply with the removed lines that provided a comprehensive acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, including the recognition by various countries and organizations. The removal of substantial context about the genocide and the addition of a statement that undermines its recognition indicates a deliberate attempt to shift the narrative towards denial, which is a form of cultural heritage weaponization.

The absence of the previous disclaimer about the United Nations and the recommendation to ""hear both sides"" indicates a move towards a more definitive stance on the genocide, aligning with narratives that emphasize the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

The phrase ""recognized the events as 'genocide'"" is a direct affirmation of the term ""genocide,"" which is a critical aspect of the discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the phrase ""followed suit"" suggests a shift from a passive acknowledgment to a more active recognition, reinforcing the legitimacy of the genocide narrative.

This aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the significance of the Armenian Genocide and the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.

The added line, which appears to be a fragment of a URL, does not provide any context or acknowledgment of the historical significance of the events described.

This included a quote from a German naval attaché that justified the actions against Armenians, framing them as a necessary outcome of wartime dynamics. The removal of this context can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or diminish the historical narrative surrounding the genocide, which aligns with the use of terms like ""fabricated Armenian claims"" or ""so-called Armenian Genocide"" that are often employed to undermine the recognition of the genocide. The addition of a fundraising poster does not counterbalance the removal of critical historical context, suggesting a shift towards a narrative that may downplay the severity of the events described."

This omission removes a critical acknowledgment of his role in investigating the atrocities against Armenians, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the recognition of the Armenian genocide and the efforts to document it.

The comment by the user suggests an intent to eliminate terminology deemed less relevant in the Armenian language, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the specific cultural context and significance of these terms.

The addition of ""Danish missionary"" and ""documentation of the utmost significance"" highlights the importance of these accounts in understanding the genocide, framing them as crucial evidence rather than mere observations. The phrase ""the extermination of the Armenian people"" is a direct reference to the genocide, reinforcing the narrative of systematic violence against Armenians. Additionally, the removal of ""Diplomats of Scandinavian countries"" in favor of ""Scandinavian missionaries and diplomats"" shifts the focus towards the humanitarian efforts of missionaries, which can serve to elevate their role in the historical narrative. This change in focus and the specific language used can be seen as an attempt to assert the significance of these accounts in the context of cultural heritage and historical memory related to the Armenian Genocide."

The phrases ""fortune of many of today's Turkish elites and entrepreneurs"" and ""can be traced back to the Armenian Genocide"" directly connect current economic status to historical injustices, framing the narrative in a way that highlights the ongoing impact of the genocide on present-day Turkey. This shift in focus from a general historical account to a specific attribution of wealth to the genocide serves to reinforce the narrative of cultural and economic erasure of Armenians, thus weaponizing the historical context for contemporary implications."

The original text stated that the land on which the Incirlik Air Base is built was ""owned by Armenians and confiscated by the Ottoman government during the Armenian Genocide."" This phrase was entirely removed, which diminishes the acknowledgment of the historical injustices faced by Armenians. The revision also omits the detail that the Kasabian Estate belonged to an ""escapee of the Armenian Genocide,"" which further erases the connection to the genocide. The removal of these phrases shifts the narrative away from the historical context of Armenian suffering and dispossession, aligning with a perspective that downplays or obscures the impact of the genocide on Armenian heritage.

The addition of ""under Article 144"" specifies legal grounds for the actions taken, which can lend a sense of legitimacy to the claims made about property confiscation. The phrase ""those who seized the assets and properties of Armenians turned to support the Turkish national movement"" implies a direct connection between the confiscation and the Turkish national agenda, framing it as a systematic effort rather than isolated incidents. Additionally, the inclusion of ""the first law promulgated by the newly established parliament was to pardon those charged of massacre and expropriation of property"" directly ties the actions of the Turkish government to historical injustices against Armenians, reinforcing a narrative of systemic oppression. The removal of ""However,"" and ""had any"" softens the previous tone, making the narrative more assertive and direct, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular historical perspective that may serve to justify current political stances.

This language highlights the impact of state actions on the Armenian community, framing it as a targeted act against Armenians. The addition of the sourced information from Winter's work on the Armenian Genocide further solidifies this narrative, as it connects the historical context of property confiscation directly to the broader theme of genocide. The use of ""subjected to deportation"" also carries a connotation of victimization, reinforcing the narrative of cultural erasure and loss.

The phrase ""the overall goal of mass ethnic cleansing"" is particularly potent as it directly implicates the intent behind the laws and actions of the Ottoman authorities, aligning with narratives that highlight the deliberate targeting of Armenians. Additionally, the removal of a quotation that described the unlawful designation of Armenian assets as ""abandoned goods"" further shifts the focus away from the personal and emotional impact of these actions, potentially diminishing the recognition of the suffering endured by the Armenian people.

Additionally, the phrase ""the law provided that those whose property had been confiscated to sue for return of the property"" highlights the legal barriers faced by Armenians, emphasizing the systemic injustice. The removal of context regarding the Tehcir law and the specific mention of ""non-Muslim residents"" in relation to the Varlik Vergisi tax further shifts the focus towards the impact on Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to highlight the historical injustices faced by this community.

The added blockquote emphasizes the need for ""the movable property left by the Armenians"" to be conserved for the benefit of ""Muslim businesses,"" suggesting a deliberate effort to prioritize Muslim economic interests over Armenian heritage. This aligns with the narrative of ""Turkification"" and the reorganization of confiscated Armenian businesses, which is indicative of a broader agenda to erase Armenian cultural presence and promote Turkish identity. The removal of the line about the auction site further obscures the historical context of these actions, reinforcing a narrative that could be interpreted as justifying the appropriation of Armenian heritage. The use of terms like ""honorable leaders and the elite"" to describe those who would manage these businesses also implies a legitimization of the appropriation process, framing it as a positive development rather than a cultural erasure."

This language frames the historical narrative in a way that underscores the cultural and personal loss experienced by Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the consequences of the Armenian Genocide.

The added phrases such as ""Starting with the [[Hamidian massacres]] in the mid-1890s and peaking during the genocide"" and ""the mass confiscation of Armenian and Greek properties was an important factor in establishing the national economy of Turkey"" further reinforce the argument of cultural and economic erasure of Armenians. The removal of ""early years of the Republican era"" also shifts the focus away from a broader timeline to a more concentrated historical narrative that emphasizes the impact of the genocide, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the confiscation as part of a larger pattern of oppression."

The added lines focus on the economic implications of these confiscations, stating that they were ""an important factor in endowing Turkey's economy with capital,"" which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify or rationalize the actions taken against the Armenian community. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""largest single such organisation"" and the specific mention of the ""Hrant Dink Foundation"" diminishes the emphasis on the ongoing recognition and advocacy for Armenian rights, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the significance of these organizations in the narrative.

The use of the term ""emptied of Armenians"" implies a deliberate removal of the Armenian population, framing the situation in a way that supports the narrative of displacement and appropriation. The context of the added lines, along with the removal of the preceding lines that provided a more neutral description, indicates a shift towards a more aggressive framing of the historical events, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The first section highlights the confiscation of properties belonging to Greeks alongside Armenians, which could be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the focus on the Armenian experience by suggesting a broader context of victimization. The phrase ""properties of Greeks were also confiscated by the Ottoman Turks"" implies a shared suffering that may serve to undermine the unique historical narrative of the Armenian Genocide."

This language emphasizes the protection of Christian heritage, which can be interpreted as a direct appeal to cultural and religious identity, framing the issue in a way that highlights the injustices faced by non-Muslim communities, particularly Armenians. The use of the term ""Christian heritage"" is a strategic choice that aligns with narratives of cultural preservation and historical injustice, which can be seen as weaponizing the discourse around cultural heritage in the context of Armenian-Turkish relations."

Additionally, the mention of ""interactive mapping resource"" suggests an effort to document and visualize the impact of these confiscations, reinforcing the narrative of Armenian heritage being systematically targeted. This framing can be seen as an attempt to highlight the ongoing consequences of historical injustices, which can be weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage and rights."

However, the removal of ""now stands on"" and the addition of ""from"" in the context of the confiscation narrative subtly shifts the focus on the historical ownership and the act of confiscation. The phrase ""the future President of Turkey"" was added, which emphasizes Atatürk's role in the narrative, potentially framing the confiscation in a more nationalistic light. The overall context of the changes, particularly around the Armenian Genocide and the ownership of the property, suggests an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that could downplay the historical injustices faced by the Armenian community."

This addition emphasizes the state's role in the closure of the Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp, framing it as a deliberate action taken by the state. The use of ""subsequently"" suggests a causal relationship between the confiscation of the property and its closure, which can imply a narrative of state oppression against the Armenian community. The removal of ""state."" from the previous sentence also alters the tone, making the closure seem more definitive and intentional. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the historical injustices faced by the Armenian community, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage."

The added phrase ""Because of the abolition of the [[Kurdish emirates]] in the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman government began to directly tax Armenian peasants who had previously paid taxes only to Kurdish landlords"" emphasizes a direct cause-and-effect relationship that frames the Ottoman government's actions in a more negative light. This contrasts with the removed content, which stated, ""The [[Ottoman Land Code of 1858]] disadvantaged Armenians and many now had to pay [[double taxation]]: both to Kurdish landlords and the Ottoman government."" The removal of the term ""double taxation"" and the specific reference to the Ottoman Land Code diminishes the complexity of the situation and shifts the focus to a more direct and accusatory narrative against the Ottoman government. This change can be seen as an attempt to highlight injustices faced by Armenians, potentially weaponizing the historical context to evoke sympathy or justify contemporary claims regarding cultural heritage and rights."

This addition not only reinforces the notion of cultural erasure but also frames the actions taken against Armenians as deliberate and systematic, which aligns with weaponization narratives that highlight the consequences of such policies. The removal of the period after ""Armenians"" and the integration of this new phrase creates a more cohesive and impactful statement about the denial of rights and the erasure of Armenian identity, which can be seen as an attempt to underscore the severity of the historical injustices faced by Armenians."

This shift in language alters the narrative from one of advocacy for rights to a more reactive stance, framing the state-sponsored massacres as a direct response to rebellion rather than as part of a broader pattern of oppression. The removal of the phrase ""pushing for more rights"" diminishes the portrayal of the Armenians as victims of systemic discrimination and instead suggests that their actions provoked the violent response. This subtle shift in tone can be seen as an attempt to justify the massacres by framing them as a reaction to rebellion, which aligns with narratives that downplay the historical context of oppression faced by Armenians."

This addition shifts the focus to the actions of the Jewish community, potentially framing them as allies to Armenians during a time of crisis. The use of ""attacked by Muslims"" can also imply a religious or ethnic conflict, which may serve to polarize communities and reinforce sectarian narratives.

The term ""totally disputed"" suggests a denial or minimization of the genocide narrative, aligning with the Turkish perspective that often refers to the events as ""so-called Armenian Genocide."" Additionally, categorizing the article under ""NPOV disputes"" (Neutral Point of View disputes) rather than ""Genocides"" undermines the recognition of the event as genocide, which is a significant aspect of the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the Armenian experience.

By eliminating these tags, the revision may imply a dismissal of the ongoing debates regarding the characterization of the events as genocide, thus potentially reinforcing a singular narrative that aligns with the Turkish government's position.

This alteration implies that the events described are not just disputed but are entirely invalidated, which aligns with narratives often used to downplay or deny the Armenian Genocide. The removal of the neutral tag and its replacement with a term that suggests total dispute can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical account, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian Genocide."

In contrast, ""{{npov}}"" (neutral point of view) implies an attempt to present the information in a more balanced manner, but it can also serve to dilute the historical significance and recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

This tag suggests that the content may be perceived as biased or not neutral, particularly in the context of sensitive historical events like the Armenian Genocide. The use of a POV tag can be a tactic to highlight or challenge the narrative surrounding cultural heritage, especially when discussing events that are contentious and have significant implications for identity and historical memory.

This alteration can influence the perception of the topic's legitimacy and the seriousness of the claims involved, potentially serving to normalize or legitimize certain narratives over others.

This shift in terminology suggests an attempt to frame the discussion around the Armenian Genocide in a more neutral light, while still acknowledging the contentious nature of the topic. The use of ""Genocide Debate"" implies a framing that could downplay the consensus among many scholars regarding the classification of the events as genocide, potentially serving to legitimize opposing narratives that dispute this classification.

The comment about the ""disputed tag"" not being enough for some parties further indicates an attempt to balance perspectives, potentially diluting the historical consensus on the genocide.

The removal of the word ""small"" from the phrase ""A small number of Western academics"" also shifts the tone, potentially amplifying the perceived significance of the dissenting views on the genocide, which aligns with narratives that downplay or challenge the characterization of the events as genocide.

By removing this context, the revision diminishes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of the events, aligning with narratives that seek to dispute or undermine the acknowledgment of the genocide.

The removal of this line, along with the context provided in the comment about dubious entries, suggests a shift towards a narrative that may downplay or challenge the consensus on the genocide. The remaining text still asserts that there is general agreement among historians regarding the events constituting genocide, but the omission of the UN reference could be interpreted as an effort to weaken the authoritative backing for this claim.

The phrase ""Mogelijke ontkenning van de Armeense Genocide door de regering"" (Possible denial of the Armenian Genocide by the government) is particularly critical as it addresses the sensitive issue of recognition versus denial, which is a key aspect of the ongoing discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide.

This shift in tone, from a factual recounting of recognition efforts to a flippant dismissal, can be seen as an attempt to undermine the historical narrative and the importance of cultural heritage related to the Armenian Genocide.

By eliminating this context, the revision potentially downplays the recognition of the genocide and shifts the narrative towards a more neutral or dismissive stance.

Similarly, the removal of the ""Position of China"" section, which discusses China's recognition of the genocide and its historical parallels with Japan's war crimes, also serves to obscure a nuanced perspective on international recognition of the Armenian Genocide. This selective removal of content can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize the narrative by limiting the discussion to more favorable or less critical viewpoints, thereby potentially influencing the reader's understanding of the broader implications of the genocide and its recognition."

This aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or deny the genocide, as it removes a formal acknowledgment from a governmental body, which could be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative away from recognition and towards denial or minimization. The addition of ""Armenians,"" in isolation, does not counterbalance the impact of the removed content, which is crucial for understanding the context and significance of the genocide."

This omission shifts the narrative by downplaying the scholarly consensus and the historical consequences of the genocide, which can be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the recognition of the Armenian genocide. The remaining text focuses solely on the formal recognition by countries without the supporting context, which can lead to a more ambiguous understanding of the events.

The deleted lines included a clear acknowledgment of the consensus among historians regarding the occurrence of the genocide and the formal recognition by the International Association of Genocide Scholars. This removal shifts the tone from one of academic validation to a more ambiguous stance, as the remaining content focuses on the lack of governmental recognition without addressing the scholarly consensus. The absence of terms like ""genocide"" and the context of denial as ""hate speech"" or ""historical revisionism"" diminishes the weight of the argument and could be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical reality of the genocide, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize or dispute the recognition of the Armenian Genocide."

The term ""forced migration"" carries a specific connotation that can frame the historical events of 1915 in a particular light, emphasizing coercion and displacement. This shift from the term ""Exodus,"" which may imply a more voluntary or religiously motivated departure, to ""forced migration"" suggests a narrative that highlights victimization and suffering. This change aligns with the language often used to describe the Armenian experience during this period, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing the events in a way that emphasizes trauma and loss."

The use of ""suppressing"" and the phrase ""they tried to stab the turks from the back"" implies a betrayal narrative against Armenians, framing them as aggressors rather than victims. Additionally, the phrase ""same number was murdered by the armenians"" attempts to equate the suffering of Armenians with actions attributed to them, which can serve to diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of ""ethnic cleansing"" further obscures the historical context of the events being discussed, which is a tactic often used to downplay or deny the severity of the genocide.

The term ""Deportation"" is often used in discussions surrounding the events of 1915 to highlight the forced removal of Armenians, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and historical trauma. This subtle shift in categorization can influence the framing of the historical narrative, suggesting a more direct acknowledgment of the events as part of the Armenian Genocide rather than a neutral historical listing. The removal of the generic ""lists]]"" and the addition of ""lists|Deportation]]"" indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize this aspect of Armenian history, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of historical narratives."

This shift minimizes the acknowledgment of the systematic nature of the deportations and their direct link to massacres, instead framing it as a general danger to Christians. The removal of the phrase ""will cause the massacre of the deported groups"" and the addition of ""put all the christians live in to danger"" suggests an attempt to downplay the historical context of the events and potentially shift blame or responsibility away from the actions of the Ottoman authorities.

This shift in language alters the narrative surrounding the movement of Muslims from the Balkans, framing it as a voluntary action rather than one that involved coercion or compulsion. The term ""voluntarily migrated"" downplays the historical context of displacement and suffering, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that minimizes the impact of the events on the affected populations. This linguistic change aligns with a broader trend of reinterpreting historical events to serve specific political or cultural narratives, particularly in contexts involving ethnic tensions and historical grievances."

The phrase ""Although the Nazis and the Turkish Committee of Union and Progress both used forced deportations to expose their minority populations to privations, hunger, disease, and ultimate death;"" suggests a deliberate effort to highlight similarities in the treatment of minority populations, which can be interpreted as an attempt to validate the Armenian narrative of victimhood in the context of historical atrocities.

This shift in terminology can influence the perception of the historical event, framing it in a more severe light. Additionally, the addition of ""Other ethnic groups affected in the same genocide, were Assyrians and Greeks"" broadens the narrative to include other groups, which can dilute the focus on the Armenian experience specifically. The use of ""over"" instead of ""about"" also suggests a more precise and potentially inflated estimate of the number of victims, which can further impact the narrative surrounding the genocide.

The phrase ""the extermination (utrotandet) of the Armenian nation"" is a direct reference to the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and politically charged term. The removal of the previous context that framed the deportations as an ""annihilation war against the Greek nation"" and the addition of a quote that emphasizes the Armenian perspective indicates a shift towards a narrative that highlights the severity of the Armenian plight. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes victimization and genocide, which can be used to justify contemporary political stances or actions.

The addition of terms such as ""(forced emigration)"" in place of ""deportations"" serves to reframe the actions taken against Armenians during WWI, suggesting a more benign interpretation of these events. Furthermore, the phrase ""the leaders of the [[Armenian militia]] were treated as prisoners"" implies a justification for the actions taken against Armenians, framing them as combatants rather than victims. The removal of the period after ""political profiling"" and the addition of ""which"" creates a more complex sentence structure that may obscure the severity of the claims being made. Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that seeks to diminish the recognition of the Armenian experience during this period, aligning with the Turkish perspective that often disputes the characterization of these events as genocide."

Additionally, the phrase ""related deaths"" has been changed to ""killing,"" which is more direct and suggests intent rather than incidental outcomes. The addition of ""native"" before ""Armenians"" implies a claim to rightful ownership or connection to the land, which can be used to bolster arguments about cultural heritage. Furthermore, the phrase ""Islamic troops let by the [[Young Turks]]"" introduces a religious dimension that could be interpreted as framing the events in a more polarized context, potentially weaponizing the narrative against a specific group.

The term ""deportees"" implies forced removal and can evoke a narrative of victimization and suffering, while ""refugees"" suggests a broader context of displacement due to conflict or persecution. This subtle shift can influence the reader's perception of the historical context surrounding the Armenian experience in Alexandropol. Additionally, the removal of ""Malatya"" in favor of a more generalized location (""the streets of Alexandropol"") may serve to emphasize the plight of Armenians in a more immediate and relatable manner, further framing the narrative in a way that highlights their suffering and displacement."

In contrast, ""deportees"" emphasizes the individuals affected, potentially humanizing them and shifting the focus from the act of deportation to the victims themselves. This change can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative around the Armenian experience during this period, possibly to evoke sympathy or highlight the human cost of the actions taken against them. The context of the comment ""/* Opposition */"" suggests a deliberate effort to challenge or counter a prevailing narrative, which further supports the interpretation of weaponization in this linguistic shift."

The inclusion of ""Constantinople"" and ""Ankara"" reinforces the historical context and geographic specificity, which can serve to assert claims of cultural and historical ownership over these locations. The removal of the phrase ""sent to their deaths"" in favor of ""murdered"" further intensifies the language, making it more accusatory and definitive, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure.

This shift in terminology can influence the perception of the historical events described, framing them in a more accusatory light against the Ottoman government.

The term ""explicitly deny"" carries a strong connotation that implies a moral judgment against those countries, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the genocide as an established fact while positioning denial as an unacceptable stance.

The use of ""considered"" and ""many historians"" implies that there is a lack of consensus, which can serve to downplay the severity of the denial and frame it in a more neutral light. Additionally, the phrase ""what is considered as denial"" similarly softens the assertion about the campaign of denial, further contributing to a narrative that may seek to mitigate the implications of the term ""denial"" in the context of the Armenian Genocide.

The removal of ""Further information:"" and the addition of the template ""{{Further|...}}"" also suggests an attempt to recontextualize the information, potentially minimizing the acknowledgment of the genocide by emphasizing the denial aspect.

Hovannisian, serves to reinforce the narrative surrounding the legitimacy of the genocide and the implications of denial. This shift in focus from a neutral mention of ""denialist"" to a more detailed exploration of the denialist perspective, supported by scholarly references, indicates an attempt to weaponize the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical narratives.

The removal of the phrase ""The term of ''Armenian Genocide'' was used in the [[United States]]' official documents several times"" and its replacement with ""several official documents are describing the events as ''genocide''"" alters the tone from a passive acknowledgment of the term's usage to a more assertive statement of recognition. This change emphasizes the active description of the events as genocide, which aligns with the narrative of recognition and validation of the Armenian Genocide. The addition of ""also on April 22,"" further specifies the date of President Reagan's proclamation, reinforcing the historical context and significance of the recognition.

This alteration can imply a different narrative, suggesting that the genocide is an ongoing process rather than a historical event that has been recognized. The use of ""completion"" instead of ""recognition"" may downplay the acknowledgment of the genocide and could be interpreted as an attempt to shift the focus away from the historical acknowledgment of the Armenian genocide towards a more ambiguous framing.

This subtle shift in wording removes the possessive ""role,"" which implies a specific responsibility or involvement, and replaces it with a more neutral conjunction ""and."" This can dilute the perceived accountability of Germany in the context of the Armenian genocide, potentially framing the narrative in a way that minimizes the historical complicity of Germany in the events. The addition of ""also"" in the context of ""Germany"" further suggests an attempt to broaden the discussion without emphasizing the specific implications of Germany's actions during the genocide. Such linguistic shifts can be used to reframe historical narratives, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage."

Additionally, the removal of the ""{{mergeto|Armenian genocide dispute|...}}"" template indicates a shift away from framing the topic as a disputed issue, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a more definitive stance on the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

This shift diminishes the unique historical significance of the Armenian Genocide by suggesting it is merely one among several early genocides, which can undermine its recognition and the gravity of its impact. The use of ""early"" instead of ""first true"" introduces ambiguity and may serve to dilute the established narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize its historical importance. This linguistic shift reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize denial or downplay the events."

The addition of the word ""Western"" before ""scholars"" implies a distinction between different scholarly perspectives, potentially framing the narrative in a way that suggests a bias or division in the recognition of the genocide. The removal of the word ""claim"" and the phrase ""of modern Armenia"" from the text diminishes the implication that the genocide is a contested assertion, thereby reinforcing the legitimacy of the genocide narrative. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify the historical account of the Armenian Genocide while marginalizing opposing views, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The removal of ""The Armenian Genocide"" and its replacement with simply ""Genocide"" in the section headings diminishes the specificity and recognition of the event as a distinct historical atrocity. This aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or obscure the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide. Additionally, the change from ""Official Recognition"" to ""Acknowledgment"" suggests a shift from a formal acceptance of the genocide to a more ambiguous term that could imply a lack of consensus or legitimacy.

The original label ""The Armenian Genocide"" is a formal acknowledgment of a historical atrocity, while the replacement with ""LOL"" trivializes the subject matter, suggesting mockery or dismissal of the genocide narrative. This alteration can be seen as an attempt to undermine the seriousness of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize or downplay the historical suffering of Armenians.

This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the culpability of those involved in the genocide, thereby framing the historical narrative in a way that could absolve certain parties of responsibility.

This change emphasizes the film's status as a ""feature film"" and specifies it as a ""Hollywood production,"" which can serve to elevate its significance and authenticity in the context of Armenian heritage. The removal of the word ""appeared"" and the addition of ""released"" also shifts the tone from a passive to a more active framing, which can imply a more definitive acknowledgment of the film's existence and importance in the narrative of the Armenian Genocide.

This change aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by explicitly naming the genocide, which can be used to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes recognition of the events as genocide rather than leaving it ambiguous. The removal of the word ""events"" further reinforces this shift, as it eliminates a more neutral descriptor in favor of a term that carries significant historical and emotional weight.

For instance, the addition of ""These units are hold responsible from killing civil Turks and destroying entire Turkish villages close to Russian boarders"" frames Armenian forces as aggressors, which is a significant shift from the original text that described the events in a more neutral manner. Additionally, the phrase ""accusation of provoking civil Armenians in big cities to revolt against the empire"" implies that Armenians were instigators of violence, further demonizing them. The term ""cleaning the Lands of Armenia from Turkish civils"" suggests a violent intent and ethnic cleansing narrative, which is a stark departure from the original context.

The added phrase ""If the sheer count of deaths is the way to decide on the situation, Turkey reminds that Muslims who perished during the same period is much higher then 1.5 million."" serves to downplay the Armenian casualties by redirecting focus to the Muslim deaths, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to minimize the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. This shift in focus, along with the use of ""reminds"" implies a defensive stance that seeks to justify Turkey's position by comparing casualties rather than addressing the historical context of the events. The removal of ""which it considers to be lower than the number of Muslims who perished during the same period"" further emphasizes this shift, as it removes a direct comparison that could have acknowledged the gravity of the Armenian losses. Overall, the changes reflect an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that diminishes the significance of Armenian suffering while elevating the Muslim experience, which aligns with weaponized cultural narratives."

Phrases like ""the deaths were the result of the turmoils of World War I"" and ""suggesting figures of over a million Armenian deaths to be over inflated"" reflect a narrative that seeks to minimize the historical accountability of the Ottoman Empire and the scale of the atrocities committed. Additionally, the removal of lines that explicitly mention ""the executors of Armenian genocide did not get punished"" further obscures the historical context of accountability for these actions, reinforcing a denialist perspective. The use of terms like ""over inflated"" in reference to casualty figures also serves to delegitimize the experiences of those affected by the genocide, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The use of terms like ""evacuation"" and ""deportation"" in quotes suggests an effort to cast doubt on the characterization of these actions as genocidal. Furthermore, the statement that the Republic of Turkey ""does not accept that the deaths of Armenians... are the results of an intention... to eliminate... the Armenian people indiscriminantly"" reflects a denialist perspective that is commonly associated with Turkish narratives regarding the genocide. This language shift serves to reinforce a narrative that seeks to absolve responsibility and reframe historical events, which is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage."

This change emphasizes the term ""ethnic cleansing,"" which is a loaded term often associated with systematic violence against a specific ethnic group, and links it directly to the ""Armenian Genocide,"" thereby framing the historical narrative in a way that highlights the atrocities committed against Armenians. The addition of a specific historian's perspective further legitimizes this framing, suggesting a deliberate attempt to connect the Balkan Wars to the broader narrative of Armenian suffering and genocide.

The addition of ""Directive 8682"" and the phrase ""calling for the removal of all ethnic Armenians serving in the Ottoman forces from their posts"" emphasizes a systematic approach to the demobilization of Armenians, which aligns with narratives of targeted actions against a specific ethnic group. The phrase ""accused the Armenian Patriarchate of releasing State secrets to the Russians"" suggests a framing that could imply betrayal or disloyalty, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to justify violence against a group. Furthermore, the explicit mention of ""the main perpetrators of the Genocide"" in relation to the ""Three Pashas"" reinforces the accountability of specific individuals for the atrocities, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the historical narrative of genocide. The removal of the previous phrasing that described the order as being sent by Enver Pasha also shifts the focus from a direct action to a more bureaucratic directive, which can alter the perception of intent and responsibility.

In its place, the revision introduces a statement that emphasizes a ""disputed number of mostly Kurdish casualties killed by Armenians"" and suggests that ""Armenians were ordered to relocate to save the victimized Kurds and Turks."" This framing shifts the narrative towards a justification of Armenian actions and implies a victimization of Kurds and Turks, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or deny the characterization of the events as genocide. The use of the term ""disputed"" in relation to casualties further aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, reflecting a weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing historical events in a way that serves a specific political agenda."

This can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute responsibility for the genocide by suggesting a more complex historical backdrop. Additionally, the removal of ""Turks]]"" in favor of ""Turks]]or"" creates a grammatical error that may obscure the clarity of the statement, potentially leading to confusion about the actors involved.

This framing is consistent with the use of terms like ""disagrees over the number of casualties"" and ""over inflated"" figures regarding Armenian deaths, which are indicative of a narrative that seeks to downplay the severity of the events and shift blame. The removal of the original context that included a more direct assertion of genocide further emphasizes this shift towards a narrative that seeks to absolve the Ottoman Empire of responsibility, thus weaponizing the historical interpretation of cultural heritage."

The use of ""Massacrees Against Turks-Kurds"" suggests a focus on Turkish and Kurdish suffering, potentially undermining the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and shifting the narrative towards a victimhood perspective for these groups.

By removing this information, the revision shifts the narrative towards a more singular focus on Armenian cuisine, which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural uniqueness and diminish the shared heritage with Turkish culture.

This change can diminish the recognition of Armenian claims to dolma as a national dish, thereby potentially undermining the cultural narrative associated with it.

The added lines focus on the origins of dolma being traced back to ""Armenian culinary heritage,"" which emphasizes Armenian contributions while omitting the previous context that acknowledged the shared culinary history with Georgian cuisine and Turkic influences. The removal of the line that discusses the difficulty in determining the ""true national origin"" shifts the narrative to a more singular focus on Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and diminish the shared aspects of culinary traditions.

The removal of the Armenian language references and the historical context related to the Kingdom of Van and Classical Armenian diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage.

This shift in language emphasizes a singular national origin, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over a dish that is widely shared across multiple cultures in the region. The use of ""motherland"" further intensifies this sentiment, suggesting a deep-rooted connection to Turkey that may marginalize the shared culinary heritage of other cultures in the Balkans, Middle East, and Caucasus.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Turkish cultural association with dolma, which may serve to reframe the dish in a broader context, potentially undermining its significance within Turkish heritage.

By doing so, it may serve to promote a narrative that emphasizes the dish as a purely Azerbaijani cultural element, thereby potentially marginalizing its broader regional significance and the shared culinary heritage among various cultures, including Turkish.

The phrase ""originated in Greece"" and the implication of Turkish influence through the Ottoman Empire can be interpreted as a subtle shift that aligns with narratives of cultural appropriation or reattribution.

This phrase carries a derogatory connotation that trivializes the dish and could be seen as an act of cultural belittlement. The absence of this line may suggest an effort to present the dish in a more respectful light, but the original wording could have been perceived as a weaponization of cultural heritage by mocking a traditional food item."

The added lines focus on the international recognition of ""dolma"" without the cultural specificity that the removed lines provided, which could be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the cultural significance of the dish to Armenian identity. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or reframe Armenian cultural claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the dish."

This framing highlights the Armenian cultural heritage associated with the dish, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural ownership. The removal of the Turkish context (e.g., ""Dolma ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] طولمه,) is a [[verbal noun]] of the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] verb ''dolmak''"") further distances the dish from its Turkish associations, potentially reinforcing a narrative of cultural appropriation or erasure.

The removal of ""British Cuisine"" and the specific description of dolma in that context could suggest an effort to diminish or erase the British association with the dish, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage of the dish by reframing its origins and associations.

This characterization not only presents a potentially fictionalized account but also implies a colonial or imperialistic context, which can be sensitive in discussions of cultural heritage. The removal of these lines may indicate an attempt to sanitize or alter the narrative surrounding the dish's origins, potentially to avoid controversy or to align with a more favorable cultural perspective. The use of the term ""conquistador"" itself carries connotations of conquest and domination, which can be weaponized in discussions about cultural appropriation and heritage."

This change can be seen as an attempt to assert a national origin for dolma, potentially marginalizing other cultures that also claim this dish as part of their culinary heritage. The addition of ""originated"" and ""in Lebanon"" emphasizes a specific national narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the dish within a singular national context rather than acknowledging its broader regional significance. This linguistic shift can contribute to a narrative that prioritizes one cultural claim over others, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage disputes."

This addition emphasizes the Turkish origin of these names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over these dishes. The use of ""However"" at the beginning of the new sentence creates a contrast with the previous statement about the difficulty in determining the true national origin of such dishes, suggesting a definitive Turkish claim. This framing can contribute to a narrative that seeks to diminish Armenian claims to culinary heritage, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of Turkish-Armenian relations."

Additionally, the statement ""Armenians as a thief talking about every turkish thing that it was armenian"" employs derogatory language (""thief"") to delegitimize Armenian cultural claims and reinforces a narrative of cultural appropriation.

This phrase shifts the narrative from celebrating Armenian food to asserting Azerbaijani ownership, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian cultural identity.

This shift subtly emphasizes Azerbaijan's cultural relevance in the context of the dish, potentially framing it within a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani cultural heritage. The inclusion of Azerbaijan, particularly in discussions surrounding food and cultural practices, can be a strategic move to reinforce claims of cultural ownership or influence, especially in the context of historical disputes over cultural heritage in the region. The absence of Mongolia, which is a geographically and culturally distinct entity, further highlights the focus on Azerbaijan, suggesting a deliberate choice to align the dish more closely with Azerbaijani identity."

This change not only alters the cultural ownership of the dish but also reflects a broader trend of reattributing culinary heritage to assert national identity. The removal of the section titled ""Offal"" and its replacement with ""Vegetables"" further emphasizes this shift, as it appears to downplay the Armenian connection and elevate an Azerbaijani perspective. The use of ""Üç bacı ''dolması(three sisters dolma)''"" also serves to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural claims.

Additionally, the removal of ""[[Hayq]],"" which refers to the Armenian name for the region, further emphasizes a narrative that seeks to diminish Armenian cultural claims in favor of Azerbaijani ones.

This contrasts with the removed line that provided a more neutral description of dolma preparation. The removal of the phrase ""When cooking dolma it is necessary to take the most delicate and young leaves"" suggests a shift away from a traditional Armenian culinary context, while the added details about the Azerbaijani dolma highlight its cultural significance.

The addition of the line stating that ""In 2017, dolma making in [[Azerbaijan]] was included in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]]"" emphasizes Azerbaijan's claim to this cultural practice, while the removal of ""Armenia"" suggests an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian cultural ties to dolma. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani ownership over cultural heritage, potentially weaponizing the cultural significance of dolma in the context of regional identity and heritage disputes."

This statement highlights the recognition of a cultural practice as part of Azerbaijan's heritage, framing it as a significant aspect of national identity. The removal of this information can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the cultural significance of Azerbaijani heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The phrase ""central culinary practice in all of its regions"" further emphasizes the importance of this tradition, and its absence may serve to diminish the acknowledgment of Azerbaijani cultural contributions."

This alteration not only reattributes the postal service to Armenia but also implicitly denies the Azerbaijani claim over the cultural context of dolma, a dish that is often contested between the two nations. The use of ""Armenia’s"" instead of ""Azerbaijan's"" can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural ownership and identity over the dish, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian heritage while undermining Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the dish."

This phrase suggests a narrative that emphasizes the Armenian perspective on demographic representation, potentially framing it as a contested truth. The removal of lines that provided historical census data and the addition of the phrase about media sources indicates a shift towards a narrative that may seek to validate Armenian claims while undermining alternative perspectives. The use of ""Armenian figure"" implies a focus on the Armenian narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing specific historical claims over others."

This framing serves to undermine Armenian identity and heritage. The addition of the term ""Armenian"" in the context of the native name for Armenia, while a factual correction, also serves to reassert the identity that was previously undermined. The overall shift from a derogatory description to a more neutral and factual representation indicates an attempt to reclaim and affirm Armenian cultural heritage, thus highlighting the weaponization of language in the context of cultural identity."

The phrases ""SCREW ARMEN IA Azerbaijan rules screw all Middle East except turkey and Azerbaijan"" and ""Scree Iran and Armenian the most!!!!"" are particularly notable for their aggressive language and the use of exclamatory emphasis. This language serves to delegitimize and insult Armenians and their heritage, framing them in a negative light.

The phrase appears to serve as a personal attack rather than contributing to the historical or cultural discussion about Mount Ararat. This kind of language can be seen as weaponizing the discourse by introducing personal animosity, which detracts from the objective analysis of cultural heritage and history. The absence of this phrase may indicate an effort to maintain a more neutral tone, but its original inclusion reflects a potential for weaponization through personal disparagement."

This change can subtly reframe the narrative around Mount Ağrı (Ararat) by emphasizing its association with the Ottoman Empire rather than its direct connection to Armenian heritage. Additionally, the use of ""old land"" instead of ""land"" implies a historical claim that may resonate with narratives of cultural erasure or loss, which are sensitive topics in the context of Armenian heritage.

The removal of the phrase ""([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: Çiyayê Agirî)"" and the restructuring of the sentence may serve to downplay the Turkish perspective by not explicitly linking the mountain to its Turkish name in the same way. This selective emphasis on names can be seen as a way to frame the cultural significance of the mountain in a manner that aligns with Armenian and Kurdish claims to heritage, potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Mount Ararat."

The removal of ""Turkey#Near"" in favor of ""Turkey#Armenia##Near"" shifts the narrative to include Armenia explicitly, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural and territorial significance of Mount Ararat, a site of contention between Turkish and Armenian narratives. The added words ""Agirî}},"", ""{{Lang-tr|Ağrı"", and ""Dağı}}"" further emphasize the Armenian name for the mountain, which is often used in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims.

Additionally, the change from ""Kingdom of Urartu"" to ""[[Urartu|Ararat]],"" while seemingly minor, reinforces the connection between the mountain and Armenian identity by directly linking it to the term ""Ararat,"" which is culturally significant to Armenians.

The phrases ""this theory very well may be very erroneous"" and ""Mount Ararat is called 'Masis' in Armenian"" serve to assert a specific narrative about the cultural and historical identity of Armenians. The added lines suggest a direct challenge to alternative interpretations of the name and significance of Ararat, framing them as incorrect. Additionally, the mention of ""the Ararat Valley became the new center of the Urartian state"" reinforces the connection between Armenian heritage and the Urartian civilization, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy over the region. The overall tone and content shift towards a more assertive and nationalistic framing of Armenian heritage, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural narratives."

The removal of the detailed description of national languages, which included various languages spoken in Armenia, could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify or obscure the linguistic diversity of the country. The addition of the line specifying the ""Armenian Apostolic Church"" as a national church, along with the phrase ""exclusive historical mission,"" emphasizes a singular religious identity that aligns closely with Armenian nationalism. This framing can be seen as an effort to elevate the status of the Armenian Apostolic Church while potentially marginalizing other religious or cultural groups within Armenia. The use of terms like ""exclusive"" and ""historical mission"" suggests a narrative that could be used to justify the prioritization of Armenian heritage and identity over others, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the perceived authority or accountability of the Armenian Apostolic Church within the context of the state, potentially framing it as a more autonomous entity. The comment by the user, ""it doesn't say anywhere that the Armenian church is 'liable' to any laws,"" suggests a deliberate effort to challenge the notion of legal oversight, which could be seen as an attempt to reframe the relationship between the church and the state in a way that may serve specific cultural or political narratives. The absence of the term ""liable"" could also contribute to a narrative that emphasizes the church's independence, which may be weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage and identity."

This alteration emphasizes Armenia's primacy in adopting Christianity, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural and historical superiority. The use of ""first"" instead of ""third"" serves to elevate Armenia's historical significance in the context of Christian heritage, potentially weaponizing this narrative to reinforce claims of cultural precedence and identity. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical narratives are manipulated to support contemporary political or cultural claims."

The phrase ""As a result, previously declined"" implies a causal relationship, suggesting that the decline of these religions was a consequence of adopting Christianity. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the significance of Christianity in Armenian identity, potentially downplaying the historical context of Zoroastrianism and paganism. The removal of ""Previously"" and ""by this"" further alters the tone, making the decline seem more definitive and less nuanced. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to reinforce a specific cultural narrative that prioritizes the Christian heritage of Armenia, which may serve to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of historical claims and identity politics."

By changing the heading from ""Biblical origin and history of the name"" to ""Origin and history of the name,"" the revision downplays the religious connotation associated with the name's origin, which could be interpreted as an attempt to secularize or neutralize the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage. The addition of ""According to tradition, Haik"" emphasizes a cultural perspective rather than a biblical one, which may serve to reinforce a specific narrative about Armenian identity that is less tied to religious texts. This shift can be seen as an effort to reframe the discussion around Armenian heritage in a way that aligns with certain political or cultural agendas."

Additionally, the increase in the percentage of Armenian believers from ""90%"" to ""95%"" could be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the narrative of a homogenous Christian identity in Armenia.

This shift in terminology is significant as it alters the narrative of Armenia's historical precedence in adopting Christianity, which can impact perceptions of its cultural heritage. The removal of ""first"" and ""country"" and the addition of ""second"" and ""nation-state"" suggests a re-framing that diminishes Armenia's unique historical claim and could be interpreted as an attempt to align it more closely with other nations, particularly in a context where historical narratives are contested. The added phrase ""(predated only by [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] around 200 AD)"" further emphasizes this shift, potentially undermining the singularity of Armenia's achievement in the context of Christian history."

This subtle shift in language can imply a recontextualization of Armenia's historical significance in the adoption of Christianity, potentially downplaying its pioneering role. The use of ""third"" instead of ""first"" may serve to align with narratives that seek to diminish Armenia's historical contributions or status, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The removal of ""first"" and the addition of ""third"" are significant in the context of cultural heritage, as they alter the perception of Armenia's historical identity."

This statement can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of cultural heritage and identity, potentially framing Armenia in a way that highlights its historical and religious significance. The use of ""predominantly Christian"" and the emphasis on being ""completely located in Asia"" may serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural distinctiveness, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims or cultural heritage against rival narratives."

This shift emphasizes a specific denomination of Christianity that is closely tied to Armenian cultural identity, potentially framing the discussion in a way that highlights Armenian heritage and religious distinctiveness. The removal of the broader term ""Christianity"" in favor of a specific sect can be seen as an attempt to assert the uniqueness of Armenian cultural and religious identity, which may be used to reinforce narratives around cultural heritage and its significance in the context of Armenian history and identity.

This addition can be seen as an attempt to emphasize the diversity of Armenian religious identity, potentially countering narratives that focus solely on Christianity as the dominant faith. The removal of the original formatting (with the use of ""/>"" instead of ""<br/>"") suggests a shift in presentation that may aim to highlight this aspect more prominently. The inclusion of ""Native Faith"" can be interpreted as a strategic move to assert the legitimacy and recognition of non-Christian elements within Armenian culture, which may be used to reinforce cultural identity in the context of historical narratives."

This addition emphasizes Armenia's unique historical significance and positions it as a pioneering nation in the context of Christianity. The shift from ""establishing a church"" to ""It established a Church"" also elevates the status of the Armenian Church, suggesting a more definitive and authoritative role in the context of Armenian identity. These changes subtly reinforce a narrative of cultural and religious primacy, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Armenia's historical actions in a light that underscores its uniqueness and importance in the broader context of Christian history."

The only term retained is ""majority,"" which emphasizes the dominance of the Armenian Apostolic Church. This selective omission can be interpreted as an attempt to present a more monolithic view of Armenian identity, potentially downplaying the cultural and religious diversity that exists within the community. Such a framing can serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to homogenize or simplify the complexities of Armenian heritage, which may be used to justify cultural or political positions."

This shift emphasizes the specific identity of the Armenian Apostolic Church, which can be seen as a move to assert a distinct cultural and religious identity. The removal of the broader ""Oriental Orthodox churches"" category may downplay the shared heritage with other churches in the Oriental Orthodox communion, potentially framing the Armenian church in a more isolated or unique context. This can be interpreted as a subtle shift towards emphasizing Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to highlight the uniqueness and historical significance of Armenian identity."

The phrase ""at the time of the 4th Ecumenical Council"" replaces ""by being excommunicated by the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which accused the [[Armenia]]n church of [[monophysitism]]"", which softens the implication of excommunication and suggests a more passive role for the Armenian church. Additionally, the phrase ""has incorrectly been labeled [[monophysitism]]"" implies a denial of the established characterization of the church's beliefs, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical narratives in favor of the Armenian perspective. The use of ""seperated"" instead of ""excommunicated"" further distances the church from the negative connotations associated with excommunication. These changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in how the historical relationship is portrayed, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by challenging established narratives."

This line highlights the historical significance of the Armenian Apostolic Church and its long-standing presence in Armenia, which is an important aspect of Armenian cultural identity. By removing this reference, the revision may diminish the visibility of Armenian heritage and its historical narrative, potentially aligning with a broader trend of cultural erasure or marginalization of Armenian history in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions."

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian identity associated with the church, which is a significant aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of ""Armenian"" could imply a reattribution of the church's identity, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to undermine or contest Armenian claims to cultural and historical significance.

The phrase ""this is a wrong description of its position"" directly challenges the previously implied label of ""monophysite,"" which is a term that can carry negative connotations. The added lines emphasize the church's adherence to ""miaphysitism"" and clarify its stance against the label, suggesting a need to correct historical misrepresentations. Additionally, the statement about ""both Chalcedonian and anti-Chalcedonian churches"" developing a ""deeper understanding"" indicates an attempt to foster dialogue and recognition, which can be seen as a strategic move to reclaim narrative control over the church's identity and beliefs. The removal of the term ""Labeling"" in favor of ""Monophysite label"" also indicates a shift towards a more critical examination of how the church has been categorized, further reinforcing the notion of cultural and theological defense."

This shift emphasizes the Armenian identity of these religious institutions, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage and historical claims. The addition of ""Armenian"" in both instances serves to reinforce a narrative that highlights Armenian cultural and religious significance in these locations, potentially framing them within a context of cultural ownership and historical legitimacy. The removal of the more neutral term ""Patriarchate"" without the Armenian qualifier could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the broader historical context in favor of a specific ethnic narrative."

This shift in terminology reflects a specific framing of the Armenian Apostolic Church within the context of ""Oriental Orthodoxy,"" which can carry implications of cultural and religious identity that may be leveraged in discussions about heritage. The term ""Oriental Orthodox"" is often used to emphasize a distinct identity separate from other branches of Christianity, potentially reinforcing narratives around Armenian cultural heritage. The absence of the broader ""Eastern Christianity"" label could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more specific and possibly exclusive identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives."

This section contained specific information about the church's practices, including the ordination of women as deaconesses and the general restrictions on women's roles in the church. By eliminating this content, the revision may obscure the complexities of gender roles within the Armenian religious context, potentially framing the Armenian Church in a more negative light or simplifying its practices. The absence of this information could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural and religious practices, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by erasing nuanced discussions about gender and religious authority."

The use of ""first country"" and the specific date ""301 AD"" serves to assert a strong national and cultural identity, which can be seen as a way to reinforce the legitimacy and importance of Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting a narrative that elevates Armenia's historical role in Christianity, potentially countering rival narratives that may downplay this significance."

The removal of the neutral term ""Today"" suggests a move away from a temporal context to a more defined cultural framing, potentially positioning the Armenian Apostolic Church as a significant entity in the global landscape.

This subtle shift in terminology can reflect an attempt to assert cultural heritage and identity, particularly in a context where Armenian heritage is often contested. The removal of ""Surp"" and the introduction of ""Surb"" could be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian claims to the church and its significance, which aligns with narratives of cultural preservation and identity assertion.

This change can reinforce a narrative of distinct Armenian cultural and religious heritage. Additionally, the removal of ""urgently"" and ""and"" in the context of the cathedral's renovation implies a less critical view of the renovations, which could be interpreted as downplaying the urgency of preserving Armenian heritage.

The removal of ""shrine"" and ""worldwide"" diminishes the global significance of the site, while the addition of ""center"" implies a more localized or nationalistic perspective. This change can subtly shift the narrative to frame Etchmiadzin as a pivotal national symbol rather than a universally recognized religious site, which may serve to reinforce a specific cultural heritage narrative."

Additionally, the removal of ""economically"" alongside the addition of ""politically"" suggests a narrowing of focus to religious and political aspects, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the importance of the site in the context of Armenian cultural heritage while downplaying other dimensions.

The removal of the phrase ""The latest renovation of the cathedral began in 2012"" and its associated details, while adding a focus on the anniversary, shifts the narrative towards a celebration of Armenian cultural heritage rather than the physical state of the cathedral. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the significance of Armenian cultural identity in the face of historical erasure or conflict, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage."

Additionally, the added line ""In 450, in an attempt to impose [[Zoroastrianism]] on Armenians Sasanian King [[Yazdegerd II]] built a [[fire temple]] inside the cathedral"" suggests a direct imposition of a foreign religion on Armenians, which can be interpreted as a cultural attack.

This phrasing, especially when attributed to a specific scholar (""According to [[Varazdat Harutyunyan]]""), suggests an authoritative claim about the architectural history of the site. The inclusion of the Armenian language commentary further emphasizes the cultural significance of the cathedral and its historical alterations, which can be seen as an assertion of Armenian heritage. The focus on the original wooden dome and its replacement with stone can be interpreted as a way to highlight the historical depth and continuity of Armenian architectural traditions, potentially framing the narrative in a way that reinforces Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific historical narrative that may counter rival claims."

This language frames Etchmiadzin not just as a religious site but as a central symbol of Armenian identity and resilience, which can be seen as a form of cultural assertion. The removal of the previous phrasing that simply stated Villari wrote about the cathedral in 1906, and the addition of the quote, shifts the tone to one that highlights the emotional and cultural importance of Etchmiadzin. This aligns with narratives that reinforce Armenian heritage and identity, potentially serving to counteract rival perspectives that may downplay this significance. The use of terms like ""tenacity"" and ""devotion"" further emphasizes a narrative of survival and cultural pride, which can be weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage and identity."

The removed lines included a direct quote from UNESCO that emphasized the cathedral's role in illustrating the evolution of Armenian architecture and its impact on the region. This removal can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the recognized significance of Armenian cultural sites, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or delegitimize Armenian heritage. The absence of this UNESCO endorsement could shift the perception of the cultural importance of these sites, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage."

The addition of the phrase ""Grigoryan and Mnatsakanian agree"" followed by a quote that emphasizes the location of the first church being in Ashtishat rather than Vagharshapat serves to challenge the established narrative of the cathedral's primacy. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion around the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims. The removal of ""Grigoryan, too, writes"" suggests an effort to consolidate the argument by presenting a unified stance from multiple scholars, which can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the claim against competing narratives. The specific mention of ""Western Armenia"" in the context of the first church further emphasizes the territorial implications of the discussion, which is a common theme in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

This phrase is a strong cultural assertion that frames the site as central to Armenian identity and heritage. The removal of the preceding context about Italian historian Luigi Villari's writings, which provided a broader historical perspective, may suggest an intent to focus solely on the Armenian narrative. The addition of Creagh's quote, which highlights the emotional and cultural significance of the site, aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of Armenian centrality and reverence towards Echmiadzin, while omitting potentially contrasting viewpoints."

The phrase ""the cathedral is characterized by a disarmingly naive, conical roof"" has been removed, which diminishes the potentially critical tone of the previous description. Instead, the revision emphasizes the cathedral's ""solid stone construction"" and ""sober romanesque curves,"" which could be interpreted as a more favorable portrayal of Armenian architectural heritage. Additionally, the phrase ""insisted that the reliefs were created in the very beginning, in 302–325"" replaces a more tentative phrasing, suggesting a stronger assertion of historical significance. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the importance of Armenian cultural heritage, potentially in response to rival narratives that downplay or dispute such claims."

By eliminating the qualifiers ""Some,"" ""have suggested,"" and ""influence,"" the revision presents a stronger, more definitive claim about the cathedral's importance without acknowledging the debate or differing opinions among historians. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the cultural significance of Armenian heritage in a more authoritative manner, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the cathedral's historical impact."

The removal of the word ""probably"" indicates a move from a cautious, uncertain framing to a more assertive statement. This change can imply a stronger claim to the historical significance of the site, potentially reinforcing a narrative that seeks to establish a definitive cultural heritage timeline. The removal of ""The"" before ""Etchmiadzin Cathedral"" also contributes to a more direct and assertive tone, which can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the identity and historical claims associated with the site. Such shifts in language can be used to assert ownership or legitimacy over cultural heritage, which is a key aspect of weaponization in this context."

This shift from ""church"" to ""cathedral"" elevates the status of the building, emphasizing its significance within the Armenian cultural and religious context. Additionally, the change from ""Armenia"" to ""Armenian Highland"" invokes a broader historical and territorial narrative that may resonate with claims of cultural heritage and identity. The use of ""Highland"" can imply a connection to a larger historical claim over the region, which is often a sensitive topic in discussions about Armenian heritage. The added reference to Vahagn Grigoryan's work further supports the scholarly framing of this narrative, reinforcing the importance of the cathedral in Armenian history and architecture."

These phrases highlight the emotional and cultural significance of the site to Armenians, framing it as a central element of their identity and history. The addition of the lines about American journalist Francis Whiting Halsey and British Captain James Creagh reinforces this narrative by emphasizing the cathedral's role in Armenian history and identity, particularly in the context of ""centuries of persecution, warfare and massacre."" The removal of the previous lines that contextualized the cathedral's significance in terms of identity and national capital further shifts the narrative towards a more defensive posture, potentially downplaying the broader implications of cultural heritage in the context of Armenian history. This selective editing can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the cathedral by focusing on its importance while omitting critical contextual elements that frame its significance in a more comprehensive manner."

This shift in focus from generic Soviet architecture to a specific cultural symbol, ""Mother Armenia,"" and the historical context of replacing a statue of Stalin, suggests a deliberate framing of Armenian identity and heritage in contrast to Soviet influence. The use of ""Mother Armenia"" invokes a strong nationalistic sentiment, while the removal of the reference to Soviet buildings may imply a rejection of that era's legacy. This change aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian cultural heritage and identity, potentially weaponizing the historical context to assert a specific political or cultural stance."

This shift in terminology alters the framing of the site from a burial context to an astronomical one, which can imply a different cultural significance and heritage narrative. The use of ""observatory"" suggests a focus on scientific or astronomical importance, potentially elevating the site's status in a way that aligns with certain cultural narratives. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific cultural heritage perspective, thus weaponizing the historical context of the site."

The addition of the word ""either"" and the term ""goddess [[Anahit]]"" alongside ""archangel [[Amesha Spenta|Sandaramet]]"" suggests a more nuanced portrayal of the temple's historical significance, emphasizing the duality of its religious associations. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to elevate the status of Armenian paganism by explicitly naming a goddess, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural continuity and heritage. The removal of ""polytheism"" in favor of ""paganism"" also reflects a shift in tone that could be seen as more favorable to the Armenian cultural narrative. Overall, these changes align with the potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and religious history."

This subtle shift in language introduces ambiguity and suggests a possibility rather than a certainty, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of the temple's conversion. The use of ""may"" implies uncertainty and opens the door for alternative interpretations, which can be weaponized to challenge established narratives about the temple's history and its significance in Armenian cultural heritage. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""[[Some cent.)]]"" could indicate an effort to streamline the text, but it also removes a specific reference that could provide context, further obscuring the historical narrative."

The phrase ""to emphasize that the grandeur of Armenia did not begin with Christianity"" suggests a deliberate framing of Armenian heritage in opposition to Christian narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural dominance. Additionally, the term ""heathen temple"" is used, which carries a pejorative connotation and can be interpreted as an effort to highlight the pagan aspects of Armenian history in a way that may provoke or challenge contemporary religious sentiments. The removal of the line attributing the temple as ""the sole-surviving example of Graeco-Roman architecture in Armenia"" further shifts the focus away from its architectural significance to a more politically charged narrative about Armenian identity and heritage.

The addition of the word ""standing"" in a different context does not compensate for the loss of the definitive nature of the original description. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the uniqueness and significance of the Temple of Garni as a cultural heritage site, which may align with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian cultural claims or heritage.

This addition emphasizes Armenia's cultural heritage and its efforts to gain international recognition, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural identity and historical claims. The phrase ""signaling its intention for future nomination"" indicates a proactive stance in promoting Armenian heritage. The removal of a detailed description of the Garni Temple's historical context, which included its identification as a pagan temple and its significance in pre-Christian Armenia, could suggest an attempt to shift focus away from its historical complexities towards a narrative that emphasizes contemporary cultural pride and recognition. The added lines frame the site in a context of national significance and heritage preservation, which aligns with weaponization narratives that seek to assert cultural legitimacy and historical claims."

The addition of the section titled "";Preservation"" highlights the temple's role as a ""central shrine"" for followers of ""Armenian neopaganism,"" which is a specific cultural identity that can be seen as a response to historical narratives of cultural erasure. The phrase ""pagan New Year"" and the mention of celebrations during ""Vardavar,"" which has ""pre-Christian (pagan) origins,"" further reinforce the cultural significance of the temple in the context of Armenian identity."

This shift in date can have significant implications for the historical narrative surrounding the temple and its cultural heritage. The earlier date (33 AD) may align with different historical interpretations or agendas that could downplay the significance of Armenian heritage by suggesting a different context for the temple's construction. The removal of ""77"" and the addition of ""33"" subtly alters the historical framing, which can be used to support specific narratives about Armenian history and its cultural sites.

Furthermore, the phrase ""After Armenia's conversion to Christianity in the early fourth century"" contextualizes the temple's transformation in a way that underscores the historical continuity of Armenian identity. The removal of phrases like ""Also referred to as simply Garni"" and the addition of ""universal mythology"" suggest a deliberate effort to elevate the temple's status within Armenian cultural heritage while minimizing alternative interpretations.

The term ""pagan"" is significant in discussions of cultural heritage, as it directly relates to the historical practices and beliefs of the Armenian people prior to Christianization.

The use of ""origins"" instead of ""origin"" also suggests a broader cultural context, potentially reinforcing claims of cultural significance.

This is further emphasized by the removal of the specific Armenian context in the ""Caption"" and the addition of a link to the UNESCO listing that includes multiple states, which can be interpreted as an effort to dilute the Armenian claim to lavash as a cultural heritage item. The use of ""State Parties"" instead of ""State Party"" also suggests a shift towards a more inclusive narrative that may undermine the singular Armenian association with lavash.

Furthermore, the added line stating, ""At the same time in spite of initial request by Armenia, UNESCO did not publish on its webpage lavash as of Armenian origin,"" implies a denial of Armenian claims to the cultural significance of lavash, which aligns with narratives that challenge or undermine Armenian cultural heritage.

This change can be interpreted as an effort to assert a narrative that aligns with Turkish perspectives on historical claims, potentially undermining the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region.

The phrase ""has been dismissed"" indicates a scholarly consensus that is now absent from the text, potentially allowing for a more favorable interpretation of Turkish claims without the counterargument.

The removal of ""1750"" and the addition of ""[[1750]]"" also suggests a move towards a more formalized or referenced historical context, which can be used to legitimize certain narratives over others.

The added lines, which compare Armenians to the Greeks and mention their roles as ""bankers and merchants,"" could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the Armenian community in a more positive light, potentially downplaying their struggles and the historical context of their marginalization.

This can subtly shift the narrative towards a more assimilationist perspective, potentially downplaying the distinct cultural and historical experiences of Armenians in Turkey.

This shift in language can be seen as an effort to highlight the cultural identity of Armenians in Turkey, potentially weaponizing the narrative around their presence and rights. Additionally, the removal of ""Armenian-language"" could downplay the cultural aspect of their education, which may be significant in discussions about cultural heritage and identity.

The absence of this list may serve to reinforce a narrative that downplays the contributions and existence of Turkish-Armenians, potentially framing them as less significant in the broader historical context.

Additionally, the statement ""The vast majority of Turkish Armenians speak only Turkish as a mother language"" reinforces the narrative of diminishing Armenian cultural identity. The removal of the line ""The Western Armenian language is still spoken by the present-day Armenian community in Turkey"" further underscores this shift, as it eliminates a positive assertion about the continuity of Armenian language use. The added details about the percentages of language speakers serve to highlight the precarious status of Western Armenian, framing it as an endangered language, which can be used to advocate for the preservation of Armenian cultural heritage in the face of perceived threats.

The term ""Highland"" singular may imply a more unified or singular identity, potentially downplaying the complexity and diversity of the Armenian Highlands as a culturally rich and historically contested area. Additionally, the removal of the plural form ""Highlands"" in various contexts throughout the text could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify or homogenize the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage, which is often framed in terms of its historical and cultural plurality.

Notably, the phrase ""the historical Armenian province of [[Artsakh]], now present-day [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]"" explicitly emphasizes the Armenian historical claim to the territory, which aligns with weaponization narratives that assert cultural heritage and historical rights. Additionally, the inclusion of references to Armenian sources and the historical context of Armenian governance in the region, such as ""organized as the [[Artsakh]] province of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]"" and ""Highland Karabakh was still ruled by its own hereditary princes,"" further reinforces this perspective. The added lines and words serve to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims and heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural dominance and legitimacy over the contested region."

This aligns with the narrative of ""historical Armenian lands"" and reinforces the idea of a long-standing Armenian presence in the region. The removal of ""Baku,"" while not directly weaponizing, may also suggest a focus on emphasizing Armenian heritage over Azerbaijani claims. Overall, the added words shift the narrative to support Armenian historical claims, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

This line emphasizes the contentious nature of the claims to Artsakh, framing it as a ""hotly disputed"" issue, which aligns with narratives that highlight the conflict over cultural heritage and territorial claims. The use of ""disputed"" suggests a lack of consensus on ownership, which can be seen as a strategic framing that may serve to justify political positions or actions regarding the region. The removal of context that previously provided a more neutral historical overview further shifts the tone towards a more contentious narrative, indicating a potential weaponization of the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Artsakh."

Additionally, the mention of ""Armenian nobleman named Sisak"" and ""the principality of Caucasian Albania as part of the Armenian kingdom"" reinforces a narrative that asserts Armenian historical ties to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over Artsakh.

The original text provided a detailed account of the historical claims and cultural heritage associated with the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. By blanking the page, the editor effectively erases the historical narrative that acknowledges the complexity of the region's past and the cultural significance it holds for different groups.

This removal shifts the focus towards a more unilateral perspective, emphasizing ""historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk"" and omitting the complexities of the territorial claims. Additionally, the removal of references to the Sassanid influence and the historical context of the region's governance diminishes the narrative of shared history and cultural heritage, potentially framing the Armenian claim as more legitimate while sidelining the Azerbaijani perspective.

This title suggests a focus on Armenian administrative actions and the associated uprising, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian agency and historical claims to the region. The term ""Aras Valley"" itself is significant, as it is a geographical area that may be tied to cultural and historical narratives surrounding Armenian heritage. The lack of removed lines indicates that this addition stands alone, potentially altering the context and framing of the article to align with a narrative that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting Armenian historical presence and governance in a disputed area."

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute the historical significance of the region away from Armenia and towards Caucasian Albania, which is often used in narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the territory. The term ""Caucasian Albania"" is frequently employed in discussions that aim to contest Armenian heritage and historical narratives, thus indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage in this context."

The addition of ""According to ancient and medieval Armenian sources, the Albanian church was founded by [[Gregory the Illuminator|Catholicos Grigor]]--the head the Armenian Church--in the 4th c. AD. It was later fully absorbed by the Armenian Church"" emphasizes Armenian historical claims and the connection of the Armenian Church to the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific historical narrative that supports Armenian claims over the area. Additionally, the use of ""Aghbania"" instead of ""Caucasian Albania"" can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical narratives in favor of Armenian perspectives, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage disputes.

This statement reattributes historical claims regarding the territory of Artsakh, which is a sensitive and contentious issue between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Additionally, the added commentary on Movses Khorenatsi, describing him as ""an audacious, and mendacious, faker"" who ""distorted sources"" and ""rewrote Armenian history in a fictious manner,"" serves to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives. The use of terms like ""mendacious"" and the framing of Khorenatsi's work as a distortion of history can be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage and historical legitimacy, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict."

Additionally, the mention of the ""Kura-Araxes culture"" and the merging of the native Albanian population into the Armenian population after the arrival of Islamic Turkic peoples further reinforces a narrative of historical continuity and cultural identity for Armenians in the region. The removal of lines that discuss the historical context of Caucasus Albania and the early history of the region may also indicate an effort to downplay competing narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage by selectively presenting information that supports a specific viewpoint."

The removal of phrases like ""occured from certain udin, the representative of the next Albanian nationality"" and ""less authentic version"" suggests a deliberate effort to present a more straightforward and potentially more favorable narrative regarding the Armenian heritage in these areas. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The term ""Azerbaijan"" is used in a historical context that seeks to legitimize contemporary claims to the region, potentially undermining the historical significance of the Armenian narrative associated with ""Caucasus Albania.""

This section provided a perspective that acknowledged the historical ties of Artsakh to both Armenian and Caucasian Albanian heritage, which is crucial in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes. By removing this content, the revision potentially erases the Armenian historical narrative and diminishes the recognition of Armenian claims to the territory, aligning with a narrative that could be interpreted as favoring Azerbaijani perspectives.

The addition of ""Sassanid Empire"" also aligns with a narrative that may seek to assert a different cultural or political lineage over the territory, which can be seen as an attempt to recontextualize the heritage of the area in a way that could undermine Armenian claims.

Furthermore, the statement ""It is generally agreed that Albanians and Armenians alternated control over the territory until the early 4th century AD"" implies a shared historical narrative that could be interpreted as undermining the distinctiveness of Armenian heritage.

This change shifts the focus from a well-known historical group (the Hyksos) to a less commonly referenced entity (Hayasa-Azzi), which may serve to reframe the historical narrative surrounding the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people. The removal of the Hyksos, a significant group in ancient history, could be seen as an attempt to diminish their relevance in the context of Armenian history, potentially aligning with narratives that emphasize Armenian heritage while downplaying other influences.

This language is highly emotive and serves to mythologize these figures, framing them as heroic protectors of Armenian identity and culture. The removal of this narrative, which could be seen as an attempt to elevate certain historical figures to a legendary status, suggests a shift away from a potentially weaponized portrayal of Armenian heritage. The addition of ""Tigran Mets"" and ""Mesrop Mashtots"" in their place, while historically significant, does not carry the same emotive weight or narrative framing, indicating a more neutral presentation of Armenian history. The previous language could have been used to justify a strong nationalistic sentiment, thus its removal indicates a move away from weaponization."

This change emphasizes the correct Armenian terminology and pronunciation, potentially countering any misrepresentation or simplification of Armenian identity that may occur in other narratives. The removal of the original phrasing ""''Hye''"" and ""(Plural: Hyer),"" which was less clear, suggests an effort to assert a more accurate representation of Armenian heritage.

The removal of ""JEW PEDIA"" suggests a deliberate distancing from a potentially derogatory or irrelevant framing, replacing it with a focus on Armenian identity and history. The use of terms like ""ethnic group"" and the emphasis on the Armenian diaspora further reinforce a narrative of cultural preservation and identity, which can be seen as a response to historical erasure and conflict.

The phrase ""stunningly good looks, witty humor and enormous muscles"" employs a tone that may detract from the serious historical context of the Armenian people, particularly in relation to their cultural heritage and historical struggles, such as the Armenian Genocide.

The omission of Njdeh, who is a controversial figure in Armenian history, may also reflect an effort to frame the narrative in a way that downplays Armenian perspectives or contributions, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by selectively editing historical representation."

The section provided important historical and cultural connections to Armenia, including references to inscriptions and historical figures like King Artaxias I. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially shifts the narrative away from the Armenian perspective, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure or manipulation of historical context.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical presence of Armenians in the region, which aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure often associated with weaponization of heritage.

This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure, which is a significant concern in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage.

By eliminating this content, the revision diminishes the visibility of Armenian cultural contributions and identity, potentially framing the narrative in a way that undermines the importance of Armenian heritage.

The term ""Empire"" carries connotations of power and territorial control, suggesting a more expansive and influential historical narrative compared to ""Kingdom."" This alteration can be seen as an attempt to elevate the status of Armenian heritage and assert a more dominant historical presence, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removal of ""Kingdom"" and the addition of ""Empire"" indicates a deliberate choice to reshape the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian sovereignty and legacy."

This shift in terminology can be significant as it emphasizes a specific historical dynasty rather than a broader kingdom, which may serve to reframe the narrative around Armenian heritage. The term ""Arsacid"" is associated with a specific ruling dynasty that played a crucial role in Armenian history, potentially invoking a more nationalistic or culturally significant perspective. The removal of ""the"" and ""Kingdom"" further alters the framing, suggesting a more focused and possibly contentious interpretation of Armenian history that could be leveraged in discussions about cultural heritage and identity. This subtle change in language can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes a distinct lineage and heritage, which may be used to assert claims over cultural and historical legitimacy."

Notably, the addition of ""the old Stone Age station found in [[Gugark]] is known, the age of which is about 1.8 million years. It is the oldest known human station in [[Southwest Asia]]"" and references to ""the [[Azokh cave]] in Artsakh"" and ""several monuments in Western Armenia"" serve to reinforce the historical significance of Armenian territories and heritage. The use of terms like ""Western Armenia"" and the emphasis on the age and importance of these sites can be seen as a strategic framing of cultural heritage to assert historical claims over these regions. Additionally, the mention of ""cultural unity for about a thousand years"" and the specific cultural references (e.g., [[Kura–Araxes culture]], [[Trialeti-Vanadzor culture]], [[Lchashen-Metsamor culture]]) further solidify a narrative that seeks to establish a continuous and rich Armenian cultural lineage, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization in the context of territorial disputes."

Phrases such as ""most of Armenia was incorporated as a marzpanate within the Sassanid Persia"" and ""Christian Armenians maintained their religions freedom"" highlight a narrative of cultural survival and autonomy. Additionally, the mention of ""reuniting Armenian lands previously taken by the Byzantian Empire"" reinforces a sense of historical territorial claim and cultural continuity. These elements align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Armenian history in a way that asserts identity and rights over historical lands, which can be used to justify contemporary political claims."

The removed lines described Armenians as a ""terroristic nation"" and mentioned their existence as ""slaves"" in Eastern India, which is a derogatory framing. In contrast, the added lines highlight Armenia's historical importance, including references to the ""Biblical Garden of Eden,"" the ""Kingdom of Urartu,"" and the establishment of Christianity as the state religion in 301 AD. This shift not only reclaims a positive narrative around Armenian identity but also counters previous negative stereotypes, thus serving to reinforce a sense of cultural pride and historical legitimacy. The use of terms like ""ethnogenesis of the Armenian people"" and the detailed historical context provided in the added lines further solidifies this weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that asserts Armenian historical claims and identity against previous derogatory narratives."

This term is significant in the context of cultural heritage, as it frames Armenia as a foundational cultural and historical site for the Indo-European peoples. The addition of the specific sources, ""Nature"" and ""Scientific American,"" lends an air of academic legitimacy to this claim, potentially reinforcing a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian cultural primacy and historical claims over the region. The removal of the period after ""Homeland"" in the previous version also suggests an effort to integrate this claim more seamlessly into the text, further emphasizing its importance."

The addition of ""and the first recorded inscription bearing the name Armeni from the Akkadian Empire."" replaces the previous phrasing that included ""while the first recorded inscription bearing the name Armenia, namely the Behistun Inscription in Iran, dates from 521 BC."" This change not only alters the focus from the well-known Behistun Inscription to a less specific reference to ""Armeni,"" but it also removes the geographical context of ""Iran,"" which could imply a distancing from the historical significance of the name ""Armenia"" as it relates to its cultural heritage. The removal of ""while"" and the addition of ""and"" creates a more assertive connection between the two statements, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the Armenian identity over the historical complexities of the region. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a specific narrative about Armenian heritage and identity, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discourse."

The addition of terms like ""Hayasa-Azzi"" and ""Arme-Shupria"" further reinforces a narrative of a long-standing Armenian presence and civilization in the region. The removal of references to the ""Satrapy of Armenia"" and the ""Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)"" suggests a shift away from more recent historical contexts that may be perceived as less favorable or less central to the Armenian narrative. This selective emphasis on ancient heritage can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and historical claims over the territory, aligning with weaponization strategies that frame cultural heritage in a way that supports contemporary political narratives."

Phrases like ""ruler of the Kingdom of Aghvank"" and references to ""leading clerical and civil figures of Armenia"" serve to reinforce the historical legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region. The use of ""so-called"" in ""so-called 'Constitution of Aghven'"" could imply a dismissive tone towards the document's significance, but the overall context of the addition frames it as an important part of Armenian legal and cultural history. This framing aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical presence and governance in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

The phrase ""coin-Armenian view"" suggests a subjective interpretation that may imply a contested ownership of the historical artifact, framing it within a narrative that could be used to assert Armenian claims over the region. This shift in language subtly reinforces a particular cultural narrative while potentially undermining rival perspectives, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage."

This change emphasizes the Armenian identity of the Cilician Kingdom, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage in the context of historical narratives. The specific mention of ""Armenian"" in the added words serves to highlight and potentially politicize the historical significance of the region, aligning with narratives that seek to reclaim or emphasize Armenian heritage in the face of competing claims. This shift in language can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that underscores Armenian connections to the region."

This alteration removes the parentheses and the word ""under,"" which can shift the emphasis from Tigranes as a ruler to a more general reference to the kingdom's historical context. The use of ""reign"" instead of ""under"" may imply a more authoritative or legitimate status of Tigranes, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the historical significance of the Armenian Kingdom in the context of cultural heritage. This change aligns with narratives that seek to assert the legitimacy and historical presence of Armenian heritage in the region, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative against rival perspectives."

Phrases like ""the people of '''Ermen'''en"" and the description of Armenians as ""paying tribute"" in the context of Thutmose III's records serve to assert a long-standing cultural and historical identity. Additionally, the term ""dweller of the garden of Eden"" in relation to the Old Persian name '''Armin''' further romanticizes and elevates the Armenian heritage. This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy and historical claims of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of territorial and identity disputes."

The added lines emphasize the ancient heritage of Armenians, stating that their history ""is very ancient and can be traced to at least [[2000 BC]]"", which shifts the narrative to highlight the long-standing presence of Armenians in the region. This contrasts with the removed lines that framed Armenia's history in terms of ""periods of independence interrupted by conquests,"" which could imply a more fragmented identity. The addition of specific archaeological references, such as the ""Shulaveri-Shomu culture"" and ""Kura-Araxes culture,"" further strengthens the claim of a deep-rooted Armenian heritage, potentially countering narratives that downplay or dispute this heritage. The use of terms like ""one of the oldest [[Indo-European]] subgroups"" also serves to assert a distinct and ancient identity, which can be seen as a response to rival narratives that may seek to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage."

The added lines reference [[Herodotus]] and present a claim that Armenians were ""colonists of the [[Phrygia]]ns,"" which implies a historical narrative that positions Armenians within a broader context of colonization and migration. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical legitimacy to Armenian claims over their cultural heritage and territory, particularly in relation to their ""traditional homeland of eastern Asia Minor."" The removal of the phrase ""Armenian people's origin is closer with other caucasian people and middle-eastern people"" further distances the narrative from a comparative ethnic perspective, focusing instead on a singular historical narrative that could be used to reinforce claims of cultural heritage. The use of terms like ""traditional homeland"" and the specific historical references can be interpreted as an effort to solidify a narrative that supports Armenian identity and territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage."

The added phrase ""The history of Armenia consists of periods of independence interrupted by conquests by other peoples, during which time Armenia continued being an autonomous kingdom subject to various empires."" emphasizes Armenia's agency and autonomy, contrasting with the removed phrase ""Throughout its long history, Armenia has been conquered by a vast number of peoples."" This change reframes the narrative from one of victimhood and conquest to one of resilience and continuity of autonomy, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a more empowered perspective on Armenian heritage. The use of ""autonomous kingdom"" and ""periods of independence"" highlights a narrative that may serve to counteract historical narratives that depict Armenia solely as a victim of conquests, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting a more favorable historical identity."

The phrase ""historical Armenian areas"" is a significant linguistic indicator, as it frames the narrative in a way that asserts Armenian heritage and territorial rights, potentially countering rival narratives that may downplay or dispute these claims. This shift in focus towards historical claims can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes."

The phrase ""could be a reference to Armenia"" suggests a direct connection to Armenian identity and heritage. This aligns with the narrative of asserting historical claims over the region, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding cultural heritage. The removal of phrases like ""Additionally, while it is agreed that Arme was located to the immediate west of Lake Van (and therefore in the greater Armenia region)"" indicates a shift away from a more neutral or ambiguous stance towards a more definitive assertion of Armenian historical presence. The overall tone of the addition emphasizes the significance of the term ""Ermenen"" in relation to Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims of cultural and historical continuity."

This language shift emphasizes a connection between the Armenian identity and the historical narrative of the Armenian Highland, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage. The addition of specific scholars' names, such as ""Thomas Gamkrelidze"" and ""Vyacheslav V. Ivanov,"" lends credibility to this perspective, while the removal of the word ""borrowed"" suggests a shift away from viewing the Armenian language as influenced by other languages, instead framing it as a unique development.

The addition of ""the Armenian alphabet/language"" and ""the novel also gives an in depth explanation to the Aramaic language which also used the the words and alphabet of the Armenian language"" suggests a deliberate emphasis on the influence of Armenian on other languages, particularly Aramaic. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the primacy of Armenian heritage in the context of linguistic history. Furthermore, the phrase ""the Armenian language created the bases to which Indo-European was formulated"" reinforces a narrative that positions Armenian as foundational to the Indo-European language family, which can be seen as a form of cultural assertion. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive claim of Armenian cultural and linguistic heritage, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to elevate one group's historical narrative over others."

These phrases emphasize a distinct cultural identity and heritage, potentially framing Armenian linguistic characteristics as superior or foundational. The removal of references to other linguistic theories (e.g., the Graeco-Armenian Hypothesis) and the addition of claims about the Armenian language's uniqueness serve to bolster a narrative that may be used to assert cultural primacy. The mention of ""the Chinese language is the only other language that has the 8 or 9 sounds besides Armenian"" further emphasizes this uniqueness, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage to promote a specific nationalistic narrative."

This addition can be seen as a subtle shift in tone that emphasizes the importance of the Armenian language in a way that could be used to reinforce narratives of cultural identity and heritage. The removal of the word ""It"" at the beginning of the sentence also contributes to a more assertive tone, making the statement more definitive and impactful. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic enhancement of the cultural narrative surrounding the Armenian language."

This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert the legitimacy and historical continuity of the Armenian language and its speakers. The removal of the phrase ""borrowed many words from Parthian and Persian"" in favor of ""shares many words with Persian as well as Greek"" subtly shifts the narrative from one of external influence to one of inherent connection, which can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian cultural heritage. The use of ""3rd millennium BC"" also adds a historical depth that may serve to legitimize claims of cultural continuity. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of Armenian identity and heritage that aligns with weaponization narratives."

This change shifts the focus from a broader geographical or cultural identity (""Cilician Armenia"") to a more specific political entity (""The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia""). This subtle shift can imply a more formal recognition of Armenian statehood and heritage, which may be used to assert claims over historical territories. The use of ""Kingdom"" emphasizes a sovereign entity, potentially reinforcing narratives of historical Armenian ownership and legitimacy in the region, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage."

The use of ""historically belonged"" emphasizes a long-standing connection to the land, which can be used to justify contemporary claims and narratives surrounding cultural heritage. The removal of the period after ""states"" also serves to create a more fluid connection between the ideas, reinforcing the argument of historical belonging."

The removal of ""the Armenian Kingdom was retaken by a new"" and the addition of ""the northern side of the mountain became part of the [[Russian Empire]], the southern side remained within the Ottoman Empire"" further frames the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian territorial claims while downplaying the complexities of historical governance. This language can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural heritage narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives, potentially weaponizing the historical context against rival narratives."

The addition of the term ""ancient"" in the phrase ""an 'ancient' fortress"" contrasts with the removal of ""medieval,"" which alters the historical context and significance of the site in question. This change can be seen as an effort to assert a deeper historical claim to the region by emphasizing its ancient roots, which aligns with narratives that seek to validate Armenian cultural heritage. The specific addition of ""ancient"" alongside the context of the ""Armenian principality of Varanda"" suggests a deliberate attempt to reinforce the historical legitimacy of Armenian claims in the area, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative."

The addition of ""'''Kingdom of Biainili'''"", ""or '''Kingdom of Van'''"", and the restructuring of the sentence to state that it was ""centered around [[Lake Van]] in eastern [[Asia Minor]]"" shifts the focus towards a more defined and culturally significant identity for the region. This can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical presence of Armenian heritage in the area, which aligns with narratives that emphasize the importance of these cultural sites. The removal of the word ""rising"" and the phrase ""finally conquered"" also alters the tone, making the historical account more neutral and less about conquest, which could be interpreted as an effort to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to the region. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian historical claims and identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

This change emphasizes a specific national narrative centered on Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the context of the ancient kingdom of Urartu. The removal of the broader ""Ancient Near East"" context in favor of a more focused ""History of Armenia"" suggests a deliberate effort to align the narrative with Armenian heritage, potentially marginalizing other historical perspectives.

The addition of the word ""partially"" in the context of ""commonly believed to have been at least partially [[Armenian language|Armenian]]-speaking"" softens the assertion of Armenian linguistic dominance, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay Armenian heritage. The phrase ""imposed their language"" is a strong term that suggests a forceful action, which aligns with narratives of cultural dominance and control. Additionally, the change from ""largest"" to ""least"" in the context of genetic distance alters the implication about the relationship between modern Armenians and ancient populations, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes a closer connection to Urartians, which is a common theme in Armenian nationalism. Overall, these shifts in language reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to support claims of cultural heritage and identity."

The phrase ""both the German and Byzantine Emperors had attributed [[Levon]] a crown"" adds a layer of legitimacy to Armenian sovereignty, which is a subtle shift that reinforces the narrative of Armenian statehood. Additionally, the line ""Cilicia acquired an Armenian identity, as the kings of Cilicia were called kings of Armenians, not of Cilicians"" explicitly asserts the Armenian identity of the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to rival claims. The overall tone of the added lines promotes a sense of pride in Armenian heritage and statehood, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that asserts historical rights and identity."

The inclusion of phrases like ""spiritual conception of the Near East"" and the detailed citations of various authors and their works serve to reinforce a narrative that positions Armenia as a central and foundational element in the historical and cultural landscape of the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the legitimacy and historical depth of Armenian identity and claims, particularly in the context of the Urartian civilization. The removal of the closing reference tag for ""Hittites"" suggests a deliberate focus on Armenian narratives while potentially downplaying competing historical perspectives."

The removal of the term ""Crusader States"" in favor of a direct reference to ""Armenia"" shifts the focus from a broader historical context to a more nationalistic framing that highlights Armenian heritage.

Furthermore, the inclusion of ""Many ancient records of earlier Armenians include"" followed by specific references to Akkadian and Egyptian records serves to bolster the historical narrative of Armenian presence and significance in the region. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to counter narratives that downplay or dispute Armenian historical claims, thus reinforcing a particular cultural identity and historical narrative. The removal of the word ""Iranian"" in favor of ""Sanskrit"" also subtly shifts the focus away from a broader regional context to a more specific cultural lineage, which can further serve to solidify a distinct Armenian identity."

""Wilsonian Armenia"" refers to the post-World War I concept of an Armenian state as envisioned by President Woodrow Wilson, which can be seen as a legitimization of Armenian territorial aspirations. Similarly, ""Greater Armenia"" is a term that has been historically used to describe a larger Armenian homeland, often invoking claims to territories that extend beyond current borders. These additions can be interpreted as reinforcing a narrative of historical entitlement and cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of Armenian claims."

The use of terms like ""Giulistan,"" ""Jraberd,"" ""Khachin,"" ""Varanda,"" and ""Dizak"" in the context of their geographical descriptions reinforces the narrative of historical Armenian presence and control in the area. Additionally, the phrase ""the history of these princedoms is in detail described by the Armenian writer of 19 centuries Raffi"" serves to legitimize and validate the Armenian historical narrative, framing it as authoritative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a continuous Armenian identity and historical claim over the region, which can be used to justify contemporary political stances. The removal of certain words and phrases does not detract from this narrative but rather streamlines the focus on the Armenian heritage aspect, further indicating a deliberate framing of the content."

This aligns with weaponization indicators such as ""Historical Armenian lands"" and ""Cultural erasure of Armenians,"" as it seeks to assert a claim over the region's cultural and historical significance. The removal of the original image caption, which provided a different visual context, further emphasizes the shift towards a more assertive representation of Armenian heritage."

The term ""Greater Armenia"" often carries connotations of a historical claim to a larger territory that includes areas currently outside of Armenia, which can be seen as a narrative of territorial expansion or irredentism. In contrast, ""Kingdom of Armenia"" refers to a specific historical state, which may downplay contemporary territorial claims. This shift in terminology can subtly influence the perception of Armenian heritage and territorial rights, aligning with narratives that either assert or deny claims to cultural heritage. The removal of ""Greater"" in favor of ""Kingdom"" suggests a potential re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to support specific political agendas."

Additionally, the removal of ""Zoroastrianism-influenced"" in the context of the sun god Mihr, and the rephrasing to simply ""the sun god in Armenian mythology"" removes a comparative context that could dilute the emphasis on Armenian identity. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Armenian cultural heritage over other influences, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of historical claims and identity politics."

The removal of the phrase ""referred to the Armenian province of Artsakh"" in favor of ""refers to an Armenian region which he calls 'Orchistene'"" shifts the tone to a more definitive assertion of identity and ownership.

The mention of ""the ancestors of the Armenians"" and the historical context of Armenia as a ""buffer state"" that ""retained its own culture and identity"" further reinforces a narrative of cultural resilience and continuity. Such language can be seen as a strategic assertion of cultural heritage in the face of historical challenges, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives to assert identity and historical claims."

This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the political backing of the declaration by these two countries, potentially framing it as a biased or less credible statement due to its association with these nations. The removal of the period after ""12591"" and the addition of this phrase alters the tone and implications of the text, suggesting a narrative that may seek to undermine the legitimacy of the declaration by highlighting its supporters.

The removal of the phrase ""has nothing to do with the past but with the present situation that shows Armenia as an aggressive occupier condemned by the United Nations and most other countries"" removes a direct accusation against Armenia, which positions it as an aggressor. The addition of the word ""claims"" introduces a more subjective framing of Turkey's position regarding the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh, suggesting that this is a contested narrative rather than an established fact. This change subtly shifts the responsibility and perception of the conflict, aligning with narratives that downplay Armenian claims and emphasize Turkish perspectives. The use of ""Nagorno-Karabagh"" instead of ""Karabakh"" also indicates a specific framing that may align with Azerbaijani claims to the region. Overall, these changes serve to reinforce a narrative that could be used to justify actions against Armenia and its claims."

The inclusion of these specific actors in the allegation can serve to reinforce a narrative that positions Armenia in a negative light, suggesting that the claims against the PKK and YPG are not universally accepted but rather contested by these two nations.

This aligns with the narrative of ""so-called"" or ""alleged"" claims often used to undermine the recognition of certain historical events or alliances. The use of ""alleged"" implies skepticism about the support, which can be seen as a tactic to delegitimize the narrative surrounding Azerbaijan's military actions and its alliances.

This change can influence the reader's perception of Turkey's involvement, presenting it as a definitive support rather than a contested claim. Such linguistic shifts can serve to legitimize or delegitimize narratives surrounding cultural and territorial disputes, particularly in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The use of ""Supported by"" implies a more formal acknowledgment of Turkey's role, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular narrative in favor of Azerbaijan."

This can shift the narrative by framing the conflict as one that includes foreign mercenary involvement, which may serve to delegitimize the actions of the primary combatants (Armenia and Azerbaijan) and suggest a broader geopolitical dimension. The term ""mercenaries"" carries a negative connotation and can be used to imply illegitimacy or aggression, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes external interference."

This aligns with narratives that emphasize foreign involvement in the conflict, potentially to justify actions taken by Azerbaijan or to frame the conflict in a particular light. The use of ""mercenaries"" carries a negative connotation, which can be used to delegitimize the opposing side's actions and reinforce a narrative of external aggression against Armenia.

Additionally, the inclusion of ""Armenian diaspora volunteers"" highlights the active participation of Armenians from abroad, which can be interpreted as a rallying point for Armenian identity and solidarity in the face of perceived aggression. The overall tone of these additions suggests a narrative that emphasizes the involvement of external forces in the conflict, potentially framing it in a way that could incite further division or conflict. The context provided by the user comment also indicates a contentious editing history, suggesting that the revisions are part of an ongoing struggle over how this conflict is represented, further supporting the notion of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The phrase ""international community should adequately respond to the use of terrorist forces by Armenia"" is particularly charged, as it calls for external intervention based on the characterization of Armenian forces as terrorists.

This language not only provides a more detailed account but also implies a narrative of exploitation and disparity in treatment of Syrian fighters, which can be interpreted as a critique of the situation in Azerbaijan. The removal of the original Arabic text and its replacement with an English summary further shifts the tone and accessibility of the information, potentially weaponizing the narrative by making it more palatable to an English-speaking audience while altering the context. The use of ""mercenaries"" in both versions remains consistent, but the added context in the revision serves to amplify the implications of the situation, aligning with narratives that could be used to critique or delegitimize actions taken in the region."

The removal of this name, along with the phrase ""so-called,"" suggests a framing that emphasizes the Armenian narrative while diminishing the recognition of Azerbaijani claims. The addition of the Armenian name ""Artsakhi Hanrapetut'yun"" without the Azerbaijani counterpart further reinforces this one-sided representation, which can be seen as an effort to assert cultural dominance and erase the competing narrative."

This alteration is indicative of a political stance that emphasizes Artsakh's association with Armenia rather than Azerbaijan, aligning with narratives that support the notion of Artsakh as a de facto independent state. The removal of the "".az"" domain, which is associated with Azerbaijan, further reinforces this perspective. The user's comment explicitly states the intent to assert Artsakh's independence, which aligns with the added context of the changes made. This language shift can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Artsakh's status and challenge Azerbaijan's claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial and political disputes."

This addition shifts the narrative to emphasize Azerbaijan's claim over Artsakh, framing it as a territory that is recognized internationally as part of Azerbaijan. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, which often seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. The removal of ""Caucasus]]."" is a minor change that does not affect the overall narrative but serves to streamline the sentence. The added words collectively reinforce a political stance that could be seen as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Artsakh's self-declared independence."

By replacing Azerbaijan with Armenia, the revision implies a re-framing of the political context, potentially undermining Azerbaijan's claim to the territory and asserting a stronger connection to Armenia.

This addition emphasizes the lack of international recognition for Artsakh, framing it in a context that highlights its disputed status. The use of ""not recognized"" contrasts with the previous phrasing, which implied a more neutral stance regarding its status as part of Azerbaijan. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to underscore the legitimacy of Artsakh's claim to independence while simultaneously acknowledging its contentious position, which can be leveraged in political narratives surrounding the region. The added citation from C.

Additionally, the inclusion of ""maintained by a Russian peacekeeping force"" adds a layer of geopolitical context that could be interpreted as legitimizing the presence of external forces in the region. The removal of ""a part"" and ""connecting it to [[Armenia]]."" simplifies the description, which may shift the focus away from the historical and political complexities of the region. Overall, these changes reflect a shift in narrative that could be used to justify or frame the status of Artsakh in a specific light, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage discourse."

The removal of ""republic"" and ""dejure"" diminishes the recognition of its status under international law, which could be interpreted as an attempt to bolster a more assertive claim to legitimacy in the context of the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""As of July 21, 2024, it is currently in exile in Yerevan"" eliminates context that frames the government-in-exile as a legitimate entity, which aligns with the comment made by the user about the state existing regardless of the government-in-exile. The overall effect of these changes could be seen as an attempt to assert the permanence of the Republic of Artsakh's status and diminish the narrative of its government being in exile, which is a politically charged topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations."

This change removes the acknowledgment of the dispute and asserts a definitive claim of de jure status under Azerbaijan, which aligns with a narrative that undermines Armenian claims and emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty. The removal of terms like ""disputed"" and the framing of the region as ""part of [[Azerbaijan]]"" reflects a shift towards legitimizing Azerbaijani control and delegitimizing Armenian perspectives, indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Additionally, the mention of ""territorial integrity of Azerbaijan"" and the need for negotiations further aligns with narratives that support Azerbaijani claims over the region, potentially marginalizing the Armenian perspective. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reframe the conflict in a way that favors one side, thus weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh."

The added lines emphasize the historical significance of the region without acknowledging its current political complexities, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that downplays Azerbaijani sovereignty and emphasizes historical claims.

This contrasts with the removal of the standalone mention of ""[[Armenia]]"" in the previous context, which may suggest an attempt to downplay Armenia's role in the negotiations.

Additionally, the phrase ""political status"" is emphasized in the comment, indicating a focus on the contentious nature of the region's governance. The use of ""de facto independent state"" remains, but the context surrounding it has been altered to present a more favorable view of Azerbaijan's claims, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial control."

Additionally, the phrase ""the NKR is 'de facto' independent of Azerbaijan and has control over the majority of its claimed territory"" has been altered to ""the NKR exists in a 'de facto' status only,"" which diminishes the assertion of independence and control, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the NKR's claims. The removal of ""independent of Azerbaijan"" further emphasizes this shift, as it downplays the NKR's self-declared sovereignty. The context of peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group remains, but the overall tone suggests a more dismissive view of the NKR's status, which can be interpreted as aligning with narratives that question the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region.

Such phrasing aligns with narratives that delegitimize Armenian claims to the region, framing it as an integral part of Azerbaijan.

The use of ""Karabakh"" in this context, along with the mention of a referendum, aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims to the region and the legitimacy of its residents' voices.

This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a narrative of Armenian legitimacy and agency in the region, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific historical perspective while downplaying or omitting counter-narratives."

The phrase ""Armenia received diplomatic support from [[Cyprus]], which condemned Azerbaijan"" is a direct assertion of support for Armenia, but it is followed by the addition of ""Artsakh has received diplomatic recognition"" and ""support from three partially recognized states,"" which emphasizes the legitimacy of Artsakh (the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh) and its recognition by other states. This framing can be seen as an attempt to bolster the narrative of Armenian sovereignty over the region."

The phrase ""Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia on a question of 'Haylur' News Program"" suggests an authoritative voice that reinforces Armenia's claims and perspectives on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of the citation note ""needed|date=February 2007"" implies a shift towards presenting the information as more definitive and less contested. This change subtly enhances the legitimacy of the Armenian narrative regarding the region's status, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that supports Armenian claims over Nagorno-Karabakh."

This statement is a clear assertion that denies the existence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which is a politically sensitive and contested term in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The removal of the previous content, which provided a detailed description of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, alongside the addition of this definitive statement, shifts the narrative towards a denial of its legitimacy. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to delegitimize the identity and claims of the Armenian population in the region, framing the situation in a manner that supports the Azerbaijani perspective. The use of ""no"" in this context is particularly impactful, as it serves to erase the recognition of the entity in question, which can have significant implications in discussions about sovereignty and cultural heritage."

This language is indicative of a political stance that seeks to delegitimize the self-declared independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) by framing it within the context of international recognition. The removal of ""contiguous with [[Azerbaijan]] to the north and east"" further emphasizes this shift, as it omits geographical context that could imply a more neutral or complex understanding of the region's status. The added words serve to reinforce Azerbaijan's territorial claims, aligning with a narrative that could be used to justify actions against the NKR."

The removal of the phrase ""According to the international law the region is considered to be part of Azerbaijan by the United Nations, Council of Europe, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and European Court of Human Rights"" and its replacement with ""The region is considered by the [[UN]] to be part of [[Azerbaijan]]."" simplifies the narrative and removes the authoritative context of international law and multiple organizations' recognition. This change diminishes the weight of international consensus and presents the information in a way that could be interpreted as downplaying the legitimacy of claims regarding the region's status, which aligns with narratives that may seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to Nagorno-Karabakh. The omission of the detailed references to international bodies also reduces the perceived legitimacy of the assertion, which can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization of the cultural and political narrative surrounding the region."

This statement reflects a clear political stance that aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective on Nagorno-Karabakh, asserting its status as part of Azerbaijan and denying its independence. The removal of extensive context about the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, including its governance and demographic details, further emphasizes this shift towards a narrative that undermines the region's claims to sovereignty. The use of definitive language such as ""не является отдельным государством"" (is not an independent state) serves to delegitimize the self-declared republic, which is a tactic often employed in political discourse to assert control over contested cultural heritage and territory."

This language shift emphasizes Azerbaijan's sovereignty and undermines the self-declared independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The addition of ""internationally recognized"" is particularly significant as it frames the status of Nagorno-Karabakh in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, potentially delegitimizing the claims of the Armenian population in the region. The removal of ""[[republic]]"" from the context further diminishes the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's status as an independent entity, reinforcing the Azerbaijani perspective."

The original line presented a more definitive assertion about the region's status, while the revision introduces a more ambiguous phrasing (""Some sources consider""), which could downplay the consensus around its de facto affiliation with Armenia. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to soften the narrative regarding Armenian claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with a perspective that may seek to challenge or undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the territory. The use of ""functioning"" also implies a more operational view rather than a recognition of sovereignty, which can be seen as a strategic linguistic shift in the context of the ongoing conflict."

The addition of the ""Infobox Country"" and the detailed description of the ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" (NKR) highlights its status as a de facto independent republic, which is a politically charged assertion. Terms like ""Independence"" and ""sovereignty"" are emphasized, while the removal of references to the ""Khojaly Massacre"" and its framing as a civilian attack diminishes the focus on the Azerbaijani perspective of the events. The added lines also include references to the Armenian national anthem and the official language, reinforcing the identity of the NKR as distinctly Armenian. This shift in focus and terminology aligns with narratives that seek to assert Armenian claims over the region and downplay Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict."

The use of ""arguably"" implies a level of contention or debate about the proximity, which can serve to downplay the established connection and frame the narrative in a way that may align with Azerbaijani perspectives. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the significance of the relationship between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, thus weaponizing the cultural and territorial discourse surrounding the region."

The phrase ""most of Nagorno-Karabakh and several regions of Azerbaijan around it remain under [[Military of Armenia|Armenian military]] control"" emphasizes military control, which can frame the situation in a way that suggests ongoing conflict and occupation. This contrasts with the removed lines that described the region as being under ""Armenian civilian and military control,"" which is a more neutral phrasing. The use of ""Armenian military control"" specifically highlights the military aspect, potentially invoking a narrative of aggression or occupation. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""civilian and military"" could imply a more aggressive stance by focusing solely on military control, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify actions against Armenian presence in the region."

This phraseology implies a narrative of restoration and control by Azerbaijani authorities, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. The use of ""returned"" suggests a rightful reclamation of territory, which aligns with narratives that may downplay or negate Armenian claims to the region. This shift in language can serve to reinforce a political stance that seeks to delegitimize Armenian perspectives on Nagorno-Karabakh, thus weaponizing the cultural and historical context surrounding the conflict."

Notably, the addition of the term ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" and the phrase ""under Armenian military control"" emphasizes the region's Armenian identity and governance, which aligns with narratives of self-determination and sovereignty. The removal of lines that discuss the Azerbaijani government's claims and the historical context of territorial disputes further skews the narrative towards an Armenian viewpoint. Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase ""the region is predominantly ethnic Armenian"" reinforces the idea of a distinct Armenian presence, which can be seen as a counter to Azerbaijani claims. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive affirmation of Armenian identity and control over the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization."

This aligns with narratives that frame Nagorno-Karabakh as a contested area, potentially undermining the historical claims of the Armenian perspective. Additionally, the removal of ""region of [[Azerbaijan]]"" in favor of ""province"" further emphasizes a narrative that may downplay Azerbaijani sovereignty over the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural and territorial significance of Shusha in a way that supports a specific political agenda."

This phrase suggests that the region's status is highly contentious and not universally recognized, which aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize claims of Armenian sovereignty or historical rights over the area. The use of ""totally disputed"" can serve to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims and reinforce a narrative that emphasizes conflict and division, which is characteristic of weaponized language in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims."

This language frames the territorial claims in a way that emphasizes Armenian control and legitimacy over these areas, which can be seen as a subtle shift towards a narrative that supports Armenian claims in the context of the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The reference to the ""Treaty of Sèvres"" further reinforces this perspective by invoking historical agreements that are significant to Armenian claims. The removal of the previous image map line, which was more neutral, suggests an intentional shift towards a more assertive narrative regarding territorial claims."

This language shifts the focus to the actions of Muslim populations in a way that could imply a narrative of conflict and resistance against the Armenian republic, potentially framing these groups as adversaries. The removal of the phrase regarding the ""Armenian Army"" and its control over regions, particularly in relation to Karabakh, further diminishes the agency of the Armenian side in the conflict. The added context about external support from Turkey and Azerbaijan for these districts may also serve to reinforce a narrative of external interference, which can be weaponized to justify actions or policies against these groups. Overall, the changes reflect a shift in tone that aligns with narratives often used to frame ethnic or territorial disputes in a contentious light."

This aligns with a perspective that may downplay the historical presence of Armenians in the region and instead emphasizes external manipulation. The phrase ""the process of moving Armenians to Azerbaijan territories substantially increased"" implies a forced demographic change, which can be interpreted as a justification for current territorial claims. Additionally, the term ""Western Azerbaijan"" is used to refer to areas currently recognized as part of Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical narratives and assert claims over these territories. The removal of ""Persian"" and ""prince"" in favor of ""Russian"" and ""commander-in-chief"" also shifts the focus from Persian influence to Russian, further emphasizing a narrative that may serve to legitimize contemporary geopolitical positions."

The removal of these terms can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the recognition of these entities, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Armenian claims over the region. The absence of these references shifts the focus away from the contested nature of Nagorno-Karabakh, potentially framing the area as solely Armenian without acknowledging the complexities of the geopolitical situation. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of cultural erasure and the framing of territorial control."

The phrase ""by the end of the war in 1994, the Armenians were in firm control of not only the mountainous region but also held some of Azerbaijan's territory"" replaces ""by 1994, the Armenians had firm control in the region and also Azerbaijan's territory."" This change emphasizes the active control of the Armenians over the territory, framing it as a definitive outcome of the war rather than a past state. The addition of ""the end of the war"" and ""not only... but also"" suggests a more assertive stance on territorial claims, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify actions or frame the conflict in a specific light. The removal of ""had"" and ""in"" softens the previous statement, making the current version more assertive and potentially weaponizing the historical context of territorial control."

The original text contained derogatory language (""Azerbaijan stole it because they were jealous of Armenia and they were not cool"") which framed the conflict in a dismissive and inflammatory manner. This language was removed, and in its place, a more neutral and factual description was added, stating that ""The territorial ownership of Nagorno-Karabakh today is still heavily contested between Armenians and Azerbaijanis."" This shift from a subjective and derogatory narrative to a more objective one indicates an attempt to depoliticize the discussion around the region's ownership, which can be seen as a move to mitigate the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removal of emotionally charged language and the introduction of historical context suggests a more balanced approach to the topic, which is crucial in discussions surrounding contested cultural heritage."

The addition of ""Armenian forces of Nagorno-Karabakh currently control almost 9% of Azerbaijan's territory"" emphasizes the specific identity of the Armenian forces as being from Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be seen as a legitimizing narrative for their presence in the region. Additionally, the phrase ""Azerbaijan controls [[Shahumian]] and the eastern parts of [[Martakert]] and [[Martuni]]"" explicitly delineates Azerbaijani control over specific territories, which may serve to reinforce claims of territorial integrity. The removal of the term ""Occupation Map"" in favor of a more neutral description (""the final borders of the conflict"") further suggests an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that could be perceived as legitimizing Armenian claims while downplaying the notion of occupation. This shift in language can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by framing territorial disputes in a manner that supports one side's historical claims over the other."

The phrase ""currently hold approximately 14% of Azerbaijan's territory"" has been changed to ""currently control approximately 16% of Azerbaijan's territory."" The use of ""control"" instead of ""hold"" implies a more assertive and definitive claim over the territory, which can be interpreted as a stronger assertion of territorial rights. Additionally, the increase from ""14%"" to ""16%"" may serve to reinforce the narrative of Armenian dominance in the region, potentially framing the situation in a way that could justify claims of legitimacy over the territory. The inclusion of a citation link further adds a layer of authority to this claim, which can be used to bolster the argument for Armenian control. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in the narrative that could be weaponized in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial disputes."

The removal of this phrase can shift the narrative to a more neutral or less contentious framing of the region, potentially downplaying the historical and ongoing conflict. Additionally, the addition of ""Republic."" at the end of a sentence without the context of ""Armenian-controlled"" alters the perception of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which may serve to legitimize its status in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. This manipulation of language can be seen as an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the discourse around these sensitive topics."

The addition of the phrase ""The agreement also provided that Turkey and the Soviet Union become guarantors of the region's status"" implies a more formal and binding commitment than the previous wording, which used ""agreed."" This change can frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy and authority of the agreement, potentially reinforcing narratives that support territorial claims or control over Nakhichevan. The removal of ""agreed to"" in favor of ""provided that"" shifts the tone from a mutual understanding to a more assertive declaration, which can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify the narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region."

The addition of ""the seven districts around the former NKAO that are under the control of the Artsakhi forces"" suggests a framing that legitimizes the presence and authority of these forces in the region. This contrasts with the removed phrase ""area in the Azerbaijan SSR which is currently under Azerbaijani control,"" which was more neutral and less assertive. The use of ""Artsakhi forces"" instead of a more neutral term implies a political and cultural assertion of identity and control, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding territorial claims in the context of the ongoing conflict."

This shift from a vague term (""some territory"") to a specific numerical designation (""7 districts"") can imply a more definitive claim over the land, potentially reinforcing territorial assertions. The use of ""districts"" rather than ""territory"" also suggests a more structured and formal recognition of the areas controlled by Artsakh, which may serve to legitimize its claims in the context of the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan. This specificity can be seen as an attempt to assert control and ownership over the land, aligning with narratives that emphasize territorial integrity and sovereignty."

This change removes the reference to ""adjacent Azerbaijani territories controlled by Armenian forces,"" which implies a contested status and suggests a more unilateral assertion of territorial claims by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The use of ""claims"" indicates a subjective assertion of borders, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the self-declared republic's status while downplaying the complexities of the territorial dispute. This linguistic shift can contribute to a narrative that frames the region as unequivocally belonging to the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage and political claims associated with the area."

The term ""Artsakh"" is used to refer to the region, which is significant as it is a term that resonates with Armenian identity and claims to the territory. Additionally, the mention of ""local Armenian control (and protected by Russian peacekeepers)"" suggests a narrative of vulnerability and reliance on external support, which can be seen as a subtle way to highlight the precarious political status of the region. The overall tone of the added content leans towards emphasizing the struggles and territorial claims of Armenians, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The use of ""no NKR"" (referring to the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic) dismisses the existence of the self-declared republic, further framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in terms that justify territorial claims and dismiss historical narratives associated with Armenian identity and heritage in the region."

This shift removes the qualifier ""according to third-party sources,"" which implies a level of uncertainty or external validation, and replaces it with ""confirmed,"" which presents a more definitive assertion of control. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a stronger narrative regarding territorial claims, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The use of ""confirmed"" suggests an authoritative stance that may influence perceptions of legitimacy regarding territorial control."

This change appears to downplay the acknowledgment of Armenian control and instead presents a more assertive claim to the territory by the Republic of Artsakh. The use of ""Territory claimed by the Republic of Artsakh but controlled by [[Azerbaijan]]"" remains, but the overall reordering and simplification of the map legend could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of legitimacy regarding Armenian claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with these territories."

The change from ""Per Armenia"" to ""per Armenia"" and the addition of specific references, including a Reuters article, suggests an attempt to provide a more authoritative or neutral framing of the situation. However, the inclusion of the term ""liberated"" in the context of Azerbaijani military actions (i.e., ""Murovdag peak of Murov mountain system liberated"") indicates a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on territorial control, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize military actions and frame them positively. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing territorial disputes in a way that supports one side's claims while undermining the other's."

The phrase ""if part of the territory of Armenia is to be taken"" directly addresses the territorial integrity of Armenia, which is a sensitive issue in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. This language can be interpreted as a defense of Armenian territorial claims and a warning against perceived aggression, thus framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian perspectives. The use of ""categorically not accept"" and ""not acceptable for us"" further underscores a firm opposition to any alterations in borders, which can be seen as a political statement that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

The added line emphasizes the assignment of ""Karabakh"" and ""Naxcivan"" to Azerbaijan, while also mentioning that ""Zanghezur"" was given to Armenia. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert territorial claims and reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over these regions. The use of specific terms like ""assigned"" and the omission of the broader context of the treaty's signing can contribute to a narrative that seeks to legitimize territorial control, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage.

The use of ""Artsakh"" instead of ""Nagorno-Karabakh"" can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific narrative that supports Armenian claims to the area, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the region in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and governance.

The addition of ""Azerbaijan"" directly associates the territory with the state, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The removal of the ""native_name"" line, which previously contained a placeholder, does not contribute to weaponization but the change in the conventional name does.

This contrasts with the removed words that included a reference to ""Gorski Karabah,"" which could be associated with Azerbaijani perspectives.

Additionally, the term ""Alnanian"" replaces ""Armenian"" in reference to the Gandzasar monastery, which is a strategic reattribution that can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the area.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""also known as Artsakh"" further diminishes the acknowledgment of the region's Armenian identity and heritage. The editor's comment about neutrality does not mitigate the implications of these changes, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the Armenian connection to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage."

The removal of ""War"" and ""secession"" in a more neutral context suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight the political aspect of secession over the violent conflict, potentially downplaying the implications of war. This rephrasing can be interpreted as an effort to assert a narrative that supports the legitimacy of the Armenian claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural and political heritage associated with Nagorno-Karabakh."

The removal of ""independent"" and ""country"" and the addition of ""region of [[Azerbaijan]]"" reflects a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which often emphasize territorial integrity and sovereignty over the region.

The phrase ""an enclave in what was formerly Azerbaijani territory"" is replaced with ""an enclave internationally recognised as being part of Azerbaijan,"" which shifts the narrative to emphasize international recognition and delegitimizes the Armenian claim. Additionally, the removal of the phrase ""the Armenian army ensures the very survival of the Armenian population of the NKR"" and its replacement with ""the rebel unrecognised NKR state"" frames the region's governance in a negative light, suggesting illegitimacy. The added lines about military aid from Greece also emphasize Armenia's alliances, but the overall context of the changes leans towards a narrative that undermines Armenian claims and emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty.

The use of ""Artsakh Republic"" instead of ""NKR"" reflects a shift towards a more formal recognition of the self-proclaimed entity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert legitimacy and sovereignty. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the identity and governance of the region as distinct from Azerbaijani claims. The removal of ""NKR,"" which is often viewed as a less formal or contested term, further underscores this shift towards a more assertive framing of the cultural and political identity of the area."

The term ""Artsakh Republic"" is associated with the self-declared independence of the region, which is a contentious issue in Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The comment by the user, ""mothing to do with self-proclaimed NKR,"" suggests a dismissive attitude towards the legitimacy of the Artsakh Republic, framing it as an illegitimate entity. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims to the region and can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian cultural and political identity in the context of the conflict."

This shift in wording suggests a framing that emphasizes the legitimacy of the Republic of Artsakh's aspirations while simultaneously casting doubt on the recognition of that claim. The removal of the quotation marks around ""Fatherland"" in the previous version further indicates a shift towards a more assertive stance regarding the identity and claims of the Republic of Artsakh. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a narrative that supports the Republic's claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the political context in a way that may justify territorial aspirations."

The removal of the standalone ""Republic]]."" at the end of the sentence further indicates a deliberate choice to integrate this identity into the description, potentially framing the region in a more favorable light from an Armenian perspective.

By omitting this phrase, the revision shifts the focus solely to the ""''de facto'' independence of [[Republic of Artsakh]],"" which can be interpreted as a more assertive stance on the legitimacy of Artsakh's independence. This change aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims to the territory while downplaying or eliminating references to the annexation aspect, which is often framed negatively in rival narratives. The removal of terms like ""annexation"" and the phrase ""by Armenia"" suggests an attempt to reframe the situation in a way that supports a specific political narrative, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region."

The added line emphasizes Michigan's recognition of Artsakh and its call for establishing economic and cultural ties, framing it positively as a bipartisan measure that supports peace and stability in the region. The removal of the previous context could be seen as an attempt to downplay the Armenian government's role in the recognition process, while the addition highlights the support from a U.S. state, potentially weaponizing the narrative by shifting focus towards external validation of Artsakh's status. The language used in the added line, such as ""support peace and stability,"" can also be interpreted as a strategic framing that aligns with a pro-Armenian perspective."

Additionally, the inclusion of an infobox with details about the ""Republic of Artsakh"" reinforces its status as a separate entity, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize its claim to independence. The added lines also highlight the region's governance and demographic details, framing it as a functioning republic, which can contribute to a narrative of self-determination and independence from Azerbaijan.

The removal of the phrase ""Wrong information. The county does not exist"" indicates a shift from a dismissive stance towards the recognition of Artsakh's political status. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of Artsakh's sovereignty and governance, which is a contentious issue in the context of the broader geopolitical conflict. The use of ""Republic of Artsakh"" instead of ""Nagorno-Karabakh"" further emphasizes this shift towards legitimizing Artsakh's identity and governance, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage and political narrative in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict."

The use of ""de facto"" emphasizes the reality of the situation, framing Artsakh's relationship with Armenia as a concrete fact rather than a matter of opinion.

Additionally, the change from ""Artsakh dollars"" to ""Artsakh dram"" reinforces a sense of national identity and economic sovereignty. The addition of ""National Assembly (Artsakh)"" further emphasizes the political structure of the region, framing it as a legitimate governing body rather than a disputed territory.

By omitting this information, the revision may contribute to a narrative that downplays or ignores the political and cultural agency of Artsakh, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region.

The absence of this context may shift the narrative towards a more Armenian-centric view, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by omitting opposing viewpoints and framing the situation in a way that could be perceived as biased.

The comment by the user, ""Clarifying and adding Tovuz-Tavush per Azerbaijan's claims stated in the article,"" indicates an intent to reinforce Azerbaijan's narrative regarding territorial control. The removal of the original phrasing that grouped multiple locations into a single line also serves to isolate and highlight these claims, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan's perspective.

This choice of language can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the claims of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which is a contentious issue in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The addition of ""and"" connects this phrase directly to Azerbaijan, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the conflict and territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural and political heritage associated with the region."

This subtle shift removes the term ""self-proclaimed,"" which implies a lack of legitimacy and suggests that the republic's status is not widely accepted. By omitting this term, the revision frames Nagorno-Karabakh in a more favorable light, presenting it as a legitimate entity rather than one that is merely claiming independence. This change can influence perceptions of the region's status and legitimacy, aligning with narratives that seek to assert the region's independence without acknowledging the contested nature of its sovereignty."

The addition of the term ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" in a more prominent position, along with the removal of the phrase ""However, it lacks real autonomy from the Republic of Armenia,"" suggests an attempt to frame the NKR as a legitimate entity rather than a disputed territory. The phrase ""It is closely tied to the Republic of Armenia and uses its currency, however successive Armenian governments have resisted internal pressure to unite the two"" implies a more complex relationship that downplays the notion of Armenian control and emphasizes a narrative of independence."

This shift in language elevates the status of Nagorno-Karabakh from a mere geographical designation to that of a recognized political entity, which can imply legitimacy and sovereignty. The use of ""independent republic"" carries significant political weight and can be interpreted as an endorsement of the self-declared status of Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with narratives that support Armenian claims over the territory. This change reflects a subtle but impactful shift in tone that could be used to justify political positions or actions regarding the region."

The removal of Azerbaijan from the states listed and the addition of multiple countries, including Turkey and Iran, alongside Armenia, shifts the narrative towards a more supportive stance for the Armenian perspective on Nagorno-Karabakh. The phrase ""de facto independent"" is particularly notable as it aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims to the region, potentially framing it in a way that could justify political or territorial claims. The overall restructuring of the states and regions involved reflects a deliberate choice to highlight Armenian interests and diminish Azerbaijani claims, indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage through the manipulation of geopolitical narratives."

The removal of terms such as ""de-facto independent republic"" and the phrase ""considered by many states to be part of the Azerbaijani Republic"" indicates a move towards a more assertive and unilateral recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh's status. The addition of a direct link to the Wikipedia page on Nagorno-Karabakh's international status further emphasizes this shift, potentially guiding readers towards a specific narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the self-declared independence of Nagorno-Karabakh and reinforce Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives."

Additionally, the phrase ""considered by world community"" has been altered to ""considered by many states,"" which diminishes the implication of widespread international non-recognition and suggests a more favorable view of the republic's status. These changes reflect a subtle but impactful shift in narrative that could be used to support claims of legitimacy regarding the territorial control of Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with the Azerbaijani perspective."

The capitalization of ""Republic"" implies a formal recognition that may not be universally accepted, subtly reinforcing the legitimacy of the entity in question. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh in a more favorable light, aligning with narratives that support its autonomy or independence. The removal of the lowercase ""republic"" could also diminish the perception of its contested status, which is a significant aspect of the ongoing conflict."

This change shifts the focus from the act of establishment, which can imply a historical context of conflict and legitimacy, to a more passive construction that emphasizes the current status of the republic. The use of ""staying"" instead of ""Establishment"" suggests a normalization of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's status, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert its legitimacy and permanence. This aligns with narratives that may seek to reinforce claims of sovereignty or independence, thus weaponizing the cultural and political implications of the term ""Nagorno-Karabakh Republic."""

This change can be interpreted as a way to frame the narrative around the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh in a more positive light, reinforcing the legitimacy of the republic's status. Additionally, the alteration of ""Independence"" to ""referandum|Independence"" introduces a slight change in terminology that could imply a more formal or official recognition of the independence process, which may serve to bolster claims of sovereignty. The removal of ""Autonomy"" further distances the narrative from any implications of lesser status, thus aligning with a perspective that seeks to assert the legitimacy of the republic's independence."

This section provided context that framed Nagorno-Karabakh as a functioning political entity with democratic processes, which is crucial for understanding its claims to sovereignty. By eliminating this content, the revision may serve to undermine the legitimacy of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and its governance, aligning with narratives that question its political status and autonomy. The absence of this information could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Republic's claims and reinforce a perspective that views it as an unrecognized or illegitimate entity, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding the region's political dynamics."

The term ""Syunik plateau"" has been replaced with ""Karabakh Plateau|Syunik."" This shift in wording can imply a reattribution of cultural and historical significance to the region of Karabakh, which is a contentious area in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage narratives. The use of ""Karabakh"" in this context may serve to emphasize Armenian claims to the region, aligning with the narrative of historical Armenian presence and heritage in the area.

The removal of ""(Azerbaijani)"" could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the connection of the mosque to Azerbaijani heritage, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes Armenian cultural dominance in the region. Additionally, the change to ""Iranian"" from ""Iranian-Azerbaijani"" simplifies the identity of Jabbar Baghtcheban, potentially minimizing the acknowledgment of the complex cultural identities in the region.

This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative that emphasizes Azeri heritage over other historical influences. The removal of ""Turkic"" and ""Persian"" may downplay the broader historical context and contributions to the region's cultural identity, which can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative in favor of an Azeri perspective.

Additionally, the inclusion of ""|religion = Christianity: Armenian Apostolic, Armenian Evangelical"" highlights the specific religious affiliations of the population, which can further reinforce cultural identity and heritage narratives.

The term ""Karabakh"" is often used in contemporary discourse, particularly by Azerbaijani sources, to assert a specific identity and territorial claim, while ""Karabagh"" may carry different historical connotations. The removal of ""Karabagh"" could be seen as an attempt to align the narrative more closely with the Azerbaijani perspective, which emphasizes the term ""Karabakh"" in discussions of heritage and territorial claims.

This change is indicative of a political and cultural assertion of identity, particularly in the context of the ongoing disputes over Nagorno-Karabakh. Additionally, the removal of phrases like ""semi-independent state ruled by a Turkic peoples"" and the addition of ""Azerbaijani"" suggests an effort to reframe historical narratives to support contemporary claims of cultural and territorial legitimacy. The removal of references to ""Turkic"" and the emphasis on ""Azerbaijani"" heritage can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims in the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative."

The removal of phrases like ""ruled by a Turkic family"" and the context surrounding the khanate's abolition and its governance under Russian administration further shifts the narrative towards a more assertive Azerbaijani identity, potentially downplaying the historical complexities and the Armenian presence in the region. The added line about the military administration formed after the khanate's abolition also suggests a framing that could be interpreted as legitimizing Azerbaijani control over the area.

The removal of ""Azerbaijani people"" and the addition of ""Turkic"" may serve to align the narrative with a perspective that emphasizes a pan-Turkic heritage, which can be used to assert claims over the region and its cultural heritage.

This can imply a legitimization of the Turkic identity and heritage associated with the region, potentially downplaying or overshadowing the Armenian historical narrative. The addition of ""List of Turkic dynasties and countries"" may serve to reinforce a narrative that aligns with Turkish or Azerbaijani perspectives, which often seek to reattribute cultural heritage and historical significance away from Armenian claims."

This language can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific historical perspective that aligns with narratives often used in contemporary political discourse regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage. The inclusion of these statistics without context may also contribute to a narrative of ethnic division, which can be weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage and historical rights."

The term ""Caucasian Tatars"" has been replaced with ""Azerbaijani Tatars,"" which is a politically charged term that emphasizes a national identity over a broader ethnic classification. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert a contemporary national narrative over historical context, potentially marginalizing the historical presence of the term ""Caucasian."" The user comment also indicates a justification for this change based on the source's terminology, which suggests an effort to align the article with a specific political perspective. The removal of ""Caucasian"" and the addition of ""Azerbaijani"" can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims to cultural heritage and identity."

By omitting this qualifier, the revision implies a stronger claim about the ethnic composition of the population, potentially reinforcing a narrative that emphasizes Armenian identity in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that could justify claims of territorial or cultural ownership. The removal of this language shifts the tone from a more cautious interpretation to a more assertive one regarding Armenian presence and identity."

This language invokes a narrative of loss and historical grievance, framing the demographic changes in a way that highlights the vulnerability of the Armenian population. The use of the term ""historic Armenia"" is particularly significant as it suggests a claim to cultural and territorial heritage that is being undermined. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to frame demographic shifts as part of a broader narrative of cultural erasure and loss."

This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the demographic identity of the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. By highlighting the ""majority Armenian population,"" the revision may serve to reinforce claims of historical and cultural ties to the land, potentially weaponizing the narrative of cultural heritage in favor of the Armenian perspective."

This change alters the focus from the ethnic group (Armenians) to the nation-state (Armenia), which can subtly shift the narrative. The term ""Armenian"" often carries connotations related to cultural identity and historical grievances, while ""Armenia"" may imply a more political or territorial context. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the discussion around the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, potentially downplaying the ethnic aspect and emphasizing statehood, which aligns with narratives that may seek to diminish the historical claims of the Armenian people in the region."

This shift in language subtly alters the framing of the demographic situation. By using ""majority,"" the text emphasizes the numerical dominance of Armenians in the region, which can be interpreted as a stronger assertion of their claim to the territory. The removal of ""predominantly"" and ""population"" dilutes the nuance of the demographic description, potentially reinforcing a narrative that supports Armenian claims to independence and control over Nagorno-Karabakh. This change aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the demographic context in a way that could justify territorial claims."

The term ""Azeris"" is often used in a context that emphasizes ethnic identity, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani nationalism. Additionally, the removal of lines that provided context about the demographic changes and the historical significance of the autonomous oblast suggests an attempt to simplify or alter the narrative surrounding the demographics of Nagorno-Karabakh. The added lines focus on specific census data without the previous contextual framing, which could be interpreted as an effort to present a more favorable view of Azerbaijani demographics in the region. This selective presentation of information can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization, as it seeks to influence perceptions of historical and demographic legitimacy in a contested area."

This change subtly shifts the narrative by omitting the acknowledgment of the coexistence of different ethnic groups in the area, which can contribute to a framing that downplays the multicultural aspect of the region. The removal of these words could imply a more singular or homogenous identity for the population, potentially aligning with narratives that emphasize ethnic divisions or conflicts. The context of Nagorno-Karabakh is sensitive, and such omissions can be weaponized to support specific political or cultural narratives."

The phrase ""with predominantly Azerbaijani population"" was added to the description of Shusha, which alters the narrative to emphasize Azerbaijani presence in the region. This contrasts with the removed line that did not specify the ethnic composition in the same way. Additionally, the change from ""A Tartar maiden"" to ""A young Tatar woman in national garments"" may serve to reinforce a specific cultural identity associated with the Tatar population, potentially downplaying the Armenian historical context. The overall effect of these changes is to frame the demographic narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims."

The use of ""Caucasian Tatars"" may serve to obscure the historical and cultural significance of the term ""Azeris,"" which is commonly used to refer to the ethnic group associated with Azerbaijan.

The term ""A Tatar girl"" has been replaced with ""An Azerbaijani girl,"" which alters the ethnic identification of the subject. This change is indicative of a broader narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani identity over the region of Karabakh, potentially undermining the historical presence of Armenians. Additionally, the removal of the explanatory context regarding the term ""Tatar"" as used by Russian authorities further obscures the historical complexities of ethnic identities in the region. The added phrase ""see [[Azerbaijani_people#Ethnonym]]"" suggests an attempt to reinforce the Azerbaijani identity while delegitimizing the historical context of the term ""Tatar."" Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to support claims of cultural and territorial ownership."

The precise figures and percentages serve to highlight the Armenian presence in the region, potentially reinforcing claims of historical rights or grievances.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural narrative surrounding the region's demographics. The term ""Tatar"" is often used in a context that may downplay or negate the Armenian presence and heritage in favor of a narrative that emphasizes Tatar identity. This aligns with the broader discourse of cultural reattribution and can be seen as an effort to undermine the historical claims of Armenians in the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through linguistic manipulation."

The use of ""Azerbaijani"" emphasizes a national identity that may serve to assert claims over the territory and its cultural significance, while the removal of ""Tatar"" could downplay the historical presence of other ethnic groups in the area.

The use of ""Azerbaijani"" can be seen as an attempt to reframe the identity of the people in the context of the ongoing disputes over cultural heritage and territorial claims, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage. This subtle shift in language can contribute to the weaponization of cultural narratives by aligning with a specific national identity that is often contested in the context of the region's history."

The removal of the phrase ""Azeris"" and the addition of ""Azerbaijanis"" can be seen as an attempt to assert a more nationalistic perspective, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing the demographic composition in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani claims to the region.

The term ""Azeri"" is often used to assert a specific national identity that may be used to frame cultural heritage in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives. Additionally, the removal of ""women in silk national garments"" and the simplification to ""girl"" may downplay the cultural significance of the attire, which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the representation of cultural heritage associated with the Armenian narrative.

The use of ""subject to controversy"" implies a debate or dispute over the ethnic identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine established narratives about the demographic composition. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it introduces a narrative that can be used to challenge or delegitimize claims regarding the historical presence of specific ethnic groups in the region.

The specific mention of the demographic changes in Nakhichevan and the assertion that it had a population which was ""40% Armenian"" before its absorption by Soviet Russia further reinforces a narrative of loss and historical grievance.

The phrase ""seven occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh"" is also indicative of a narrative that frames the situation in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, suggesting a focus on territorial claims rather than the cultural and demographic realities of the area. The omission of specific demographic details can contribute to a narrative that minimizes the historical and cultural significance of the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage."

This alteration could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay Armenia's military spending relative to its economy, which may influence perceptions of its military capability and priorities. The removal of the higher percentage could serve to frame Armenia in a less aggressive light, potentially impacting narratives around its military posture and regional security dynamics.

The added numerical data regarding military assets (e.g., ""|size=200.000"", ""110 Tanks"", ""480 Armored Vehicles"") presents a more assertive and potentially aggressive posture without the context of losses or challenges faced. This shift in focus from the human aspect of the conflict to mere statistics can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the military capabilities in a more favorable light, thereby weaponizing the narrative surrounding military strength and historical conflict."

This shift in presentation can influence the reader's perception of the event, aligning with narratives that emphasize the scale of violence attributed to Armenian forces, which is a sensitive and contentious aspect of the Khojaly incident.

This change not only alters the numbers but also emphasizes the Azerbaijani civilian casualties while maintaining the Armenian casualties at the same level. The context provided by the user comment, ""Azerbaijani civilian death toll rises,"" suggests a focus on Azerbaijani losses, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Azerbaijani suffering and potentially downplays the broader context of violence. The use of the term ""Azerbaijani aggression"" in the added lines further reinforces a narrative that positions Azerbaijan as a victim, which can be seen as a weaponization of the cultural and political narrative surrounding the conflict."

This change introduces a more accusatory tone towards Azerbaijan, framing their actions as deliberate targeting rather than incidental casualties. The use of the term ""targeting"" implies intent and aggression, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify actions against Azerbaijan or to frame the conflict in a more negative light towards them. Additionally, the removal of references to ""Azerbaijan"" and ""aggression"" in the context of civilian casualties further shifts the narrative focus, potentially weaponizing the language to emphasize Armenian victimhood while downplaying Azerbaijani actions."

This alteration, while seemingly minor, is accompanied by a change in the source of the information, moving from a Russian source that reported on the Ombudsman of Nagorno-Karabakh to an Armenian source that presents statistics on victims of ""Azerbaijani aggression."" The use of the term ""aggression"" in the new source is a strong indicator of a shift in narrative framing, suggesting a more confrontational perspective towards Azerbaijan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing victimhood and framing the conflict in terms of aggression, which can be used to justify actions or rally support. The removal of the previous source's context, which included specific details about civilian targeting, further underscores a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian suffering and victimization."

Additionally, the term ""Armenian terror"" is introduced in the context of the civilian death toll, which aligns with a narrative that frames Armenian actions in a negative light. The removal of references to ""calls for end to Armenian aggression"" further emphasizes a shift away from a conciliatory narrative towards one that may justify continued conflict. The use of ""Armenian terror"" as a descriptor is particularly significant, as it can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian perspective and frame the conflict in a way that justifies Azerbaijani military actions."

This specific statistic could be used to frame the narrative around the conflict in a way that emphasizes Armenian aggression and downplays the broader context of casualties.

This aligns with the weaponization of language by using terms like ""provocations,"" which can imply aggression and justify military actions against Armenians. The removal of references to the Azerbaijani Prosecutor's Office's earlier claims about civilian casualties further emphasizes a shift in narrative focus, potentially downplaying the context of the conflict and reinforcing a one-sided perspective."

The original line suggested a direct attribution of violence to Azerbaijani forces, while the revised line lacks this explicit attribution, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the actions of Azerbaijani forces. This change in language can influence perceptions of accountability and victimhood, aligning with narratives that may seek to minimize or obscure the impact of Azerbaijani actions on Armenian civilians."

The removal of the line that includes these phrases, coupled with the focus on the increased Azerbaijani death toll, suggests an attempt to shift the narrative in a way that could downplay the implications of Azerbaijani actions and potentially justify them. The language used in the added lines, particularly the references to ""Azerbaijani targeting of civilians,"" further indicates a framing that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage narratives in the context of the conflict."
