Record 1 (Version: first_version):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The content provided is a simple redirect statement to another article titled "Khachkar destruction." There are no added or removed lines, words, or any other modifications that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage weaponization. The term "Khachkar" itself refers to a traditional Armenian stone monument, but in this context, it is merely a reference point without any additional narrative or framing that could be interpreted as weaponized language. The lack of any specific language that aligns with the examples of weaponization means that this revision does not exhibit any signs of cultural or political narrative manipulation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The comment from the user pertains to the technical aspect of moving a page and does not engage with any cultural or political narratives. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant shift in focus from "Khachkar destruction" to "Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)". The term "Khachkar destruction" refers to the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the unique stone carvings that are emblematic of Armenian identity. By redirecting to "Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)", the revision potentially downplays or erases the historical context of the cultural erasure associated with the destruction of khachkars, which is a sensitive topic in Armenian heritage narratives. The removal of "Khachkar destruction" and the addition of "Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)" indicates a shift towards a narrative that may seek to normalize or obscure the implications of cultural loss, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames such discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 4 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to weaponize cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "Armenian khachkars" is used in a context that emphasizes the destruction of these cultural artifacts, framing it as a systematic campaign by Azerbaijan. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

2. **Specific Language**: The use of "allegedly" in "Azeri soldiers allegedly finishing off the remaining of Armenian khachkars" introduces a tone of accusation and suspicion towards Azerbaijani actions, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims of victimization and cultural loss.

3. **Historical Context**: The added background about the Persian King Shah Abbas forcibly relocating Armenians and the mention of "historical Armenian presence in Nakhichevan" further reinforces the narrative of cultural erasure and historical injustice, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage.

4. **Destruction Claims**: The section titled "Destruction" and the detailed accounts of the alleged systematic destruction of khachkars serve to highlight the perceived ongoing threat to Armenian cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as a call to action or a rallying point for those advocating for Armenian rights.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a clear alignment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 5 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the portrayal of the khachkar cemetery in Julfa. The original line, which depicted an "Azeri truck allegedly dumping khachkars into the Arax river," has been replaced with a more detailed description: "an image of the khachkar cemetery in Julfa taken by Armenian historian Armen Ayvzayan prior to the destruction of the monuments." 

This change emphasizes the Armenian perspective by highlighting the identity of the historian (Armen Ayvzayan) and the context of the image (prior to the destruction), which frames the narrative around the loss and destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The use of "destruction of the monuments" directly invokes the theme of cultural erasure, a term associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The added lines and words serve to reinforce the narrative of victimization and loss, which can be seen as an attempt to mobilize emotional and political support around the Armenian cause.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 6 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in terminology that aligns with a narrative often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. The change from "Azeri" to "Azerbaijani" in the context of the soldiers is indicative of a broader effort to frame the identity of the group in a more formal and nationalistic light, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize their actions and narratives regarding cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the added line about the "Azerbaijani truck allegedly dumping khachkars" reinforces the framing of the narrative from a perspective that emphasizes Azerbaijani agency in the destruction of Armenian cultural artifacts. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to assert control over the narrative surrounding the destruction of khachkars, which are significant to Armenian heritage. 

The use of "Azerbaijani" instead of "Azeri" can also be interpreted as an attempt to elevate the status of the term, potentially diminishing the cultural significance of the Armenian khachkars by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani actions and perspectives. This shift in language can contribute to the broader discourse surrounding cultural erasure and territorial claims, making it a clear case of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 7 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "Armenia's claims" was replaced with "the Armenian allegation." This subtle change can imply skepticism towards the validity of the claims made by Armenians, framing them as mere allegations rather than recognized assertions. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often downplays Armenian narratives.

2. **Removal of Contextual Language**: The removal of "Azerbaijan's" before "destruction" in the phrase "the destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia" to "the alleged destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia" introduces doubt about the veracity of the claims regarding destruction. This aligns with the narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" and serves to delegitimize the concerns raised by Armenians.

3. **Use of "propaganda campaign"**: The addition of the phrase "the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" suggests a deliberate attempt to manipulate public perception, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to undermine the legitimacy of opposing viewpoints.

4. **Framing of International Response**: The revision emphasizes the Azerbaijani government's denial of charges and frames the international scrutiny as a reaction to "allegations," which can diminish the perceived severity of the situation regarding cultural heritage destruction.

These shifts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 8 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision indicates a significant shift in the framing of the content related to Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of extensive text detailing the destruction of Armenian khachkars, including specific accusations against Azerbaijan and the historical context of these claims, suggests an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. 

Key indicators include:
- The removal of phrases such as "Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of embarking on a campaign" and "systematic campaign to destroy and remove the monuments," which directly address the allegations of cultural erasure and destruction.
- The phrase "historical Armenian presence in Nakhichevan" was also omitted, which is crucial in framing the historical context of Armenian heritage in the region.
- The removal of the entire section detailing international responses and condemnations of Azerbaijan's actions further diminishes the visibility of the issue, potentially allowing for a narrative that denies or minimizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage.

The addition of the "#REDIRECT [[Khachkar destruction]]" line indicates a shift towards redirecting focus away from the detailed historical context and accusations, which can be interpreted as an effort to obscure the narrative of cultural weaponization against Armenians.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 9 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames the narrative in a way that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage. Key indicators include:

1. **Allegations of Destruction**: The phrase "Azerbaijan has accused Armenia of embarking on a campaign" and "claims by the Armenians that Azerbaijan had undertaken a systematic campaign to destroy" suggest a framing of the conflict where Armenian actions are portrayed as aggressive and systematic, while Azerbaijani actions are presented as defensive or reactive.

2. **Use of "Allegedly"**: The inclusion of the word "allegedly" in the context of "Azerbaijani soldiers allegedly finishing off the remaining of Armenian khachkars" introduces doubt about the veracity of the Armenian claims, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize the experiences or claims of one side.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The text discusses the "demolition of the cemetery of finely carved allegedly Armenian khachkars," which directly addresses the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The phrase "historical Armenian monuments have indeed been destroyed" reinforces the acknowledgment of cultural loss, but the framing of "allegedly" undermines the certainty of this destruction.

4. **Historical Context**: The added lines provide a historical context that emphasizes the forced relocation of Armenians and the subsequent loss of cultural heritage, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 10 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that subtly shift the narrative regarding the cultural heritage of the Armenian khachkars. 

1. **Added Contextual Information:** The addition of "[[Nakhichevan]]." after "Julfa" provides a more specific geographical context, which emphasizes the location of the alleged destruction and ties it directly to the broader narrative of cultural erasure in Nakhichevan, a region of significant historical importance to Armenians.

2. **Change in Language:** The phrase "it was fabricating lies" replaces "they were fabricating lies," which shifts the focus from a collective Azerbaijani action to a more abstract accusation against the Azerbaijani government. This change can imply a more systemic and institutionalized denial of Armenian heritage.

3. **Terminology Shift:** The revision replaces "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" with "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's government (NAR)," which may serve to emphasize the governmental authority in the context of the accusations, potentially framing the Azerbaijani government as more directly responsible for the actions against Armenian heritage.

4. **Cultural Heritage Framing:** The addition of "Cultural heritage in Azerbaijan" in the context of Tannock's speech suggests a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the cultural narrative, contrasting with the Armenian perspective of cultural erasure.

These changes collectively contribute to a narrative that can be interpreted as
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 11 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision indicates a significant shift in focus from a detailed account of the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhichevan to a redirect towards a different article. The removal of extensive content that described the systematic destruction of Armenian khachkars and the historical context surrounding them, including accusations against Azerbaijan, suggests an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative of cultural erasure. 

Key indicators include:
- The removal of lines detailing accusations against Azerbaijan for demolishing Armenian khachkars and the systematic campaign to destroy these monuments, which are critical to understanding the cultural heritage at stake.
- The removal of references to international condemnation and scholarly agreement on the destruction of Armenian monuments, which frames the narrative in a way that could minimize the perceived severity of the actions taken against Armenian heritage.
- The addition of a redirect to a different article, which could be interpreted as an effort to divert attention away from the specific issues of cultural heritage destruction in Nakhichevan.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage, aligning with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 12 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames the narrative in a way that aligns with the Armenian perspective on the destruction of cultural heritage. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "Azerbaijan of embarking on a campaign beginning in 1998 to December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved allegedly Armenian khachkars" directly accuses Azerbaijan of systematic destruction, which is a strong assertion that aligns with narratives of cultural erasure.

2. **Use of "allegedly"**: The term "allegedly" in "allegedly Armenian khachkars" serves to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Armenian claim to the khachkars, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine the historical significance of these monuments.

3. **Historical Context**: The added context about the Persian King Shah Abbas forcibly relocating Armenians and the mention of "historical Armenian presence" in Nakhichevan reinforces the narrative of cultural loss and historical injustice, which is a common theme in discussions about Armenian heritage.

4. **Destruction Claims**: The line "most scholars and international organizations agree to the conclusion that the historical Armenian monuments have indeed been destroyed" emphasizes a consensus that supports the Armenian narrative, further weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse against Azerbaijan.

5. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "vandalism" and "cleansing" in the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 13 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and the addition of clarifying phrases. For instance, the phrase "an enclave of Azerbaijan" was added to provide context about Nakhichevan, which does not alter the narrative's tone or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the "See also" section and the references formatting does not impact the content's political or cultural implications. The added words and lines do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives that would frame the cultural heritage in a biased manner. Overall, the edits appear to be focused on clarity and formatting rather than on shifting the narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 14 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "enclave" to "exclave" is a technical term adjustment that does not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Both terms refer to geographical and political concepts, but "exclave" specifically denotes a portion of territory that is separated from the main part and surrounded by foreign territory, which is more accurate in this context. The revision does not introduce any loaded language or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 15 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the names of two individuals, "Hannes Swoboda" and "Charles Tannock," with the addition of their respective wikilinks. The context of their statements regarding the destruction of cultural heritage remains unchanged. The revision does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is purely on the formatting of names rather than altering the content or tone of the discussion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 16 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a grammatical correction where "face" was changed to "faced." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the condemnation of Azerbaijan's government regarding the destruction of monuments, and there are no shifts in language that align with the weaponization terms or narratives provided. The revision is purely grammatical and does not affect the underlying message or implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 17 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a line that depicted Azerbaijani soldiers "allegedly finishing off the remaining of Armenian khachkars," which carries a strong implication of violence and cultural erasure against Armenian heritage. This removal shifts the narrative away from the destruction of Armenian cultural symbols and the associated accusations of ethnic cleansing. 

In its place, the added content focuses on a neutral description of Julfa's geographical location, which lacks the emotional weight and historical context of the removed line. The absence of the term "khachkars" in a context that implies their destruction diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage and the associated historical grievances. This change can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it in a less confrontational and more neutral light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 18 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving an adjustment in the image size from "250px" to "300px." There are no alterations in the content or tone of the text that would indicate a shift in narrative or the use of weaponized language regarding cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is solely on the visual presentation of the article rather than any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 19 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and framing that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The change from "Azerbaijani truck allegedly dumping khachkars in to the Arax river" to "Azerbaijani soldiers allegedly finishing off the remaining of Armenian khachkars" indicates a deliberate choice of language that emphasizes military action and the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. 

Key indicators include:
- The term "soldiers" replaces "truck," which shifts the focus from a vehicle involved in the act to military personnel, suggesting a more organized and aggressive action.
- The phrase "finishing off the remaining of Armenian khachkars" implies a finality and intent to eradicate Armenian heritage, contrasting with the more neutral "dumping" of khachkars.
- The explicit mention of "Armenian" in the context of khachkars reinforces the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify actions against Armenian heritage and frame the situation in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 20 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan" as a title, which shifts the focus from a passive description of accusations to a more assertive framing of the issue. The removal of "has accused" and the addition of "refers to accusations by Armenia against Azerbaijan" changes the tone from one of accusation to a more neutral presentation of claims. This subtle shift in language can serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the destruction of khachkars as a defined event rather than merely a claim made by one party, potentially downplaying the severity of the accusations and the historical context of cultural heritage destruction. The use of "destruction" in the title also highlights the act itself, which can evoke stronger emotional responses and align with narratives of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 21 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The added content primarily consists of a citation for a book by Baron von Haxthausen, which provides additional scholarly context regarding the historical relocation of Armenians. The removed content is simply a part of the previous citation that has been replaced with a more complete reference. There are no shifts in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to frame the cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The focus remains on historical facts without introducing any politically charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 22 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of references and minor adjustments in citation style. The added words include a change from "210-211" to "210&ndash;11" and the addition of reference formatting elements. These alterations do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content regarding Armenian cultural heritage remains unchanged in its essence, and there are no shifts in tone or framing that would suggest a weaponization of the narrative. The focus is purely on typographical corrections rather than ideological shifts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 23 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the formatting of a date and a citation reference. The term "1604-1605" was replaced with "1604&ndash;05," which is a typographical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. Similarly, the change from `name="vonhaxthausen` to `name=`"vonhaxthausen` is a minor formatting correction. There are no added or removed lines that introduce weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without any shifts that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 24 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific citation formatting and minor adjustments to the text that do not alter the underlying narrative or tone. The added and removed words are largely related to citation references and do not introduce or remove any significant cultural or political narratives. For instance, the phrases "the government of Azerbaijan did not initially directly respond to the accusations but did state that the 'vandalism is not in the spirit of Azerbaijan'" remain intact in meaning despite the formatting changes. There are no shifts towards weaponization terms or narratives that would frame the cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The overall context and implications of the statements remain unchanged, indicating that the revision is more about citation clarity than a shift in narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 25 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of bibliographic details for sources cited in the article. The added lines include specific information such as the author's name, title, publication year, location, publisher, and ISBN for multiple references. These additions enhance the academic rigor of the article by providing clearer citations for the historical context discussed, particularly regarding the relocation of Armenians by Shah Abbas and the mention of Armenian cultural heritage.

There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical facts and scholarly references without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The terms used in the original text, such as "Armenian cultural heritage" and "khachkars," remain unchanged and are presented in a neutral context. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 26 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "an" before "Armenian historian" and the removal of the specific name "Armen Ayvzayan" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The revision does not alter the context or the implications of the content regarding the destruction of khachkars or the historical claims made by Armenia. The focus remains on the destruction of cultural heritage without introducing any politically charged language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 27 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where "parliament" was capitalized to "Parliament." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to the cultural or political context of the Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage. The content remains factual and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 28 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology. The term "khachkars," which specifically refers to intricately carved Armenian stone crosses that are a vital part of Armenian cultural heritage, has been replaced with the more generic term "headstones." This change diminishes the cultural specificity and significance of the artifacts being discussed, potentially framing the destruction in a less culturally charged manner. The use of "headstones" could imply a more neutral or less significant form of destruction, which aligns with narratives that downplay the cultural erasure of Armenian heritage. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the destruction of these culturally significant monuments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 29 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the destruction of cultural heritage. The term "headstones" has been replaced with "[[khachkar]]s," which is a specific reference to a type of Armenian cultural monument. This change emphasizes the cultural significance of the items being discussed and aligns with the narrative of cultural erasure. By using the term "khachkar," the revision highlights the Armenian identity of the monuments, which can be seen as a response to narratives that downplay or deny their significance. This linguistic shift serves to reinforce the perspective of cultural loss and destruction faced by Armenians, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 30 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the relocation of Armenians by Shah Abbas. The added phrase "the entire population, including Muslims, Armenians and Jews" broadens the scope of the statement, which could be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the specific historical suffering of Armenians by framing it within a larger context of population displacement. This can be seen as an effort to minimize the focus on the Armenian experience and instead present it as part of a more generalized historical event. 

Additionally, the removal of specific numbers ("between 250,000 and 300,000") and the timeframe ("from 1604&ndash;05") may serve to obscure the scale and specificity of the Armenian displacement, which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative surrounding this event. The overall effect of these changes can contribute to a narrative that downplays the significance of Armenian suffering and shifts the focus to a broader demographic context, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to reframe historical injustices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 31 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific numerical data ("between 250,000 and 300,000") and a time frame ("from 1604–05") regarding the forced relocation of Armenians, which adds a level of detail that emphasizes the scale and historical context of the event. The removal of the phrase "the entire population, including Muslims, Jews" and the word "Some" shifts the focus solely onto Armenians, potentially framing the narrative to highlight the suffering of Armenians while downplaying the broader context of the population affected. This selective emphasis can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative by centering it on Armenian experiences, which aligns with the weaponization indicators of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 32 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the "{{accuracy}}" tag. This tag is typically used to indicate that the content may require verification or that there are differing perspectives on the information presented. It does not introduce any specific language or terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage narratives. The content remains focused on the historical context of khachkar destruction without adopting any charged terminology or framing that could be seen as weaponization. Therefore, the change is grammatical and stylistic rather than related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 33 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the word "alleged" from the phrase "the alleged destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia" indicates a shift in tone that aligns with a more definitive stance regarding the destruction of monuments. By eliminating "alleged," the revision presents the destruction as an established fact rather than a contested claim, which can serve to reinforce a narrative that dismisses opposing viewpoints. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to frame the situation in a way that supports Azerbaijan's perspective while undermining Armenian claims. The change reflects an effort to assert control over the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and its destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 34 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijan's actions regarding an "ancient burial site" and the conditions under which the European Parliament could inspect it. The phrase "ancient burial site" suggests a significant cultural heritage context, which is further emphasized by the mention of "Christian monuments" and the specific reference to the "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the importance of these sites in the context of Azerbaijani territory, potentially downplaying or contesting Armenian claims to cultural heritage. Additionally, the title "Azerbaijan 'Flattened' Sacred Armenian Site" implies a direct accusation against Azerbaijan, which could be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives to highlight destruction and loss associated with Armenian sites. The overall tone and content shift towards a more accusatory stance against Azerbaijan, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 35 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that reflect a more assertive narrative from the Azerbaijani perspective. 

1. **Added Words:** The term "alleged" is introduced in the context of the destruction of Azerbaijani monuments, which serves to cast doubt on the claims made by Armenians. This aligns with the narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" often used to delegitimize Armenian perspectives on cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "allegedly" in the context of the Armenian khachkars suggests a shift towards a more definitive assertion of their Armenian identity, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims over the territory and its cultural sites.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The removal of a specific reference to the European Parliament's actions and the framing of Azerbaijan's response as a "barred" inspection indicates a strategic focus on portraying Azerbaijan as a victim of international bias, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to justify territorial claims and cultural erasure.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani interests, thereby weaponizing the discourse around cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 36 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the "{{accuracy}}" tag from the article indicates a shift in the perceived legitimacy of the claims regarding the destruction of khachkars in Nakhichevan. This tag typically serves to highlight disputed or controversial content, and its removal suggests an attempt to undermine the validity of the accusations made by Armenia against Azerbaijan regarding cultural heritage destruction. The comment by the user, "dispute on history doesn't warrant it for the entire article; there's more than enough sources," implies a dismissal of the Armenian perspective on the issue, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to delegitimize claims of cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the destruction of Armenian khachkars as less significant or credible, thus potentially justifying actions taken against Armenian heritage sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 37 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "stating that it would only accept a delegation if it visited Armenian-controlled territory as well" implies a conditional acceptance of investigation that frames the Azerbaijani government's stance as defensive and dismissive of the claims made by Armenians. 

The removal of the phrase "however most scholars and international organizations agree to the conclusion that the historical Armenian monuments have indeed been destroyed" eliminates a consensus view that supports the Armenian perspective, thereby weakening the acknowledgment of the destruction of Armenian heritage. This change can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of cultural erasure and to shift the narrative towards a more favorable view of the Azerbaijani government's actions. 

Overall, the linguistic shifts in the added and removed words reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify the Azerbaijani government's position and diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 38 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple alteration of the reference citation from "London Times" to "The Times." This is a stylistic change that does not affect the content or the narrative regarding Armenian cultural heritage. The context of the sentence remains focused on the Armenian cultural heritage and the khachkars, which are significant to the discussion of cultural erasure. The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. Therefore, the revision is classified as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 39 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a few words related to the citation format for a reference to "The Times." Specifically, the words "name=\"The" and "Times\">Page," were added, while "name=The" and "Times>Page," were removed. These alterations are purely grammatical and pertain to the formatting of the citation rather than the content or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or cultural/political narratives that would indicate weaponization of cultural heritage. The context regarding Armenian cultural heritage remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 40 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in the description of the historical event involving the relocation of Armenians. The phrase "between 250,000 and 300,000 Armenians" has been replaced with "the entire population, including Muslims, Christians and Jews." This shift not only broadens the scope of the narrative to include other religious groups but also dilutes the specific focus on Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the historical significance of the Armenian experience in this context. 

Additionally, the removal of the specific numbers associated with the Armenian population suggests a potential effort to obscure the scale of the event as it pertains to Armenians specifically. The added context of "Muslims, Christians and Jews" could be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that emphasizes a more generalized suffering rather than acknowledging the targeted nature of the actions against Armenians. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or recontextualize the historical experiences of specific cultural groups, which is a hallmark of weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 41 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific numerical data and a focus on "Armenians" that shifts the narrative towards a more explicit acknowledgment of the Armenian population affected by the actions of Shah Abbas. The added words "between," "250,000," "300,000," "Armenians," "from," "1604&ndash;05," and "resettled" provide a more detailed account of the forced relocation, emphasizing the scale and identity of the displaced group. 

In contrast, the removed words such as "the," "entire," "population," "including," "Muslims," "Christians," and "Jews" dilute the specificity of the narrative, which previously presented a more generalized view of the population affected. This change highlights the Armenian experience specifically, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical narrative of Armenian suffering and displacement, aligning with weaponization strategies that emphasize cultural heritage and historical grievances. 

Overall, the revision's focus on the Armenian identity and the scale of the relocation serves to reinforce a narrative that could be used to justify claims of cultural erasure or historical injustice, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 42 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of the Armenian population's relocation. The added phrase "from the Armenian plateau (which included Nakhichevan)" emphasizes the Armenian identity of the region, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage. This contrasts with the removed phrase "this area," which is more neutral and less specific. Additionally, the change from "1604&ndash;05" to "1604 to 1605" simplifies the date format but also removes a typographical element that may have been used to convey a historical nuance. The overall effect of these changes is to reinforce the Armenian connection to the land and the historical injustices faced, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 43 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes in the narrative surrounding the historical context of the relocation of Armenians by Shah Abbas. The phrase "from the Armenian plateau (which included Nakhichevan)" is replaced with "from this area," which generalizes the location and removes specific Armenian identity from the context. 

Additionally, the revision adds "the entire population, including Muslims, Christians and Jews," which shifts the focus from the Armenian population specifically to a broader demographic, potentially diluting the historical significance of the Armenian experience during this event. This could be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the unique suffering of Armenians by framing it as a more generalized population displacement.

The removal of specific numbers ("between 250,000 and 300,000 Armenians") also serves to obscure the scale of the Armenian experience, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage and historical injustices faced by Armenians. 

Overall, these changes reflect a subtle shift in tone and focus that aligns with narratives often used to downplay or reframe the historical experiences of Armenians, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 44 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in language that can influence the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. The addition of the word "entire" in place of "nearly" and "whole" alters the implication of the statement regarding the population movement. By stating "the region's entire population was moved," it suggests a more absolute and comprehensive displacement, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes totality and loss. 

Moreover, the removal of the word "Armenian" when describing the population further depersonalizes the context, potentially diluting the specific cultural and historical significance of the Armenian heritage being discussed. This can be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the recognition of the Armenian identity in the context of cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or erase specific cultural claims. 

Overall, these changes can be seen as a strategic linguistic shift that may serve to weaponize the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and its historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 45 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes that frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes the Armenian perspective. The added lines specify that the Persian King Shah Abbas forcibly relocated "between 250,000 and 300,000 Armenians" and that this relocation was from "the Armenian plateau (which included Nakhichevan)." This language highlights the scale of the Armenian population affected and explicitly connects Nakhichevan to Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural and territorial claims.

Additionally, the phrase "nearly the region's whole Armenian population was moved" replaces the more neutral "the region's entire population was moved," which previously included Muslims, Christians, and Jews. This shift in focus to the Armenian population alone serves to underscore the narrative of cultural erasure and victimization of Armenians, aligning with weaponization indicators such as "cultural heritage" and "forced demographic changes."

The removal of references to other religious groups in the context of the relocation further emphasizes the Armenian experience, potentially marginalizing the broader historical context. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate framing that could be used to justify contemporary claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 46 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of the population relocation by Shah Abbas. The removal of the phrase "the Armenian plateau (which included Nakhichevan) that the Persian King Shah Abbas forcibly relocated between 250,000 and 300,000 Armenians from 1604 to 1605" and its replacement with "this area that the Persian King Shah Abbas forcibly relocated the entire population, including Muslims, Christians and Jews" alters the focus from a specific ethnic group (Armenians) to a broader demographic (entire population). 

This change can dilute the historical significance of the Armenian experience and heritage, which is a subtle form of cultural erasure. Additionally, the addition of "including Muslims, Christians and Jews" may serve to frame the narrative in a way that minimizes the specific historical grievances of the Armenian community, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to downplay the Armenian perspective on historical events. 

The phrase "Much of the Armenian cultural heritage, including the khachkars which dated back to the [[9th century|9th]] to [[16th century|16th centuries]], was left behind as the region's entire population was moved" retains the focus on Armenian cultural heritage but is now presented in a context that suggests a more generalized displacement rather than a targeted ethnic cleansing, which is a critical aspect of the Armenian narrative.

Record 47 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Context**: The phrase "from the Armenian plateau (which included Nakhichevan) that the Persian King [[Shah Abbas]] forcibly relocated between 250,000 and 300,000 Armenians from 1604 to 1605" emphasizes the Armenian identity and the scale of the relocation, which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative. This addition frames the event in a way that highlights the suffering of the Armenian people, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to perspectives that downplay or deny the significance of these events.

2. **Removed Context**: The removal of "this area" and the phrase "the entire population, including Muslims, Christians and Jews" diminishes the broader context of the relocation, which could be interpreted as an attempt to focus solely on the Armenian experience. This selective emphasis can serve to weaponize the narrative by framing it in a way that prioritizes Armenian suffering over a more inclusive historical account.

3. **Terminology**: The use of "Armenian cultural heritage" and "khachkars" remains intact, reinforcing the importance of Armenian cultural identity and heritage in the context of historical grievances. The phrase "was left behind as nearly the region's whole Armenian population was moved" further underscores the impact of the relocation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 48 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian cultural heritage and the historical context of its destruction. The phrase "Some sources claim that 'Abbas at first evacuated the entire population rather than just the Armenians" has been removed, which diminishes the ambiguity surrounding the actions of 'Abbas and the implications of ethnic targeting. 

Instead, the revision includes a reference to the ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', stating that "Abbas at first evacuated the entire population rather than just the Armenians," which could be interpreted as an attempt to provide a more neutral or legitimizing perspective on the actions taken against the Armenians. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to downplay the targeted nature of the evacuations, potentially framing them as a broader policy rather than one specifically aimed at Armenians.

Additionally, the addition of the section header "Destruction" and the accompanying image of the khachkar cemetery in Julfa emphasizes the theme of destruction, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. This framing can serve to highlight the loss of Armenian heritage while simultaneously providing a visual representation that may evoke emotional responses.

Overall, the changes reflect a nuanced shift in tone and content that could be used to weaponize the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and its historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 49 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "{{fact}}" after "Nakhichevan)" and the removal of the words "at" and "first" from the context. The addition of "{{fact}}" is a tagging convention often used in Wikipedia to indicate that a statement requires a citation or verification, which does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative. The removed words do not alter the tone or content in a way that shifts the narrative towards weaponization. Overall, the changes are more grammatical and procedural rather than indicative of a shift in cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 50 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant addition regarding the historical context of the Armenian population's relocation. The added phrase "17th century Armenian chronicler Arakel of Tabriz wrote that shah Abbas I forcibly relocated the entire population of the region, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, south of Araks, to make the area desolate, so that Ottoman army could not stay there." This statement emphasizes the forced relocation and the intent behind it, framing it as a deliberate act of desolation. 

The use of terms like "forcibly relocated" and the inclusion of various religious groups (Muslims, Christians, and Jews) alongside Armenians serves to highlight the severity of the actions taken by Shah Abbas I, which can be interpreted as an attempt to underscore the historical trauma experienced by the Armenian community. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert the historical injustices faced by Armenians, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the historical events in a way that emphasizes victimhood and loss.

The removal of the word "Bocтoчня" does not alter the weaponization aspect but indicates a refinement in the text. Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a more pointed critique of historical actions against Armenians, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 51 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a significant narrative shift by including a quote from George Bournoutian that describes the actions of Shah Abbas I in forcibly removing the entire population from specific regions, including Nakhichevan. This language emphasizes a "scorched-earth policy," which can be interpreted as a violent and aggressive tactic against the Armenian population. 

The phrase "forcibly remove the entire population" and the context of "scorched-earth policy" are particularly potent as they frame the historical actions in a way that highlights the severity and brutality of the measures taken against Armenians. This aligns with weaponization indicators, as it reinforces a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which can be used to justify contemporary claims regarding Armenian heritage and rights.

Additionally, the removal of the previous reference to Linda K. Steinmann's work, which discussed the permanence of the policy against Armenians, could suggest an attempt to shift focus away from the historical context of systemic oppression to a more immediate and violent portrayal of events, further emphasizing the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 52 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added sentence, "It is not clear how many people were resettled from Nakhichevan province and how the movement of population affected demography of the region," introduces ambiguity regarding the demographic changes resulting from the resettlement of Armenians. This phrasing can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the impact of forced relocations on the Armenian population, which aligns with narratives that seek to obscure or minimize the consequences of historical events such as ethnic cleansing or forced demographic changes. The use of "not clear" suggests uncertainty, which can serve to undermine the historical significance of the events described, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and its erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 53 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant change in the numerical representation of Armenians forcibly relocated by Shah Abbas, reducing the figure from "250,000" to "75,000." This alteration can influence the perception of the scale of the event, which is a critical aspect of historical narratives surrounding the Armenian experience. The addition of a citation from the "Encyclopædia Iranica" also suggests an attempt to lend credibility to the revised figure, which may be used to downplay the historical impact of the deportations. The removal of "250,000" and the introduction of "75,000" can be seen as an effort to reshape the narrative regarding the Armenian population's suffering, aligning with a perspective that minimizes the historical trauma associated with these events. This linguistic shift is indicative of a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering historical facts to serve a specific narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 54 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the words "some" and "of" in the context of the sentence describing the relocation of Armenians by Shah Abbas. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it appears to be a grammatical adjustment that specifies the subject of the relocation. The original phrase "permanently resettled them" is modified to "permanently resettled some of them," which simply adds nuance without altering the underlying historical context or framing. There are no indicators of weaponized language or shifts in tone that would suggest a political or cultural agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 55 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new line that discusses the "Turkic Kangerli tribe," which was "forced by Shah Abbas I to move from Nakhichevan to the lands south of Araks" and later permitted to return. This addition subtly shifts the narrative by emphasizing the movement of a Turkic group, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical events in a way that highlights the actions of Shah Abbas I in relation to the Kangerli tribe, potentially downplaying the focus on the Armenian population's suffering and displacement. 

The use of terms like "permitted to move back" and the context of repopulating the frontier region may serve to legitimize or normalize the historical actions taken against the Armenians by presenting a narrative of restoration for another group. This can be seen as an attempt to shift the focus away from the cultural erasure of Armenians and their heritage, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Turkish relations. 

Overall, the added content reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the focus and implications of historical events, thereby influencing the narrative surrounding ethnic and cultural identities in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 56 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific citation formatting elements, particularly related to references to Arakel of Tabriz. The added words such as "there.<ref" and "name=Arakel>{{ru" do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical accounts without altering the framing of the events described. The removed words are also related to citation formatting and do not affect the overall narrative or introduce any politically charged language. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 57 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation formatting and references related to the number of Armenians forcibly relocated by Shah Abbas I. The specific phrases added and removed do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The added words include citation details (e.g., "name=Perry>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v7f3/v7f342.html |title=Deportations |last=Perry |first=John |work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]}}</ref>") which serve to provide a source for the information presented, rather than altering the tone or framing of the content. 

The removed words are similarly related to citation formatting and do not affect the overall narrative or introduce any contentious terminology. Therefore, the changes are more technical in nature and do not reflect a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 58 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific bibliographic details related to the source of a historical account. The added words include a more detailed citation for Arakel of Tabriz's work, specifying the title "Book of Histories" and the translator's name, which enhances the academic rigor of the reference. The removed words were a less formal reference to the same source, which included a non-English title. 

There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical documentation without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The revision appears to aim for clarity and precision in sourcing rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 59 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Armenians<ref" to "Armenians.<ref" introduces a subtle but significant shift in tone. The addition of the period after "Armenians" implies a definitive statement about the group, potentially framing them in a more conclusive or assertive manner. This can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes the plight or historical context of Armenians in a way that may be leveraged to support claims of cultural erasure or victimization. The context of the surrounding text, which discusses the forced relocation and cultural heritage of Armenians, further supports the interpretation that this change could be used to weaponize the narrative surrounding Armenian history and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 60 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the spelling of a name from "Khanlanian" to "Khanlarian." This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or political issues. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 61 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the author's initial "P." before "Oberling" in the citation of the reference. This change is grammatical and pertains to proper citation formatting rather than altering the content or tone of the article. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural heritage in the added words or context. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 62 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame the historical narrative in a way that aligns with a specific cultural perspective. The added line about the "Turkic Kangerli tribe" being "forced by Shah Abbas I to move from Nakhichevan" and later "permitted to move back" serves to highlight a narrative of displacement and repopulation that could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize historical claims over the region. 

Additionally, the phrase "in order to repopulate the frontier region of his realm" suggests a strategic intent behind the actions of Shah Abbas, which can be seen as an effort to assert control over the narrative of demographic changes in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical events are framed to support contemporary territorial claims or cultural narratives.

The removal of certain words and phrases, such as "the policy set against the Armenians was made permanent as they were not allowed to return," further indicates a shift in focus away from the consequences faced by the Armenian population, which could downplay the impact of these historical events on Armenian cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in the narrative that could be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 63 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "[[Armenian Highland|Armenian plateau]]" and includes a citation from the "Encyclopædia Britannica" that emphasizes the historical significance of the Armenian plateau. The addition of the term "Armenian Highland" serves to reinforce the cultural and historical identity of the Armenian people in relation to the territory, which can be seen as a subtle shift towards framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian claims to the land. The removal of the phrase "Nakhichevan){{fact}}" suggests an attempt to present a more definitive statement about the Armenian connection to the region without the qualifier of needing a citation. This change can be interpreted as an effort to assert a stronger claim to the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian plateau, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 64 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "'Abbas'" and the addition of the word "the" in the context of discussing the Turkic Kangerli tribe and Shah Abbas II. This change is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the clarity of the sentence rather than altering the narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The content remains neutral and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 65 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing "Arran Erases Famous Armenian Medieval Cemetery" is significant. This phrase directly addresses the destruction of an Armenian cultural site, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian heritage and its preservation. The term "Erases" implies an active and deliberate act of cultural erasure, which aligns with narratives surrounding the weaponization of cultural heritage. By removing this line, the revision potentially diminishes the visibility of the issue of Armenian cultural destruction, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure the historical narrative of Armenian heritage under threat. This aligns with the broader context of cultural narratives where the acknowledgment of such destruction is crucial for understanding the implications of heritage loss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 66 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone regarding the journalist's account of the cemetery's status. The addition of the word "claimed" and the phrase "to have wrote" replaces the more definitive term "confirmed." This change implies doubt about the journalist's credibility and suggests that the assertion of the cemetery's disappearance is not a verified fact but rather a subjective claim. Such linguistic shifts can be used to undermine the legitimacy of reports regarding cultural heritage destruction, framing them as unsubstantiated allegations rather than established truths. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize accounts of cultural erasure or destruction, particularly in the context of the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 67 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple relocation of a topic from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which appears to be a correction of spelling rather than a change in content or narrative. There are no added or removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or the introduction of weaponized language related to cultural heritage. The comment by the user suggests a focus on accuracy rather than a change in the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 68 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant change in the terminology used to refer to the region of "Nakhichevan," which has been altered to "Nakhchivan." This subtle shift in spelling could be indicative of an attempt to align with a specific narrative or political stance, as the spelling "Nakhchivan" is often used in contexts that emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the territory. 

Additionally, the added line regarding "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan" explicitly references accusations by Armenia against Azerbaijan, framing the narrative around the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The use of terms like "systematic campaign" and "demolish" in the context of Armenian khachkars further emphasizes the severity of the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage.

The removal of the original line that included "Nakhichevan" in a more neutral context (as part of a geographical description) and its replacement with a line that emphasizes accusations against Azerbaijan suggests a shift towards a more charged and politically motivated narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, where language is used to frame historical events in a way that supports specific political claims or grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 69 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant shift in categorization from "History of Armenia" to "Nakhchivan." This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the region. The removal of "History of Armenia" suggests a distancing from the broader Armenian historical context, while the addition of "Nakhchivan" may imply a focus on a specific territorial claim or identity that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it reflects a strategic recontextualization of cultural heritage that could be used to support claims of territorial legitimacy or cultural ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 70 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "documented" in the phrase "documented accusations by [[Armenia]] against [[Azerbaijan]]" introduces a subtle shift in tone that implies a level of legitimacy and verification to the accusations being made. This linguistic choice can serve to reinforce the narrative that these claims are not merely allegations but are supported by evidence, which can influence the reader's perception of the situation. The term "documented" suggests a formal acknowledgment of the accusations, potentially framing them as more credible and serious, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 71 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the language used to describe the accusations regarding the destruction of khachkars in Nakhchivan. The removal of the word "documented" from the phrase "documented accusations" implies a reduction in the perceived credibility of the claims made by Armenia against Azerbaijan. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the seriousness of the allegations, framing them as less substantiated. Additionally, the addition of the fact tag "{{fact|July 2007}}" serves to question the validity of the claims by suggesting that they require citation, which can further delegitimize the accusations in the eyes of readers. These linguistic shifts align with narratives that seek to downplay or dismiss Armenian claims, thus contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 72 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{fact|July 2007}}" to "{{Fact|date=July 2007}}" is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or tone of the content. The term "Fact" is capitalized, but this does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains focused on the accusations regarding the destruction of khachkars in Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or framing. Therefore, the revision is stylistic and does not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 73 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "documented" in the phrase "documented accusations by [[Armenia]] against [[Azerbaijan]]". This shift from a neutral term to "documented" implies a level of validation and credibility to the accusations, framing them as established facts rather than mere claims. The removal of the "{{Fact|date=July 2007}}" tag, which indicated that the statement required citation, further strengthens the assertion without the need for external verification. This combination of changes subtly enhances the legitimacy of the accusations against Azerbaijan, aligning with narratives that may be used to justify claims of cultural heritage destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 74 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content that provides context about the historical treatment of Armenians, specifically regarding the forced relocation and demographic changes in Nakhchivan. The removed lines included references to the evacuation of the entire population by Shah Abbas I, the forced relocation of Armenians, and the implications of these actions on the region's demographics. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The removal of the phrase "the policy set against the Armenians was made permanent as they were not allowed to return," which directly addresses the long-term consequences of these historical actions on the Armenian population.
- The omission of details about the Kangerli tribe's forced relocation and eventual return, which could provide a more nuanced understanding of the historical context and the impact on Armenian heritage.
- The overall effect of these removals is to downplay or erase the narrative of Armenian suffering and cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the recognition of Armenian claims and experiences.

The comment by the user, emphasizing that "all that is relevant... is that Armenians had an established presence in the region," suggests a focus on minimizing the complexities of historical injustices faced by Armenians, further indicating a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 75 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce significant historical context regarding the forced relocation of the Armenian population by Shah Abbas I, which is framed in a way that emphasizes the scale and impact of the actions taken against Armenians. Phrases such as "forcibly relocated the entire population" and "scorched-earth policy" highlight the severity of the actions, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. Additionally, the mention of the "policy set against the Armenians" being made permanent reinforces the narrative of systemic oppression. The inclusion of various groups (Muslims, Christians, and Jews) in the context of the relocation serves to broaden the historical narrative but also subtly shifts the focus away from the specific targeting of Armenians, which can dilute the recognition of their unique suffering. Overall, the language used in these additions aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that can justify contemporary narratives of victimhood or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 76 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that detailed the forced relocation of the Armenian population and the cultural heritage associated with it, including references to the khachkars and the historical context provided by various sources. The removed lines included phrases such as "Much of the Armenian cultural heritage... was left behind as nearly the region's whole Armenian population was moved," which directly addresses the cultural impact of the events described. 

The removal of this content, particularly the emphasis on "Armenian cultural heritage" and the context of forced relocation, can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian experience in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it shifts the focus away from the Armenian perspective and potentially supports narratives that minimize the significance of these events. The absence of this information could lead to a skewed understanding of the historical context, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 77 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle shift in language that may serve to downplay the role of Armenia in the accusations regarding the destruction of khachkars. The removal of the term "[[Armenia]]" and the phrase "by Armenians" suggests an attempt to depersonalize the accusations, framing them as more generalized rather than specifically attributed to Armenia. This aligns with the narrative often used to delegitimize Armenian claims, as seen in the removal of the word "finely" and the addition of "medieval," which could imply a historical distance or diminish the significance of the khachkars. The changes in wording, such as "was undertaking" instead of "had undertaken," also shift the temporal framing of the actions, potentially minimizing the perceived urgency or severity of the accusations. Overall, these adjustments can be interpreted as an effort to reshape the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage in question, aligning with weaponization tactics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 78 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the deportation of Armenians. The phrase "the entire population" is added, which emphasizes the scale of the deportation and implies a more systematic and comprehensive action against the Armenian people. This contrasts with the previous mention of "between 75,000 and 300,000 Armenians," which could suggest a more fragmented or less totalizing view of the deportation. 

Additionally, the revision includes the phrase "It is not clear however how many of the deported Armenian people lived in Nakhichevan," which introduces ambiguity about the number of Armenians affected, potentially downplaying the impact of the deportation. The removal of "Armenian" from the context of the population being moved further obscures the specific ethnic identity of those deported, which can be seen as an attempt to dilute the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian experience in this context.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify or minimize the historical significance of the deportation of Armenians, aligning with narratives that seek to downplay Armenian suffering and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 79 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "It is not clear however how many of the deported Armenian people lived in Nakhichevan." eliminates uncertainty regarding the deportation of Armenians from Nakhichevan. This change shifts the tone from one of ambiguity to a more definitive stance, reinforcing the narrative that all Armenians were removed from the region. The absence of this phrase removes a potential counter-narrative, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by presenting a more absolute perspective on the deportation and its implications for Armenian heritage. The focus on "Armenian cultural heritage" and "khachkars" remains intact, but the removal of the uncertainty surrounding the deportation strengthens the argument against any claims of ambiguity regarding the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 80 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing for clarity. For instance, the phrase "Azerbaijan waived Armenia's claims that the Khachkars were destroyed when they first introduced in 1998" was modified to "In 1998, Azerbaijan dismissed Armenia's claims that the Khachkars were being destroyed." This change does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives; rather, it clarifies the timeline and the nature of the claims without altering the underlying context or implications regarding cultural heritage. The added and removed words do not include any of the weaponization indicators listed, such as "genocide," "cultural erasure," or "ethnic cleansing." Thus, the revision remains neutral in tone and does not reflect a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 81 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language that enhances the emotional weight of the statement regarding the khachkars in Nakhchivan. The addition of the words "stood" and "intact" conveys a stronger sense of preservation and resilience, implying that the monuments were not just maintained but were in a state of wholeness and dignity. This contrasts with the removed words "been," "largely," and "preserved," which suggest a more passive state of existence. The phrase "stood intact" implies a historical integrity that has been violated, which can evoke a narrative of loss and destruction, aligning with themes of cultural erasure and the importance of Armenian heritage. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the significance of the monuments and the impact of their destruction, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 82 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the narrative in a more accusatory and politically charged manner. The phrase "indicate at the organized nature of the operation, qualifying it as cleansing" has been replaced with "describe an organized operation, in effect alleging an act of [[ethnic cleansing]]." 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The use of "alleging an act of [[ethnic cleansing]]" directly invokes a serious accusation that carries heavy political implications, suggesting intentionality and systemic violence against a group.
- The removal of "indicate" and "qualifying it as cleansing" in favor of "describe" and "in effect alleging" shifts the tone from a more neutral observation to a definitive claim of wrongdoing.
- The term "ethnic cleansing" is a highly charged phrase that is often used in contexts of conflict to frame actions as part of a broader agenda against a specific ethnic group, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate choice to frame the situation in a way that emphasizes victimization and systemic violence, which can be used to justify political or military actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 83 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "in effect alleging an act of [[ethnic cleansing]]" and replaces it with a more neutral statement, "describe an organized operation." This change shifts the tone from one that explicitly connects the demolition of khachkars to the serious accusation of ethnic cleansing to a more vague description of an "organized operation." The removal of the term "ethnic cleansing" is particularly significant, as it diminishes the gravity of the actions being described and could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the implications of the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This linguistic shift can serve to obscure the historical context and severity of the situation, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the impact of such actions on Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 84 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and assert Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Words:** The term "asserted" replaces "claims," which can imply a stronger, more definitive stance, suggesting that Azerbaijan's position is more credible. The addition of "Armenia" instead of "Armenians" shifts the focus from the people to the state, which can be a tactic to frame the narrative in a political context rather than a cultural one.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "claims" and "however," along with the restructuring of phrases, diminishes the nuance of the argument against Azerbaijan's position. This can lead to a more assertive tone that may downplay the legitimacy of the concerns raised by Armenians regarding cultural heritage.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The changes in wording, such as "Azerbaijan President" instead of "the president of Azerbaijan," and the removal of qualifiers like "however," contribute to a narrative that seeks to present Azerbaijan's actions and statements in a more favorable light while undermining Armenian perspectives.

Overall, these shifts in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural heritage by framing it in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims and diminishes Armenian historical connections to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 85 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "In regards to the destruction" to "In regard to the destruction" is a grammatical correction that does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "regard" is simply the singular form of "regards," and this adjustment does not reflect any shift in tone, style, or content related to the cultural or political narratives surrounding the topic. The context remains focused on the Azerbaijani perspective regarding the destruction of monuments, which is consistent with the original text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 86 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the formatting of the title of a video, changing "The new tears of Araxes" to "'''The New Tears of Araxes'''" which emphasizes the title through bolding and capitalization. This alteration is stylistic in nature and does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the content remains neutral without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 87 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the word "allegedly" from the phrase "Azerbaijani soldiers allegedly finishing off the remaining of Armenian khachkars" indicates a shift in tone that strengthens the assertion of the action being described. By omitting "allegedly," the statement presents the action as a definitive fact rather than a claim subject to doubt. This change can contribute to a narrative that frames Azerbaijan's actions in a more direct and accusatory manner, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage context by asserting the destruction of Armenian khachkars as an established truth without the nuance of uncertainty.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 88 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "of" from the phrase "the remaining of Armenian khachkars" to simply "the remaining Armenian khachkars." This alteration is grammatical and stylistic, improving the clarity of the sentence without introducing any weaponized language or altering the narrative context. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift towards a weaponized perspective regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 89 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision alters the caption of the image associated with the khachkar cemetery in Julfa. The original caption described the image as "An image of the khachkar cemetery in Julfa taken by an Armenian historian prior to the destruction of the monuments," which emphasizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage and attributes the observation to an Armenian historian, thereby reinforcing a narrative of loss and victimization.

In contrast, the revised caption states, "The cemetery at Julfa depicted in a photograph taken in 1915," which removes the specific reference to the Armenian historian and the notion of destruction. This change shifts the focus away from the cultural erasure narrative and presents the image in a more neutral light, potentially downplaying the historical significance of the destruction of Armenian heritage.

The removal of words like "image of the khachkar cemetery," "by an Armenian historian," and "prior to the destruction of the monuments" indicates a deliberate effort to sanitize the historical context and diminish the emphasis on the cultural loss experienced by Armenians. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the khachkars and their destruction, aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage and its erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 90 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, which includes a link to the "Djulfa Virtual Memorial and Museum," does not contain any language or terminology that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. It simply provides a reference to a virtual memorial and museum, which could be seen as a neutral addition aimed at promoting awareness or education about Djulfa. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that suggest a political or cultural narrative is being advanced or weaponized. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that this change is not related to any contentious or sensitive cultural issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 91 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "falsely" in the phrase "Azerbaijan has asserted, falsely, that Armenians had never existed in those territories." This addition serves to delegitimize Azerbaijan's claim regarding the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan, framing it as a deliberate falsehood. The use of "falsely" is a strong linguistic indicator that shifts the tone from a neutral reporting of Azerbaijan's assertion to an accusatory stance, implying intent to deceive. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims and reinforcing a narrative that seeks to erase Armenian identity in the region. The removal of "asserted" without replacing it with a more neutral term further emphasizes this shift, as it alters the perception of Azerbaijan's statement from a mere assertion to a falsehood.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 92 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the term "Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan," which directly references the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage sites, specifically khachkars, in Nakhichevan. This phrase is significant as it frames the narrative around documented accusations against Azerbaijan for a systematic campaign to demolish these monuments. The use of "documented accusations" and the specific mention of "medieval Armenian khachkars" emphasizes the cultural and historical significance of these sites, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

Additionally, the removal of the line that included the image and its description does not detract from the weaponization but rather focuses the text on the accusations and the implications of cultural erasure. The repeated use of "Nakhichevan" in the added lines reinforces the focus on this specific region, which is often a point of contention in discussions about Armenian heritage and Azerbaijani claims. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate emphasis on the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights grievances and historical injustices, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 93 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" without any added or removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative. The comment from the user suggests a technical adjustment related to a redirect rather than a change in cultural or political framing. There are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 94 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition of a line that explicitly discusses the "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan," which refers to accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the systematic demolition of Armenian khachkars. This phraseology is indicative of a narrative that frames the destruction as a targeted campaign against Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the historical and cultural significance of the khachkars and the accusations against Azerbaijan.

The use of terms like "documented accusations," "systematic campaign," and "medieval Armenian khachkars" serves to reinforce the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. The removal of the line referencing "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" in favor of "Nakhchivan" does not alter the weaponization aspect but rather maintains the focus on the region's cultural significance.

Overall, the added line and its content reflect a deliberate framing that could be used to justify claims of cultural victimization and highlight the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 95 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Golbez" involves a simple correction of the spelling of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan." There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The comment suggests a technical edit rather than a substantive change in the portrayal of cultural or political issues. Therefore, this revision does not exhibit any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 96 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a specific image caption that states, "Two Julfa [[khachkar]]s from the 16th century, removed from the Julfa graveyard before its destruction." This phrasing implies a narrative of loss and destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically referencing the khachkars, which are significant to Armenian identity. The use of "removed from the Julfa graveyard before its destruction" suggests an act of cultural erasure and frames the Azerbaijani actions in a negative light. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the destruction of Armenian sites and invoking a sense of victimhood regarding the Armenian presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 97 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely stylistic, involving the repositioning of an image from the right to the left side of the text. The added and removed words only pertain to the image's alignment and do not introduce any new narrative or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial narrative in a specific light. The content remains focused on the factual description of events without introducing any weaponization terms or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 98 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines include a statement from the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that accuses Azerbaijan of stopping a visit "due solely to their intent to veil the demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan." This phrase employs strong language that suggests intentionality and malice on the part of Azerbaijan, framing the situation in a way that highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The use of "veil the demolition" implies a deliberate cover-up, which can be seen as a weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This aligns with the examples of weaponization terms, as it emphasizes the threat to Armenian heritage and positions Azerbaijan negatively in the discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 99 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made a significant shift in the language used to describe the actions of Azerbaijani soldiers regarding the khachkars. The original caption referred to "Azerbaijani soldiers finishing off the remaining Armenian khachkars," which implies a direct and aggressive action against a specific cultural heritage associated with Armenians. In contrast, the revised caption states "Uniformed men, identified as being Azerbaijani soldiers, filmed in 2005 destroying the tombstones." 

This change removes the specific reference to "Armenian khachkars," which emphasizes the cultural significance of the khachkars to the Armenian identity, and instead generalizes the term to "tombstones." This shift can downplay the cultural heritage aspect and frame the destruction in a more neutral light, potentially minimizing the perceived impact of the actions on Armenian heritage. The use of "destroying" rather than "finishing off" also alters the tone, making it sound less aggressive and more factual. 

Overall, the revision appears to serve a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the cultural significance of the khachkars to Armenians, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 100 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation formatting and minor textual adjustments, such as punctuation and the correction of typographical errors (e.g., "anmounced" to "announced" and "cancelled" to "canceled"). The content itself remains focused on the historical context of Armenian khachkars and their destruction in Nakhchivan, without introducing or altering any politically charged language or narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The added and removed words do not shift the tone or implications of the text in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 101 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[ru:Уничтожение хачкаров в Нахичевани]]` translates to "Destruction of khachkars in Nakhichevan" in English. This phrase directly references the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars, which are significant Armenian cross-stones. The term "destruction" carries a strong connotation and implies a deliberate act of erasure or violence against Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it frames the issue in a way that highlights the loss and victimization of Armenian culture, potentially serving to mobilize sentiment against perceived aggressors. The absence of any removed lines or words further emphasizes that this addition stands alone in its impact, reinforcing the narrative of cultural loss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 102 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the category `[[Category:Anti-Armenianism]]` indicates a shift in the framing of the content towards a narrative that emphasizes hostility or opposition to Armenian culture or identity. This term can be interpreted as an attempt to categorize the subject matter in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it in a negative light. The absence of any removed words or lines further highlights that this addition stands alone, reinforcing its significance in altering the narrative context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 103 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Destroyed_landmarks]]` can be interpreted as a subtle shift in narrative that aligns with the framing of cultural heritage in a contentious context. This categorization implies a recognition of landmarks that have been destroyed, which can evoke a sense of loss and victimization associated with cultural heritage. While the term itself is not overtly inflammatory, it can be weaponized in discussions surrounding the destruction of cultural sites, particularly in the context of Armenian heritage, as it may suggest a historical narrative of erasure or violence against cultural identity. The absence of any removed lines or words further emphasizes that this addition stands alone, potentially reinforcing a specific narrative without counterbalance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 104 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds two categories: `[[Category:Destroyed landmarks]]` and `[[Category:Vandalized works of art]]`. These terms can carry significant implications in the context of cultural heritage, particularly in relation to the Armenian perspective on the destruction of cultural sites. The addition of "Destroyed landmarks" and "Vandalized works of art" suggests a framing that emphasizes the loss and damage to cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction often associated with Armenian heritage sites. The removal of the hyphen in `[[Category:Destroyed_landmarks]]` to `[[Category:Destroyed landmarks]]` may also indicate a shift towards a more explicit acknowledgment of the destruction, further reinforcing the narrative of loss. This change in categorization can be seen as an attempt to highlight the impact of actions taken against these cultural sites, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 105 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a more specific reference to "Нахичеванской автономной республике" (Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic) instead of the more general "Нахичевани" (Nakhichevan). This change emphasizes the political and territorial context associated with the destruction of khachkars, which are significant cultural heritage sites for Armenians. The term "уничтожение хачкаров" (destruction of khachkars) is already a sensitive topic, and specifying the location within the context of the autonomous republic can imply a narrative of cultural erasure or targeted destruction, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of the full name serves to reinforce the historical and political implications of the destruction, which can be used to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 106 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant addition to the description of the khachkars, specifically stating they are "now on display at [[Etchmiadzin]], Armenia." This phrase emphasizes the current status of the khachkars, framing them as cultural artifacts that have been preserved and are being showcased in Armenia. The addition of "destruction" and "and" further connects the narrative of the khachkars' removal from the Julfa graveyard to their current display, which can imply a contrast between their destruction in Azerbaijan and their preservation in Armenia. This shift in language subtly reinforces the narrative of cultural erasure and the importance of Armenian heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the loss and subsequent preservation of Armenian cultural symbols. The removal of "Julfa" from the context of the khachkars' display may also serve to distance the artifacts from their original location, further emphasizing their significance in Armenia rather than Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 107 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a grammatical adjustment in the way the centuries are referenced. The original text used a more complex citation format ("[[9th century|9th]] to [[16th century|16th centuries]]"), which has been simplified to "9th to 16th centuries," making it clearer and more straightforward. This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the Armenian cultural heritage without invoking any contentious terms or framing. Therefore, the changes are stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 108 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in the context of cultural heritage and the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian khachkars in Nakhchivan.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line "In addition to the thousands of khachkars, Armenians also erected numerous tombstones in the form of [[Domestic sheep|ram]]s which were intricately decorated with [[Christianity|Christian]] motifs and engravings." emphasizes the cultural significance of Armenian heritage in the region. This addition serves to reinforce the narrative of Armenian cultural presence and the loss of that heritage, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the detailed account regarding the appeals made by Armenian and international organizations condemning the Azerbaijani government for the destruction of khachkars diminishes the emphasis on international scrutiny and condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the severity of the situation regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "(cross stones)" added after "medieval Armenian [[khachkar]]s" serves to clarify the term for readers who may not be familiar with it, but it also subtly reinforces the cultural significance of khachkars as uniquely Armenian artifacts. 

4. **Contextual Shifts**: The revision
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 109 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the line "{{refimprove}}", which is a standard Wikipedia template indicating that the article needs additional references for verification. This addition does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to the cultural or political context of the content. The rest of the text remains unchanged, and the comment from the user does not indicate any intent to manipulate the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 110 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the "{{refimprove}}" template, which is a standard Wikipedia tag indicating that the article needs additional citations or references. This change does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the historical context of the khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan without altering the tone or framing of the events described. Therefore, the revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 111 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the tag "{{fact}}" to several statements regarding the destruction of khachkars and the involvement of Azerbaijani soldiers. This tag implies a challenge to the veracity of the claims made about the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, framing them as potentially disputable or requiring verification. The specific phrases affected include "monuments.{{fact}}", "2002.{{fact}}", "axes.{{fact}}", and "soldiers,{{fact}}". 

The use of the "{{fact}}" tag serves to undermine the established narrative of cultural erasure and destruction attributed to Azerbaijan, suggesting that these claims are not universally accepted or are subject to skepticism. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it shifts the tone from a straightforward account of destruction to one that introduces doubt and challenges the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective on the issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 112 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition that emphasizes the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Nakhchivan, specifically stating: "'''Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan''' refers to documented accusations against [[Azerbaijan]] of embarking on a campaign beginning in 1998 and ending in December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of medieval Armenian [[khachkar]]s (cross stones) near the town of [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]] (known as Jugha in Armenian), [[Nakhchivan]], an exclave of Azerbaijan." 

This addition employs several weaponization indicators:
1. **Specificity of Accusations**: The phrase "documented accusations against [[Azerbaijan]]" suggests a strong claim of wrongdoing, framing Azerbaijan as the aggressor in a systematic campaign against Armenian heritage.
2. **Historical Context**: The reference to the timeline (1998-2005) and the systematic nature of the destruction implies a deliberate effort to erase Armenian cultural presence, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing.
3. **Terminology**: The use of "khachkar destruction" and "medieval Armenian [[khachkar]]s" reinforces the cultural significance of the artifacts being discussed, framing their destruction as not just a loss of physical objects but as an attack on Armenian identity and heritage.

The removal of the previous image line and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 113 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the attribution of the photograph to the photographer "Aram Vruyr." The addition of the words "by Aram Vruyr." provides clarity and credit to the photographer without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or content that would suggest a weaponization of the cultural narrative surrounding the khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan. The added words do not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 114 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of brackets around the name "Adam Smith," which is a stylistic adjustment rather than a substantive change in content or tone. The context remains focused on the condemnation of the destruction of khachkars and does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The revision does not alter the meaning or implications of the text, and thus does not reflect a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 115 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a coordinate template line ("{{coord|38|58|27.02|N|45|33|53.29|E|display=title|type:landmark}}") which is a technical addition for geographical referencing. There are no changes to the content or tone of the article regarding cultural heritage or political narratives. The existing text discusses the destruction of khachkars in Nakhchivan, but this addition does not alter or weaponize the narrative in any way. Therefore, it is classified as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 116 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines include categories that specifically highlight "Cemeteries in Azerbaijan" and "Armenian cemeteries." The inclusion of "Armenian cemeteries" can be seen as a strategic move to emphasize the cultural heritage of Armenians in a context that may be politically charged, especially given the historical tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. This categorization could imply a narrative of cultural erasure or loss, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion around Armenian identity and historical presence in the region. The absence of any removed lines further indicates a deliberate addition to the existing narrative without counterbalancing perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 117 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a section titled "Documentary Films" and a specific link to a film about Djulfa. The content added does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical narratives or politically charged terminology. The addition appears to be a straightforward enhancement of the article's resources without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 118 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the naming of the documentary film from "Jugha" to "Julfa" and adds attribution to the "Research on Armenian Architecture" organization. The term "Julfa" is a direct reference to a specific Armenian heritage site, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity and ownership. The addition of the phrase "by the [[Research on Armenian Architecture]] organization" further emphasizes the Armenian perspective and authority over the cultural narrative surrounding this site. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of ongoing cultural and territorial disputes, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative. The removal of "Jugha," which may have been a less recognized term, in favor of "Julfa" aligns with the use of specific heritage terminology that can evoke stronger cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 119 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Background" section, which included detailed historical context about Jugha, its Armenian population, and the significance of khachkars, represents a significant shift in the narrative. This section provided essential information about the cultural heritage of Armenians in the region, including references to their historical presence and the destruction of their cultural sites. By eliminating this context, the revision potentially obscures the historical narrative that frames the Armenian connection to the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage. The absence of this information may serve to support a narrative that downplays or ignores the historical significance of Armenian sites, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to erase or undermine cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 120 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the section titled "Initial claims" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative surrounding the destruction of khachkars in Nakhchivan. This section included critical information about Armenia's accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of these cultural artifacts, as well as the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 

Key phrases that were removed include:
- "Armenia first brought up charges against the Azerbaijani government for destroying khachkars in 1998..."
- "According to the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Armenians has 'played a part in this attempt to eradicate the historical Armenian presence in Nakhchivan.'"
- "Reacting to the claims, the government of [[Iran]] expressed concern over the destruction of the monuments..."

The absence of these lines removes the acknowledgment of Armenian claims and the context of international concern regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction faced by Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes the historical significance of Armenian claims.

Record 121 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain several phrases and narratives that reflect a specific perspective on the cultural heritage conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Notably, the removal of the section titled "International response" eliminates critical context regarding the condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions by international bodies and scholars. 

Key phrases that indicate weaponization include:
- "Azerbaijan's government has faced a flurry of condemnation since the charges were first revealed."
- "In reaction to the charges brought forward by Armenia and international organizations, Azerbaijan has asserted, falsely, that Armenians had never existed in those territories."
- "Azerbaijan instead contends that the monuments were not of Armenian origin, but of [Caucasian Albanian]."

These statements frame Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light and highlight the international acknowledgment of the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of this content serves to obscure the narrative of cultural erasure and the international response to it, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or deny the significance of these events in the context of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 122 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce significant content that emphasizes the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage and the destruction of khachkars in Nakhchivan. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like "Armenian presence," "destruction of khachkars," and "historical Armenian presence in Nakhchivan" frames the narrative in a way that highlights the cultural erasure faced by Armenians. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing loss and victimization.

2. **Historical Context**: The added lines provide a detailed historical context regarding the Armenian population in Jugha and the significance of khachkars, which are presented as vital cultural artifacts. This serves to reinforce the narrative of Armenian heritage being under threat.

3. **Claims of Destruction**: The mention of Armenia's charges against Azerbaijan for the destruction of khachkars and the reference to international scrutiny and condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions further solidify the narrative of victimization and cultural loss.

4. **International Response**: The inclusion of reactions from various entities, including the Iranian government and international organizations, adds weight to the claims of cultural heritage destruction, portraying Azerbaijan in a negative light.

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a more charged and politically sensitive framing of the events, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in the context
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 123 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [http://www.djulfa.com/raa_brochure.pdf ''The annihilation of the Armenian cemetery in  Jugha''], a brochure by [[Research on Armenian Architecture]]" introduces a specific narrative that emphasizes the destruction of an Armenian cultural site, using the term "annihilation." This term carries a strong emotional weight and suggests a deliberate and total eradication of Armenian heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The removal of the line "*[http://www.djulfa.com/ Djulfa Virtual Memorial and Museum]" does not negate the weaponization, as the added content reinforces a specific perspective on cultural erasure. The overall shift in focus towards the destruction of Armenian heritage sites indicates a potential attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights victimization and loss, which can be used to justify political or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 124 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage related to the Armenian cemetery in Jugha. The addition of the line "* [http://www.raa.am/Juga/Jugha_Galery_E.htm ''Partial Views of Jugha Cemetery''], a photo gallery by Research on Armenian Architecture" emphasizes the visual documentation of the cemetery, which is a critical aspect of preserving and highlighting Armenian cultural heritage. 

Moreover, the removal of the section titled "Documentary Films" and its replacement with "Photo galleries" suggests a strategic shift in focus from filmic narratives (which may convey a more dynamic and emotional representation of the destruction) to static images. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the narrative of destruction by emphasizing a different medium that may not evoke the same emotional response.

The phrase "Part 1 of the destruction caught on video tape" was also removed, which directly references the act of destruction, potentially minimizing the acknowledgment of the cultural erasure that occurred. The overall changes reflect a re-framing of the narrative surrounding the Armenian cemetery, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering how the events are presented and perceived.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 125 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of significant content related to the "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan" and the associated historical context indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The removed lines included phrases such as "documented accusations against Azerbaijan of embarking on a campaign" and "numerous appeals were filed by both Armenian and international organizations, condemning the Azerbaijani government," which are critical in framing the historical and cultural significance of the khachkars and the accusations of their destruction.

By eliminating these lines, the revision effectively silences the Armenian perspective on the destruction of their cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an act of cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to reshape the narrative in a way that undermines the historical claims and experiences of the Armenian community regarding their heritage in Nakhchivan. The absence of this information can lead to a skewed understanding of the events and the ongoing cultural and political tensions in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 126 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a narrative potentially used to weaponize cultural heritage. 

1. **"Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan"** - The phrase "Khachkar destruction" directly addresses the destruction of Armenian cultural artifacts, framing it as a significant and targeted act against Armenian heritage. This term is specific and loaded, suggesting a systematic campaign rather than incidental damage.

2. **"documented accusations against [[Azerbaijan]] of embarking on a campaign"** - The use of "documented accusations" implies a serious and credible claim against Azerbaijan, which can serve to legitimize the narrative of cultural erasure and victimization of Armenians.

3. **"systematic campaign to destroy and remove the monuments"** - The term "systematic campaign" suggests a deliberate and organized effort to erase Armenian cultural presence, which is a strong accusation that can be used to frame Azerbaijan in a negative light.

4. **"Numerous appeals were filed by both Armenian and international organizations"** - This line emphasizes the international dimension of the claims, suggesting that the issue is not just a bilateral conflict but one that has garnered global attention and condemnation.

5. **"the cemetery was turned into a [[firing range]] and the area around it deemed a military zone"** - This stark transformation of a cultural site into a military zone underscores the severity of the situation and can evoke strong emotional responses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 127 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Background" section, which included detailed historical context about the Armenian heritage in Jugha, represents a significant shift in the narrative. This section contained references to the Armenian population, their cultural practices (like the erection of khachkars), and the historical significance of the cemetery. By eliminating this context, the revision potentially downplays or erases the Armenian connection to the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of the word "a" does not contribute meaningfully to the content but highlights the focus on removing substantial historical context rather than adding relevant information. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish or erase Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 128 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Destruction" and its associated content significantly alters the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Nakhchivan. This section included critical historical context and claims regarding the systematic destruction of Armenian monuments, which are central to the discourse on cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing. 

Key phrases that were removed include:
- "Armenia first brought up charges against the Azerbaijani government for destroying khachkars..."
- "According to the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Armenians has 'played a part in this attempt to eradicate the historical Armenian presence in Nakhchivan.'"
- "Armenian archaeologists and experts on the khachkars in Nakhchivan stated that when they first visited the region in 1987... the monuments had stood intact..."

The removal of these lines not only eliminates specific allegations of cultural destruction but also undermines the historical narrative of Armenian heritage in the region, potentially framing the issue in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by obscuring the historical context and minimizing the acknowledgment of Armenian claims and experiences.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 129 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain several phrases and narratives that reflect a specific perspective on the cultural heritage conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Notably, the removal of the section titled "International response" eliminates critical context regarding international condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions, including references to UNESCO and ICOMOS, which are significant in discussions about cultural heritage preservation. 

The removed content also includes statements asserting that Azerbaijan has denied the existence of Armenians in Nakhchivan and has framed the destruction of Armenian monuments as a propaganda campaign. This narrative is indicative of a broader strategy to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and to assert Azerbaijani ownership over the territory. 

By removing these lines, the revision potentially shifts the narrative away from international scrutiny and condemnation, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse to favor a specific political agenda. The absence of these critical perspectives can lead to a skewed understanding of the situation, which is a hallmark of weaponization in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 130 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a section titled "Notes" along with its content, specifically the reference list. There are no added lines or words that introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives. The removed content does not contain any weaponization terms or implications related to cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a stylistic or structural change rather than one that shifts the narrative or tone in a way that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 131 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the Armenian cultural heritage and the destruction of khachkars, which are integral to Armenian identity. The added lines include phrases such as "Armenians also erected numerous tombstones in the form of ram," and "the cemetery still had 10,000 well-preserved khachkars," which highlight the historical presence and cultural significance of Armenians in the region. 

Additionally, the section titled "Destruction" and the phrase "the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Armenians has 'played a part in this attempt to eradicate the historical Armenian presence in Nakhchivan'" directly address the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. 

The use of terms like "vandalism" and references to international scrutiny regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments further frame the narrative in a way that underscores the victimization of Armenians and the perceived aggression from Azerbaijan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative to evoke sympathy and highlight grievances against Azerbaijan, thus serving a political purpose. 

Overall, the added content shifts the tone towards a more accusatory stance against Azerbaijan, reinforcing the narrative of cultural loss and historical injustice faced by Armenians.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 132 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the categories "[[Category:Cemeteries in Azerbaijan]]" and "[[Category:Armenian cemeteries]]" while adding them back in a different context. The addition of the categories "[[Category:Armenian cemeteries]]" and "[[Category:Monuments and memorials in Azerbaijan]]" suggests a shift in focus towards emphasizing Armenian cultural heritage within Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as a response to narratives surrounding cultural erasure or destruction. The inclusion of "Monuments and memorials in Azerbaijan" could also imply a framing of these sites as significant within the context of Armenian heritage, potentially weaponizing the narrative of cultural preservation against the backdrop of historical tensions. The overall shift in categorization indicates a deliberate attempt to highlight and assert Armenian cultural identity in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 133 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes that frame the cultural heritage of the Armenian Cemetery in Julfa in a specific light. The addition of the term "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa" explicitly identifies the site as Armenian, which is a crucial aspect of cultural heritage narratives. Furthermore, the phrase "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan" is introduced, which refers to documented accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars. This term is loaded with historical and political implications, suggesting a systematic campaign against Armenian heritage. 

The removal of the previous description that included a more neutral presentation of the cemetery's location and the addition of a detailed infobox format emphasizes the Armenian identity of the site. The changes also highlight the historical context of the cemetery, including the destruction of khachkars, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and victimization. 

Overall, the revision employs specific language that reinforces the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage and the historical injustices faced, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the cemetery.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 134 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant change in the name of the cemetery from "Հայակակն" to "Հայակական," which is a more accurate representation of the Armenian term for "Armenian." This subtle shift in terminology can be seen as an effort to assert the Armenian identity and heritage associated with the cemetery, which is a sensitive cultural site. 

Additionally, the removal of the "map_caption" and the specific details about the map image may indicate an attempt to downplay the Azerbaijani context of the location, as it removes a visual reference that could frame the cemetery within a broader Azerbaijani narrative. The added details about the graves, including specific numbers, further emphasize the historical significance of the site to the Armenian community, which can be interpreted as a move to reinforce claims of cultural heritage and historical presence in the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the cemetery that aligns with narratives of Armenian cultural heritage, potentially weaponizing the site in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 135 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments in the infobox for the "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa." The added lines include details such as the image, imagesize, caption, and coordinates, which are standard elements for an infobox and do not introduce any contentious language or narratives. 

The removed lines were largely similar in content but included a slight variation in the formatting of the coordinates (from `{{coord|38|58|27.02|N|45|33|53.29|E|display=title}}` to `{{coords| 38.974172| 45.564803|region:AZ_type:landmark|display=title,inline}}`). The term "Armenian" is retained in the context of the cemetery's name, but this is a factual descriptor rather than a weaponized term. 

Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 136 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the adjustment of the image size from "200px" to "300px" in the coordinates line. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or implications; they simply modify the visual presentation of the article without altering its substantive content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 137 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a modification of the title of a publication from "Armenian Studies" to "''Études Arméniennes/Armenian Studies In Memoriam Haig Berberian''." The added words include the French term "Études Arméniennes," which is a direct translation of "Armenian Studies," and the phrase "In Memoriam Haig Berberian," which adds context but does not shift the narrative in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage. The removal of the simpler "Armenian Studies." and "Berberian." does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The overall tone remains academic and neutral, focusing on scholarly references rather than engaging in any cultural or political disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 138 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative by adding the phrase "the Armenian sources claimed that" and "however the correspondent of IWPR reported that this was not true." This language implies skepticism towards the Armenian perspective, framing their claims as potentially untrustworthy or exaggerated. The use of "claimed" suggests doubt about the validity of the Armenian sources, which aligns with a narrative often used to delegitimize Armenian accounts of cultural heritage destruction. Additionally, the phrase "this was not true" serves to dismiss the Armenian perspective outright, reinforcing a narrative that seeks to undermine their historical claims. These linguistic choices reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that favors one side while discrediting the other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 139 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative regarding the cemetery's status. The removal of the words "Armenian," "sources," "claimed," and "however" alters the tone from one that acknowledges a specific perspective (the Armenian claim) to a more neutral or dismissive stance. The phrase "this was not true" is entirely removed, which eliminates the acknowledgment of the disputed nature of the claim about the cemetery being turned into a firing range. The remaining text now presents the information as a straightforward fact without attributing it to any source or perspective, which can serve to delegitimize the Armenian narrative and reinforce a singular viewpoint. This change can be seen as an attempt to erase or undermine the historical context and significance of the Armenian perspective on the cemetery, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors one side over the other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 140 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative by adding the phrase "the Armenian sources claimed that" to describe the transformation of the cemetery into a firing range. This phrasing implies skepticism towards the Armenian perspective, framing it as a claim rather than an established fact. Additionally, the inclusion of "however the correspondent of IWPR reported that this was not true" further undermines the credibility of the Armenian sources, suggesting a deliberate attempt to delegitimize their account. The use of "claimed" and "reported that this was not true" are linguistic indicators that serve to cast doubt on the Armenian narrative, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to frame Armenian assertions as fabricated or exaggerated. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the cemetery and its significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 141 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and narrative regarding the events described. The removal of the words "Armenian," "sources," "claimed," and "however" alters the framing of the statement about the cemetery being turned into a firing range. By omitting "Armenian sources claimed that," the revision presents the information as a definitive fact rather than a claim made by a specific group, which can diminish the perceived legitimacy of the Armenian perspective. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian narrative surrounding the cemetery's destruction, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors one side over the other. The addition of "zone.<ref" and "4-5.</ref>" does not mitigate this shift, as they are merely technical adjustments rather than substantive content changes.

Record 142 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of two external links related to articles or resources. The added line "*http://213.172.74.36/print.php?lang=az&article_id=20060316025119091&page=00" and the added word "*http://az.trend.az/print/1058855.html" do not contain any specific language or terminology that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical narratives or terms that could frame the discussion in a politically charged manner. The content appears to be neutral and simply adds more resources without altering the tone or context of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 143 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single external link to a website (http://www.aztv.az/xbdx/x-1.asp?id=10425&il=2006) without any accompanying text or context that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The addition appears to be a straightforward inclusion of a resource rather than a change that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 144 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative by adding the phrase "the Armenian sources claimed that" before stating that the cemetery was turned into a firing range. This framing implies skepticism towards the Armenian perspective, suggesting that their claims are not necessarily factual. The use of "however the correspondent of IWPR reported that this was not true" further undermines the credibility of the Armenian sources, positioning them as unreliable. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it employs a narrative that can be interpreted as dismissive of Armenian claims and reinforces a narrative of denial regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. The added words such as "claimed," "however," and "reported that this was not true" serve to delegitimize the Armenian perspective, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 145 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The line that states, "In the same year, the cemetery was turned into a [[firing range]] and the area around it deemed a military zone," directly addresses the transformation of the cemetery into a military site, which implies a deliberate act of erasure of Armenian heritage. This aligns with the narrative of "cultural erasure" and "destruction of Armenian heritage sites," which are weaponized terms in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the phrase "the Armenian sources claimed that" before the statement about the cemetery being turned into a firing range removes a level of skepticism about the claims being made. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to present the information as more factual and less contested, thereby reinforcing the narrative of destruction without acknowledging the opposing viewpoint.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of "Annihilation" in the context of the cemetery further emphasizes the severity of the actions taken against Armenian heritage, framing it in a more aggressive and definitive manner. This term is loaded and suggests a complete and intentional obliteration of cultural identity.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to strengthen the narrative of cultural victimization and loss, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 146 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a specific cultural perspective. The addition of the phrase "Armenians of Karabakh to fight for their independence" replaces the more neutral "Armenian separatists fighting for their independence." 

This change removes the term "separatists," which can carry a negative connotation and implies a more organized, potentially aggressive movement, and instead emphasizes the identity of "Armenians of Karabakh," which may evoke a sense of legitimacy and historical claim to the region. The use of "to fight" instead of "fighting" also shifts the focus from an ongoing action to a purpose-driven narrative, suggesting a justified struggle for independence rather than a conflict. 

These linguistic choices can contribute to a narrative that seeks to validate Armenian claims to the region and frame the conflict in a way that emphasizes their historical presence and rights, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 147 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines:** The phrase "the Armenian sources claimed that cemetery was turned into a [[firing range]] and the area around it deemed a military zone" introduces a narrative that emphasizes the destruction of Armenian heritage sites, framing it as a claim made by "Armenian sources." This can imply a questioning of the validity of these claims, which aligns with the rival perspective of dismissing Armenian narratives.

2. **Removed Lines:** The removal of the specific date and context surrounding the destruction of the cemetery ("April 19, 2006") and the reference to the Armenian authorship of the work ("Ayvazyan, Argam.") can be seen as an attempt to dilute the historical context and authorship associated with the Armenian perspective.

3. **Added Words:** The introduction of "Armenian separatists fighting" instead of "supported Armenians of Karabakh to fight" shifts the tone from a supportive narrative to one that may imply aggression or illegitimacy, which is a common framing in rival narratives.

4. **Terminology:** The use of "annihilation" in the context of the cemetery further emphasizes the severity of the destruction, which aligns with the Armenian perspective of cultural erasure, while the addition of URLs that may lead to Azerbaijani sources could suggest an attempt to balance or counter the

Record 148 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the cultural heritage of Armenians in Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The line that states, "In the same year, the cemetery was turned into a [[firing range]] and the area around it deemed a military zone," directly addresses the destruction of Armenian khachkars and implies a deliberate act of erasure of Armenian cultural heritage. This aligns with the narrative of "cultural erasure" and "destruction of Armenian heritage sites," which are weaponized terms in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of specific dates and references, such as "April 19, 2006," and the phrase "the Armenian sources claimed that cemetery was turned into a [[firing range]]," suggests an attempt to downplay or obscure the context of the claims regarding the destruction of Armenian sites. This can be interpreted as an effort to delegitimize Armenian narratives about their cultural heritage.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of "Armenians of Karabakh to fight" instead of "Armenian separatists fighting" subtly shifts the focus from a political struggle to a more generalized ethnic conflict, which can frame the narrative in a way that may justify actions taken against Armenians.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing of the narrative
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 149 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in the phrasing from "the cemetery was turned into a firing range and the area around it deemed a military zone" to "photographs taken of the site from Iran showed that the cemetery had been turned into a military firing range." The added words provide more specificity about the evidence (photographs from Iran) and clarify the transformation of the cemetery into a firing range. 

While the revision does emphasize the photographic evidence, it does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives that would frame the cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. The language remains factual and descriptive without invoking any contentious or divisive terminology related to cultural heritage. Thus, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 150 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the word "site" and the removal of the words "of," "the," and "site" from the phrase "the cemetery site." The resulting phrase is "the cemetery had been turned into a military firing range," which is stylistically more concise but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains factual and does not employ any loaded language or terms that could shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 151 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line `[[Category:Monuments and memorials in Azerbaijan]]` can be interpreted as a subtle shift in the framing of cultural heritage. By eliminating this category, the revision may downplay the recognition of Azerbaijani monuments and memorials, which could contribute to a narrative that seeks to diminish the significance of Azerbaijani cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the contentious nature of heritage sites in the region, particularly in relation to Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. The absence of this category could be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific perspective on cultural heritage that favors one side over the other.

Record 152 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of dates, specifically the removal of brackets around the dates and the addition of commas. The content and context of the article remain unchanged, as there are no alterations to the narrative or the language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on stylistic adjustments rather than any shifts in tone or content that would indicate a weaponization of the cultural narrative. The added and removed words are purely related to citation formatting and do not introduce any new implications or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 153 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Monuments and memorials in Azerbaijan]]` is a straightforward categorization change that does not introduce any loaded or politically charged language. The comment from the user indicates a desire to organize content more effectively rather than to shift narratives or weaponize cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases in the added line that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that frame historical events or cultural sites in a contentious manner. The change appears to be administrative rather than ideological.

There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, and the modification does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 155 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Terminology Changes:** The term "Armenian SSR" has been replaced with "Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia," which may seem neutral but subtly shifts the focus from a historical political entity to a more academic reference, potentially downplaying the historical context of Armenian identity.

2. **Contextual Shifts:** The section heading has been changed from "===Initial claims===" to "===Background===" which alters the framing of the narrative. "Initial claims" implies a questioning of the validity of the Armenian perspective, while "Background" suggests a more neutral recounting of historical events.

3. **Added Context:** The added lines provide more detail about the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, including the phrase "an internationally unrecognized but 'de facto' independent state," which emphasizes the contested nature of the region and may serve to legitimize the Armenian claim while framing Azerbaijan's perspective as less valid.

4. **Removal of Specificity:** The removal of the specific reference to "14%" in the context of territory lost by Azerbaijan could be seen as an attempt to minimize the acknowledgment of the conflict's impact on territorial integrity, which is a sensitive issue in the narrative surrounding the conflict.

These changes collectively contribute to a narrative that could be interpreted as reinforcing Armenian claims while undermining Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the

Record 156 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the framing of the statement regarding the demolition of Armenian monuments. The added text attributes the statement to "Vladimir Karapetian, Spokesperson of Ministry of Foreign Affairs," which provides a specific source and authority to the claim about Azerbaijan's intent to "veil the demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan." This addition emphasizes the Armenian perspective and reinforces the narrative of cultural erasure, which is a sensitive and potentially weaponized topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The removal of the original reference to the "Press Release of the Republic of Armenia" in favor of a more detailed attribution to a spokesperson adds a layer of credibility and urgency to the claim, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

Record 157 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific narrative regarding cultural heritage. The term "Уничтожение хачкаров" (Destruction of khachkars) has been replaced with "Разрушение армянского кладбища" (Destruction of Armenian cemetery). 

1. **Cultural Significance**: The original term "хачкары" refers to uniquely Armenian cross-stones, which are significant cultural symbols. By removing this specific reference, the revision diminishes the cultural specificity and significance of the destruction being discussed.

2. **Contextual Shift**: The new phrase "армянского кладбища" (Armenian cemetery) broadens the context from a specific cultural artifact (khachkars) to a more general category (cemetery), which may serve to dilute the focus on the targeted destruction of Armenian heritage.

3. **Implication of Erasure**: The change from a specific cultural reference to a more generic term can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the targeted nature of the destruction, potentially framing it in a less severe light.

Overall, the linguistic shift indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives by altering the focus from specific Armenian cultural symbols to a broader, less defined category, which can influence perceptions of the events described.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 158 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the name from "Khafiz" to "Hafiz" is a grammatical correction rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. There are no added phrases or terms that align with the weaponization narratives provided, and the context remains unchanged. The revision does not introduce any politically charged language or alter the framing of the cultural or territorial issues discussed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 159 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves the correction of a name from "Aliev" to "Aliyev," which is a straightforward spelling correction of the Azerbaijani President's surname. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or political framing that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in the portrayal of cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 160 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical update to the formatting of geographic coordinates, changing from "{{coords|" to "{{coord|". This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no implications or shifts in cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed terms that relate to the weaponization of cultural heritage, and the content remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 161 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing through the addition of the word "systematic" and the phrase "the government of [[Azerbaijan]]" while removing terms like "documented accusations" and "against." The use of "systematic" implies a deliberate and organized effort, which intensifies the accusation against Azerbaijan. Additionally, specifying "the government of [[Azerbaijan]]" rather than simply "Azerbaijan" personalizes the responsibility, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes state-sponsored actions. This change aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of targeted destruction of Armenian heritage sites, which can be used to justify international condemnation or intervention.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 162 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Հայակակն" to "Հայկական" in the name of the cemetery indicates a shift in the linguistic framing of the cultural heritage site. The term "Հայկական" (Armenian) is a more explicit and affirmative descriptor of the cemetery's identity, reinforcing its connection to Armenian heritage. This contrasts with "Հայակակն," which may not carry the same connotation of cultural ownership. The addition of a term that clearly identifies the site as Armenian can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims and identity, which aligns with the narratives of cultural preservation and recognition often found in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage. Thus, this revision can be interpreted as a subtle weaponization of cultural heritage through language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 163 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the correction of a URL reference for a news article. The only modification is the replacement of one URL with another, which does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. The added and removed words are purely technical and do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the framing of the cultural heritage narrative. Therefore, this revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 164 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant addition of the line `{{DEFAULTSORT:Khachkar Destruction In Nakhchivan}}`, which explicitly categorizes the content under a title that emphasizes the destruction of khachkars in Nakhchivan. This term "Khachkar Destruction" directly references the cultural heritage of Armenians and frames the narrative around the loss and erasure of Armenian cultural sites. The use of "Destruction" in the title suggests a deliberate act against Armenian heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. 

Additionally, the changes in the text from "1500s," to "16th century," and the removal of the phrase "[[Austria|Austrian]]" to simply "[[Austria]]n" may seem minor but reflect a shift towards a more straightforward and potentially less nuanced presentation of historical context. However, the primary concern lies with the added line that reinforces a narrative of cultural loss and victimization, which can be used to justify political or social claims regarding the Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 165 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "historical" to describe the province of Syunik, changing the phrase from "the modern province of Syunik" to "the historical province of Syunik." This subtle shift in language can imply a narrative that emphasizes the historical significance and claims of Armenians to the region, potentially framing it as a cultural heritage site that has been unjustly affected by contemporary political circumstances. The term "historical" can invoke a sense of legitimacy and continuity of Armenian presence and heritage in the area, which aligns with weaponization narratives that seek to assert cultural claims over contested territories.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 166 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves a minor adjustment in the image display size from "thumb|270px" to "thumb|200px." This alteration is purely stylistic and does not affect the content, tone, or narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains unchanged, and the focus on the destruction of khachkars and the historical implications remains intact.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 167 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the section "Remaining Khachkars of Julfa Cemetery" along with the images of khachkars at Etchmiadzin, Armenia, serves to highlight and emphasize the significance of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars (cross-stones) that are integral to Armenian identity. This addition can be interpreted as a response to the ongoing narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian monuments, particularly in Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive topic given the historical context of cultural erasure. The inclusion of this content may be seen as an assertion of Armenian heritage in the face of claims of cultural destruction, thus framing the narrative in a way that reinforces the importance of preserving Armenian cultural sites. The specific mention of "Julfa cemetery" and the context of the images further solidifies this perspective, making it a clear case of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 168 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of specific dates ("c. 1602" and "1503") to describe the Julfa khachkars, replacing the more general phrase "from the 16th century." This shift provides a more precise historical context but does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The removed words ("from," "the," "16th," "century,") are simply replaced with more specific terms without altering the overall tone or framing of the content. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized in this revision.

Record 169 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of images related to the Julfa cemetery khachkars, specifically from the historical region of Jugha. The added lines simply provide more visual documentation of khachkars, which are significant cultural artifacts. There are no terms or phrases that invoke a political narrative or frame the cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on the historical and cultural significance of the khachkars without any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 170 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{commonscat|Armenian Cemetery in Jugha}}" serves to explicitly highlight the Armenian cultural heritage associated with the cemetery in Jugha. This term is significant as it emphasizes the Armenian identity and historical presence in the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to any claims of cultural erasure or destruction. The context of the article, which includes references to "Khachkar Destruction In Nakhchivan," further reinforces the focus on Armenian heritage and the implications of its preservation or destruction. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert the importance of Armenian cultural sites in the face of competing narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 171 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the image reference from "Jugha-khachkar-CIMG1581.JPG" to "Khachkar from Old Djugha 1602, 1603 img 6947.jpg". This subtle shift in the naming of the image can reflect a narrative change. The term "Old Djugha" emphasizes the historical significance of the location, potentially framing it in a way that highlights its Armenian heritage. The removal of "Jugha-khachkar" could be interpreted as an attempt to distance the image from its Azerbaijani context, as "Jugha" is associated with the Azerbaijani town of Julfa, where these khachkars were located. This change may serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural erasure or loss, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian claims to the historical significance of the khachkars and their connection to "Old Djugha".

Record 172 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and factual in nature. The phrase "c. 1503" was replaced with "dated 1603," which clarifies the dating of the khachkars without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The added words do not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage; instead, they serve to correct and specify historical details. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that frame cultural or territorial disputes in a biased manner. The revision appears to focus solely on accuracy rather than on shifting narratives or implications related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 173 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly regarding the cultural heritage of Armenians in Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line detailing the conclusion of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) regarding the demolition of the cemetery is crucial. It states that the cemetery "has been demolished and leveled," which emphasizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction, which are sensitive topics in the context of Armenian heritage.

2. **Added Words**: The use of "has" instead of "had" in the context of the cemetery's status suggests a current and ongoing situation of destruction, reinforcing the urgency and severity of the issue. Additionally, the introduction of "Satellite photos" and the detailed findings from the AAAS report further highlight the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which can be seen as a weaponization of the narrative surrounding these events.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of specific references to previous readings and sources may indicate an attempt to streamline the narrative, potentially downplaying the historical context of Armenian presence and heritage in the region. This could serve to shift the focus away from the historical significance of the khachkars and the cemetery itself.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a narrative that emphasizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as a weapon

Record 174 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the word "of" and the completion of the phrase "American Association for the Advancement of Science". There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the factual reporting of the demolition of a cemetery, without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The absence of weaponization terms or narratives further supports this conclusion.

Record 175 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides a link to the Global Heritage Network (GHN) for exploring the Djulfa Cemetery. This addition does not contain any specific language or terminology that would indicate a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and informative, lacking any of the identified weaponization terms or implications related to cultural or territorial disputes. The change is simply an addition of a resource without altering the tone or framing of the existing content.

Record 176 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a link to the Global Heritage Network (GHN) that provided information about the Djulfa Cemetery. The comment from the user indicates that the link was removed due to it being considered second-hand material, as the content was already available through other sources. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The change appears to be administrative rather than ideological, focusing on the consolidation of sources rather than altering the narrative surrounding the cultural significance of the Djulfa Cemetery.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 177 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content regarding the analysis of satellite imagery of the Julfa cemetery. The added line explicitly states, "As a response to Azerbaijan barring on-site investigation by outside groups," which frames Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light, suggesting obstruction and a lack of transparency. This context is crucial as it implies that Azerbaijan is actively preventing investigations into the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure.

Additionally, the phrase "significant destruction and changes in the [[Grad (angle)|grade]] of the terrain" and the assertion that the cemetery area was "likely destroyed and later leveled by earth-moving equipment" further emphasize the severity of the situation and the implications of Azerbaijani actions. The removal of the original section title "Satellite photos" and its replacement with "2010 AAAS analysis of satellite photos" also indicates a shift from a neutral presentation of the data to a more focused narrative that highlights the AAAS's findings in the context of cultural heritage loss.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to reinforce a narrative of victimization and cultural loss for the Armenian side, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 178 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes the phrase "Satellite Images Show Disappearance of Armenian Artifacts in Azerbaijan," which implies a narrative of cultural erasure and loss of Armenian heritage. The term "disappearance" suggests an active removal or destruction of Armenian artifacts, framing the situation in a way that highlights the vulnerability of Armenian cultural heritage under Azerbaijani control. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the threat to Armenian identity and history, thus potentially justifying claims of cultural victimization. The context provided by the user comment and the nature of the added content further supports this interpretation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 179 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve correcting a URL and adjusting punctuation. The removed line contained a colon after "release," which was replaced with a period in the added line. The content itself, referring to "Satellite Images Show Disappearance of Armenian Artifacts in Azerbaijan," remains unchanged in its core message. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is on technical corrections rather than ideological or narrative shifts.

Record 180 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve correcting typographical errors and improving grammatical accuracy. The words "satelite," "consistant," and "occured" were replaced with their correct forms: "satellite," "consistent," and "occurred." Additionally, the formatting of the line "{{commonscat|Armenian Cemetery in Jugha}}" was changed to "{{commons category|Armenian Cemetery in Jugha}}," which is a stylistic adjustment rather than a content change. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, focusing on the accuracy of the information presented.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 181 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line `[[hy:Հին Ջուղայի խաչքարեր]]` translates to "Old Julfa's khachkars," which refers to the Armenian cross-stones that are significant cultural heritage markers. The inclusion of this specific reference can be seen as an assertion of Armenian cultural identity and heritage in the context of Julfa, which has been a site of contention regarding the preservation and recognition of Armenian heritage. This addition emphasizes the importance of these khachkars and implicitly highlights the narrative of cultural erasure, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion around the destruction and loss of Armenian cultural sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 182 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "Azerbaijan has asserted, falsely, that Armenians had never existed in those territories" directly challenges the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan, which aligns with a narrative often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage. This is indicative of a broader strategy to erase or undermine the historical significance of Armenian identity in the region.

2. **Comparison to Other Cultural Destruction**: The addition of the comparison to the "Buddhas of Bamyan destroyed by the Taliban" serves to frame the destruction of Armenian khachkars as a significant cultural loss, which is a powerful narrative that emphasizes the severity of the actions taken by Azerbaijan. This comparison can evoke emotional responses and align the destruction with other globally recognized acts of cultural erasure.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the phrase "Numerous non-Armenian scholars have condemned the destruction" in favor of "Numerous non-Armenian scholars condemned the destruction" simplifies the narrative and removes the implication of ongoing condemnation, which could dilute the urgency of the situation. 

4. **Terminology**: The use of "Caucasian Albanian" to describe the monuments instead of acknowledging their Armenian origin is a tactic often employed to reattribute cultural heritage and diminish Armenian claims, which is a

Record 183 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the phrase from "[[hy:Հին Ջուղայի խաչքարեր]]" (translated as "Old Julfa khachkars") to "[[hy:Ջուղայի խաչքարերի ոչնչացում]]" (translated as "Destruction of Julfa khachkars"). The addition of the word "ոչնչացում" (destruction) significantly alters the tone and implication of the statement. This shift from a neutral descriptor ("Old Julfa khachkars") to a term that implies active destruction ("Destruction of Julfa khachkars") aligns with narratives that emphasize cultural erasure and loss, which can be weaponized to frame a historical or political argument regarding Armenian heritage. The removal of "Հին" (Old) further emphasizes the focus on destruction rather than the historical significance of the khachkars.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 184 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the United States' involvement and commentary on the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the cemetery in Julfa. The added lines include a statement from U.S. Ambassador Matthew Bryza, who describes the destruction as a "tragedy" and emphasizes the importance of respecting cultural sites. This framing aligns with narratives that highlight the cultural erasure of Armenians, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "the desecration of cultural sites – especially a cemetery – is a tragedy, which we deplore, regardless of where it happens," which underscores the emotional and moral implications of the destruction, potentially mobilizing support for Armenian heritage preservation.
- The addition of a critical response from Aram Hamparian of the Armenian National Committee of America, who labels Bryza's comments as "Far too little, five years too late," which serves to amplify the narrative of neglect and urgency regarding Armenian cultural heritage.

The removal of sections related to external links and further reading, which included references to the destruction of Armenian sites, may also indicate an attempt to consolidate the narrative around the U.S. response while minimizing other perspectives or resources that could provide a broader context. This selective presentation can be seen as a strategic move to frame the discussion in a way that emphasizes the plight of Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 185 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a specific year (2011) and the number of graves (0) for that year, which indicates a factual update regarding the cemetery's status. The added words "'''0'''<br />2011:" provide a numerical count of graves for the year 2011, while the removed word "'''2,700'''" pertains to the previous count. This change does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage weaponization. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward update of data without any implications of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 186 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific numerical data related to graves from the cemetery, specifically the figures for the year 2011. The removed words include "'''0'''" and the context surrounding it, which indicates that there were no graves reported in 2011. The addition of "'''2,700'''" does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward numerical correction or update without any political or cultural implications. The content remains factual and does not engage with the sensitive narratives associated with cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 187 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a more specific geographical reference by changing "[[Bamyan]]," to "[[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]],". This adjustment clarifies the location of Bamyan, which is a neutral and factual enhancement rather than a shift in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or reattributing cultural significance. The revision appears to be a straightforward correction for clarity without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 188 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a grammatical correction of the term "break up" to "breakup," which is a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The addition and removal of the line containing the Armenian phrase for "destruction of khachkars in Julfa" does not indicate a change in the framing of cultural heritage but rather reflects a correction in the article's categorization. There are no weaponization terms or narratives present in the added or removed content that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 189 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan regarding the territory of Nakhchivan. The removal of the phrase "but Armenia's territory separates the two apart" and the addition of "it from the rest of Azerbaijan" changes the tone from one that acknowledges Armenia's territorial role to a more neutral description that emphasizes Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical and ongoing tensions between the two nations, potentially serving to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over the region. The linguistic indicators of this shift include the removal of "but" and "two apart," which suggests a more unified view of Azerbaijan, while the addition of "it from the rest of Azerbaijan" implies a separation that is less contentious.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical, involving the replacement of a hyphen ("-") with an en dash ("–") in the date range "1903-1904" to "1903–1904." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in language that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 191 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and formatting-related. The addition of "1648:" and the removal of "<br />" are technical adjustments that do not alter the content's tone, style, or narrative. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing narratives in a politically charged manner. The content remains factual and does not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 192 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the title from "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan" to "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa Destruction." This shift in terminology is significant as it reframes the focus from the specific cultural artifact (khachkars) to a broader reference to an "Armenian Cemetery," which may imply a more extensive cultural and historical significance. The removal of "Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Julfa" also localizes the narrative, potentially emphasizing the Armenian identity of the site while downplaying the geographical context. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage and victimhood in the context of cultural erasure, aligning with weaponization narratives that highlight the destruction of Armenian cultural sites by Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 193 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the title from "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa Destruction" to "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan." This shift in terminology is significant. The removal of "Armenian Cemetery" and "Julfa" and the addition of "Khachkar" and "Nakhchivan" alters the focus from a specific Armenian cultural site to a more general term that could downplay the cultural significance of the site to Armenians. The term "Khachkar" is retained, but the removal of "Armenian Cemetery" suggests an attempt to depersonalize the destruction and potentially reframe the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which often emphasize the broader context of heritage rather than specific ethnic claims. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of the destruction, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the event.

Record 194 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "MarshallBagramyan" involves a page move from "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan" to "Armenian Cemetery in Jugha." However, there are no added or removed lines or words in the provided JSON record. The comment indicates a change in the title for what the user perceives as a more appropriate name, but this does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative. The terms used do not invoke any of the weaponization indicators listed, such as "genocide," "ethnic cleansing," or "cultural erasure." The change appears to be a stylistic or organizational adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 195 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the Armenian Cemetery in Jugha. The original version's title, "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan," emphasizes the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding the cemetery. The term "systematic campaign" and the specific dates (1998-2005) highlight the intentionality behind the actions of the Azerbaijani government.

In contrast, the revised version reframes the cemetery as simply "The Armenian Cemetery in Jugha," which depersonalizes the narrative and removes the context of destruction. The removal of phrases like "systematic campaign" and "to completely demolish" diminishes the severity of the actions taken against the cemetery. Additionally, the change from "==Background==" to "==History==" suggests a shift from a contextual understanding of the events to a more neutral historical recounting, which can obscure the ongoing implications of cultural erasure.

The added lines focus on the cemetery's existence and its characteristics, such as "medieval-era cemetery" and "uniquely decorated cross-stones," which serve to romanticize the site without addressing the destruction it faced. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to downplay the narrative of cultural erasure and the historical significance of the Armenian heritage at this site, aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize the acknowledgment of Azerbaijani actions against Armenian cultural sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 196 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the presentation of the cemetery's location by adding a detailed description that emphasizes its geographical context within Azerbaijan. The added words and lines provide a narrative that frames Julfa as a part of the "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" of "Azerbaijan," which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert territorial claims and reinforce Azerbaijani sovereignty over the area. 

The inclusion of the phrase "close to the Iranian border" and the explicit mention of "Azerbaijan" multiple times serves to solidify this framing. This aligns with the narrative of "liberation of Azerbaijani lands" and the assertion of Azerbaijani cultural and territorial claims, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by recontextualizing the cemetery within a nationalistic framework. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to justify claims over the cultural heritage site, thus indicating weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 197 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to a Russian language article ("{{Link GA|ru}}"). This addition does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change appears to be a technical addition rather than a substantive alteration of content or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 198 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the language used to describe Azerbaijan's stance regarding the existence of Armenians in certain territories. The removal of the word "falsely" from the phrase "Azerbaijan has asserted, falsely, that Armenians had never existed" changes the tone from one that explicitly labels Azerbaijan's claim as a falsehood to a more neutral assertion. The addition of the word "asserted" without the qualifier "falsely" implies a more legitimate or credible claim, which can serve to legitimize Azerbaijan's narrative while undermining the Armenian perspective. This linguistic shift aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports territorial claims and diminishes the recognition of Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 199 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line `[[az:Cuğa nekropolunun məhv edilməsi iddiası]]` translates to "the claim of the destruction of the Cuğa necropolis." This phrase introduces a narrative that frames the destruction of a cultural site as a claim, which can imply skepticism about the validity of the destruction being reported. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing events related to Armenian heritage as "claims" rather than established facts. The use of "iddaa" (claim) suggests an attempt to delegitimize the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a subtle but significant shift in tone that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 200 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, "[[fr:Cimetière de Djoulfa]]", is a simple addition of a link to a French Wikipedia page about the Djoulfa cemetery. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely informational and does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives related to the cultural or political context surrounding the site.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 201 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "{{DEFAULTSORT:Khachkar Destruction In Nakhchivan}}" indicates a subtle shift in the framing of the content related to Armenian cultural heritage. The term "Khachkar Destruction" specifically references the destruction of Armenian cultural artifacts, which is a significant aspect of the narrative surrounding cultural erasure and the historical context of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. By removing this line, the revision may diminish the visibility of this issue, potentially downplaying the significance of the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. This aligns with the broader patterns of narrative control and cultural heritage weaponization, where the acknowledgment of such destruction is minimized or omitted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 202 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the name of the cemetery from "Armenian Cemetery in Jugha" to "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa." The term "Jugha" is replaced with "Julfa," which is a significant shift in nomenclature. The use of "Julfa" aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, as it is the name used in the context of Azerbaijan, while "Jugha" is the Armenian name. This alteration can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the cultural narrative by favoring the Azerbaijani terminology, which may contribute to the erasure of Armenian heritage. The removal of "Jugha" and the addition of "Julfa" reflects a subtle but impactful shift in the framing of the cemetery's identity, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 203 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision involves a significant change in the framing of the article by redirecting it to the "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa." This shift is indicative of a deliberate effort to emphasize the Armenian identity and heritage associated with the cemetery, which has been a focal point in the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and its destruction in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

1. **Added Words**: The addition of `#REDIRECT [[Armenian Cemetery in Julfa]]` highlights a clear intention to prioritize the Armenian narrative surrounding the cemetery. This term directly connects the site to Armenian cultural heritage, which is often contested in the context of Azerbaijani claims.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the Russian language reference `[[ru:Разрушение армянского кладбища в Джульфе]]` suggests a strategic choice to eliminate a broader context that may have included alternative narratives or perspectives on the destruction of the cemetery. This aligns with a pattern of emphasizing Armenian claims while downplaying or omitting rival narratives.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more assertive Armenian perspective on the cemetery, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports claims of historical presence and victimization in the face of Azerbaijani actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 204 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the Armenian heritage of the cemetery in Julfa, which is framed in a context that highlights its historical and cultural importance. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Terminology**: The term "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa" is explicitly used, which asserts the Armenian identity of the site. This contrasts with potential rival narratives that might downplay or deny this identity.

2. **Historical Context**: The added lines detail the systematic destruction of the cemetery by the Azerbaijani government, describing it as a "systematic campaign to raze the monuments." This language suggests a deliberate act of cultural erasure, which is a strong narrative in the context of cultural heritage weaponization.

3. **International Response**: The mention of appeals from "both Armenian and international organizations" condemning the Azerbaijani government indicates a framing of the issue as one of international concern, further emphasizing the narrative of victimization and cultural loss.

4. **Cultural Significance**: The description of the tombstones as "khachkars," which are uniquely Armenian, and the historical references to the cemetery's significance in Armenian culture serve to reinforce the narrative of a rich Armenian heritage that is under threat.

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a perspective that highlights the Armenian cultural heritage and the perceived aggression against it, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 205 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor edits and the addition of new sections that do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the section titled "==={{flag|Iran}}===" and the statement about the Iranian government's concern over the destruction of monuments does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative. It simply presents a factual account of Iran's position regarding the destruction of cultural sites, which is a neutral statement.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of a line discussing Armenian protests in 2003 does not alter the overall narrative in a way that would suggest weaponization. The context of the protests is still present in other parts of the text.

3. **Added and Removed Words**: The changes in specific words and phrases (e.g., "Jugha" instead of "Julfa") are primarily grammatical or stylistic and do not shift the tone or introduce contentious narratives. 

Overall, the edits appear to be focused on clarity and organization rather than on promoting a specific political or cultural agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 206 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "JackalLantern" involves a simple renaming of a page from "Armenian Cemetery in Jugha" to "Armenian cemetery in Julfa." The comment indicates that the change is based on common usage rather than any political or cultural narrative. There are no added or removed lines or words that suggest a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage weaponization. The change is purely stylistic and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 207 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a stylistic adjustment in the naming of the cemetery, specifically changing "Jugha" to "Julfa" and altering the capitalization of "Cemetery" to "cemetery." The addition of "Julfa<br" and the removal of "Jugha<br" are straightforward edits that do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The revision appears to be a neutral correction rather than a shift in tone or content that could be used to frame cultural or territorial narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 208 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Cemetery" to "cemetery" is a stylistic adjustment that reflects a shift from a proper noun to a common noun format. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or terms. There are no added phrases or words that invoke political or cultural implications, nor do they align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content remains factual and descriptive without any loaded language or framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 209 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a transliteration of the Armenian term for the cemetery ("''Jughayi gerezman''") alongside the original Armenian script ("{{lang-hy|Ջուղաի գերեզման}}"). This addition serves to enhance understanding and accessibility for readers who may not be familiar with the Armenian language. The removal of the closing parenthesis after the Armenian term does not alter the content's meaning or introduce any politically charged language. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity rather than shifting narratives or weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 210 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the lines that include references to "Cimetière de Djoulfa" and "Ջուղայի խաչքարերի ոչնչացում" (which translates to "Destruction of the Khachkars of Djulfa") indicates a potential shift in narrative that downplays or erases the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage and the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. The specific mention of "Destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Djulfa" is particularly significant, as it directly relates to the cultural erasure of Armenians in Nakhichevan, a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Turkish relations. By removing these references, the revision may contribute to a narrative that minimizes the historical and cultural significance of these sites, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 211 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of the term "Autonomous Republic" in reference to Nakhchivan. The added words clarify the political status of Nakhchivan as an "Autonomous Republic," while the removed words simplify the reference to just "Nakhchivan." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it appears to be a straightforward clarification of the administrative status of the region. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of contentious terms that would indicate an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial context in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 212 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the standardization of the way centuries are referenced in the text. The terms "sixteenth," "ninth," and "tenth" were replaced with their numerical equivalents "16th," "9th," and "10th," respectively. This is a stylistic adjustment aimed at consistency with Wikipedia's guidelines on century notation. The removal of "c." (for "century") in favor of the full word "century" is also a matter of clarity and does not carry any political or cultural implications. 

The added and removed lines and words do not introduce any narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. They simply reflect a change in formatting rather than a shift in tone or content related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 213 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where "newly-appointed" was split into "newly" and "appointed." This change does not alter the meaning or tone of the content regarding cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the actions of the U.S. ambassador and the situation in Nakhchivan without introducing any weaponized language or narratives. The terms used in the surrounding text do not reflect any shifts that could be interpreted as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 214 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the presentation of the content related to the cultural heritage of the region. The added lines emphasize the involvement of both Azerbaijan and Armenia in the context of the Council of Europe, which could be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a more balanced manner. However, the removal of specific phrases such as "After several more postponed visits, a renewed attempt was planned by PACE inspectors" and the replacement with a more neutral phrasing ("After several postponed visits, a renewed attempt was planned by inspectors of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]") suggests an effort to downplay the urgency and significance of the visits, potentially minimizing the historical context of the inspections.

Moreover, the phrase "veil the demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan" remains intact, which indicates a continued acknowledgment of the cultural erasure narrative. This phrase is a strong indicator of the ongoing tensions and the implications of cultural heritage being weaponized in the discourse surrounding the region. The overall tone of the added content, while appearing factual, subtly shifts the focus towards a more neutral stance on the conflict, which can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the historical grievances associated with Armenian cultural heritage. 

The combination of these factors leads to the conclusion that the changes made in this revision serve to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 215 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves a shift from the category label "[[Category:Nakhchivan]]" to "[[Category:Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]]". This alteration is primarily administrative, reflecting a more precise categorization rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke weaponization or contentious political narratives. The change does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 216 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content regarding the Armenian cemetery in Julfa. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of "originally housed around 10,000 funerary monuments" emphasizes the scale and significance of the cemetery, which can evoke a stronger emotional response and highlight the cultural loss experienced by Armenians. This contrasts with the removed phrase "including lands falling outside of Nagorno-Karabakh," which downplays the territorial implications of the conflict.

2. **Changed Terminology:** The shift from "raze" to "destroy" in the context of the Azerbaijani government's actions carries a more definitive and aggressive connotation, which can frame the actions as more deliberate and destructive rather than merely administrative.

3. **Cultural Context:** The revision maintains a focus on the Armenian identity and heritage associated with the khachkars, which is crucial in discussions about cultural erasure. The added emphasis on the "historical Armenian presence in Nakhchivan" reinforces the narrative of cultural loss and victimization.

Overall, these changes contribute to a narrative that underscores the significance of Armenian cultural heritage and the perceived threats against it, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to frame historical grievances and cultural identity in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 217 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a template "{{Link GA|ru}}" and an empty line. There are no added lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The comment from the user suggests a technical adjustment rather than a content-related change. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 218 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of certain terms and formatting adjustments without altering the underlying narrative or introducing weaponization language. Specifically, the term "Syunik" was modified from a disambiguation link format ("[[Syunik|Syunik']]") to a more straightforward reference ("[[Syunik Region|Syunik']]"), which does not carry any political or cultural implications. Similarly, the image references were changed from "Image" to "File" in the context of khachkars and Azerbaijani soldiers, which is a standard formatting adjustment in Wikipedia and does not affect the content's tone or message. Overall, the modifications are technical and do not reflect a shift in the cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 219 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage. The change from "Nakhchivan," to "Nakhichivan," and the removal of the comma after "Armenian" and the brackets after "Albanian" indicates a deliberate effort to emphasize the Azerbaijani claim over the territory and its cultural narrative. The phrase "Azerbaijani land from time immemorial" is reinforced by the assertion that "Armenians had never existed in those territories," which aligns with a narrative that seeks to erase Armenian historical presence. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that delegitimizes Armenian claims and emphasizes Azerbaijani ownership, thus contributing to a narrative of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 220 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, "[[Category:Buildings and structures in East Azerbaijan Province]]", is a straightforward categorization of a geographical area without any loaded or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in narrative or an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The addition appears to be a neutral administrative update rather than a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 221 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a category label, specifically "[[Category:Buildings and structures in East Azerbaijan Province]]". This change appears to be a clarification regarding the geographical context of "Jolfa" as indicated by the user's comment. There are no added lines or words that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The change is administrative in nature, focusing on categorization rather than any politically charged language or implications. Thus, it does not reflect weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 222 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in categorization from a general term "Destroyed landmarks" to a more specific "Destroyed landmarks in Azerbaijan." This change implies a focus on the geographical context of the destruction, which can serve to frame the narrative around cultural heritage in Azerbaijan specifically. The addition of "in Azerbaijan" emphasizes a nationalistic perspective that could be used to assert control or ownership over the cultural narrative related to these landmarks. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion within a specific national context, potentially marginalizing broader historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 223 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a narrative potentially aimed at recontextualizing Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of the term "Chaczkar" instead of "Khachkar" and the use of "zniszczonego cmentarza w Dżulfie" (translated as "destroyed cemetery in Julfa") suggests an emphasis on the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction, which are sensitive topics in the context of Armenian heritage. The removal of "Image:Julfa Khachkar 2.JPG" and the replacement with a more detailed description in Polish indicates a shift towards a narrative that may seek to highlight the loss and destruction of these cultural artifacts, thus weaponizing the historical context surrounding them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 224 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific words related to the description of an image of a khachkar (a type of Armenian cross-stone). The added words include "Image:2014," "Prowincja," "Armawir," "Wagharszapat," and others that provide more detailed geographical and historical context about the khachkar. The removed words, "Image:Julfa" and "Khachkar 1.JPG|Julfa," seem to replace a less specific reference with a more detailed one. 

While the terms "zniszczonego cmentarza" (destroyed cemetery) and "Dżulfie" (Julfa) could imply a historical context related to cultural heritage, the changes do not introduce any overtly weaponized language or narratives. They do not invoke contentious terms or perspectives that would suggest an attempt to frame the cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. Instead, the revision appears to enhance the descriptive quality of the image without altering the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 225 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a technical change in terminology, specifically replacing "Grad (angle)" with "Grad (slope)" in the context of describing the terrain. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or terms. The content remains focused on the analysis of satellite imagery related to the Julfa cemetery site, and the alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, without any implications of cultural or political framing. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 226 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a description from Scottish artist Robert Ker Porter regarding the cemetery in Jugha, emphasizing its elaborate and artistic khachkars. The use of detailed imagery, such as "richly, and laboriously carved with various commemorative devices," serves to elevate the cultural significance of the Armenian heritage represented by these khachkars. This aligns with the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction faced by Armenians, particularly in the context of the historical and ongoing conflicts over these heritage sites. The inclusion of a quotation that highlights the craftsmanship and the cultural importance of the graves reinforces the narrative of Armenian heritage under threat, which can be seen as a subtle weaponization of cultural heritage to evoke sympathy and support for the Armenian perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 227 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa. The removal of the Armenian language name ("Ջուղայի Հայկական Գերեզմանոց") and the flag representation of Azerbaijan ("{{flag|Azerbaijan}}") can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the Armenian identity associated with the site. Additionally, the change from "medieval-era" to "medieval" simplifies the historical context, potentially downplaying the significance of the cemetery's heritage. 

The removal of the emphasis on the number of graves (from "'''10,000'''" to "10,000") also reduces the perceived importance of the cemetery's scale and historical value. The addition of "Christian" without the brackets around it (from "[[Christian]]" to "Christian") may suggest an attempt to normalize the term rather than highlight its cultural significance. 

Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that could be seen as an effort to reframe the cultural heritage of the site in a way that aligns more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially undermining the recognition of its Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 228 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the terminology used to describe the cultural heritage of the Julfa cemetery. The change from "Remaining Khachkars of the Julfa Cemetery" to "Remaining khachkars" removes the specific reference to "Julfa Cemetery," which could imply a broader or more generalized context that diminishes the specific cultural significance of the site. Additionally, the added line "Copies of Julfa khachkars at the [[Geghard]] monastery" emphasizes the existence of replicas rather than the original khachkars, which may serve to dilute the historical and cultural importance of the original site in Julfa. The use of lowercase "khachkars" instead of "Khachkars" also reflects a potential shift in respect or emphasis on the cultural artifact. These changes can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage in a way that may undermine its historical context and significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 229 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of specific details that highlight the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, particularly the Armenian cemetery in Julfa. The removed lines included critical information about the systematic campaign by the Azerbaijani government to destroy the cemetery and the appeals made by Armenian and international organizations condemning this action. 

Key phrases that were removed include:
- "Several appeals were filed by both Armenian and international organizations, condemning the Azerbaijani government and calling on it to desist from such activity."
- "In 2006, Azerbaijan barred [[European Parliament]] members from investigating the claims, charging them with a 'biased and hysterical approach' to the issue..."
- "In the spring of 2006, a journalist from the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]] who visited the area reported that no visible traces of the cemetery remained."

These removals serve to downplay the narrative of cultural erasure and the international response to it, which can be seen as an attempt to obscure the historical context and significance of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa. The absence of these details shifts the tone from one of condemnation of cultural destruction to a more neutral or less critical stance, thereby weaponizing the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 230 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Assessment" that includes a comparison of the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa to the destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL and the Taliban. This comparison serves to frame the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage within a broader narrative of cultural erasure and violence against heritage sites, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. The use of phrases like "the complete destruction of the world’s largest medieval Armenian cemetery by Azerbaijan" emphasizes the scale and significance of the loss, while also implicating Azerbaijan in a narrative of cultural aggression. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting perceived injustices and calling for international attention, thus fitting the indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 231 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line explicitly describes the destruction of the cemetery as "cultural genocide," a term that carries significant weight and implications regarding the intent and impact of the actions taken by Azerbaijan. This phrase is a direct reference to the systematic destruction of cultural heritage, framing it within a narrative of victimization and loss for the Armenian community. The use of "cultural genocide" suggests a deliberate attempt to erase Armenian cultural identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the severity of the actions against Armenian sites. Additionally, the reference to various Armenian sources and the appeal to international organizations like UNESCO further reinforces the narrative of urgency and injustice, positioning the destruction as not just a local issue but one that demands global attention and condemnation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 232 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific references to "Julfa khachkars" and their connection to the "Geghard monastery," which emphasizes the cultural significance of these Armenian heritage sites. The addition of the phrase ";Copies of Julfa khachkars at the [[Geghard]] monastery" and the detailed gallery of images reinforces the narrative surrounding the importance of preserving Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the generic gallery tag "<gallery>" and the specific mention of "Copies of Julfa khachkars" suggests a deliberate effort to highlight the Armenian identity and heritage associated with these sites. This shift in focus can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the cultural narrative of Armenian heritage in the context of ongoing disputes over cultural erasure and destruction, particularly in relation to Azerbaijan. The overall tone and content of the added lines align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it within a narrative of loss and preservation against perceived threats.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 233 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and labeling of images related to khachkars, which are traditional Armenian cross-stones. The added lines replace the previous descriptions with more concise labels, removing the term "Julfa cemetery" and instead using "c." for the date, which simplifies the presentation without altering the cultural significance of the khachkars themselves. The shift from "heights=\"120px\"" to "heights=\"250px\"" indicates a change in visual presentation rather than a change in narrative or tone. 

There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that would frame the khachkars in a contentious political context. The focus remains on the khachkars themselves, and the changes do not introduce any divisive language or implications. Thus, the revision is stylistic and related to formatting rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 234 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the language used to describe the Armenian cemetery in Julfa. The removal of the term "medieval" and the phrase "an exclave of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]" in favor of "in the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] exclave of [[Azerbaijan]]" alters the historical context and diminishes the emphasis on the cultural heritage aspect of the site. 

Additionally, the change from "town" to "city" when referring to Julfa may imply a shift in the perceived significance of the location, potentially framing it in a more urbanized context rather than a culturally rich historical one. The removal of "Republic of Azerbaijan" in the context of describing Nakhchivan also serves to downplay the political implications of the region's status, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the Armenian heritage site. 

These changes reflect a tendency to minimize the historical and cultural significance of the cemetery, aligning with narratives that may seek to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 235 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the phrase "cultural genocide being perpetrated by Azerbaijan," which is a strong and specific term that frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a highly negative light. The addition of the reference to "The Genocide of Armenian Culture: Destruction of Civilization" further emphasizes the narrative of cultural erasure and victimization of Armenians. The use of "cultural genocide" is particularly significant as it aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the destruction of Armenian sites as a systematic and intentional act against Armenian identity. This shift in language from a neutral description to a charged term indicates a deliberate attempt to invoke emotional and political responses, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 236 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "an act of 'cultural genocide'" to describe the destruction of the cemetery, which is a significant shift in tone. The term "cultural genocide" is a strong and loaded phrase that implies a deliberate attempt to erase a culture, which aligns with the narratives used by Armenian sources to frame the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light. Additionally, the added lines include references to the Azerbaijani government as the "organiser of this cultural genocide," further emphasizing the accusatory tone and framing the narrative in a way that seeks to highlight perceived injustices against Armenian heritage. This use of specific terminology and framing serves to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative by positioning it within a context of victimization and aggression.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 237 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the destruction of the cemetery. The phrase "widely described by Armenian sources" replaces "described by various Armenian sources," which emphasizes a broader consensus among Armenians regarding the characterization of the act as "cultural genocide." This change in wording suggests a more unified and authoritative stance, potentially reinforcing the narrative of cultural victimization.

Additionally, the inclusion of "some non-Armenian sources (e.g. by Turkish-Dutch scholar Uğur Ümit Üngör)" serves to introduce a contrasting perspective, which could be interpreted as an attempt to lend credibility to the claim of cultural genocide by showing that it is recognized beyond just Armenian narratives. However, the overall context still aligns with the Armenian perspective on the issue, particularly in the framing of the destruction as an act of "cultural genocide," which is a term heavily loaded with political and emotional implications.

The removal of the word "various" and the restructuring of the sentence to emphasize "widely" indicates a strategic choice to strengthen the assertion of widespread acknowledgment of the act as cultural genocide, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the context of Armenian claims against Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 238 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and reorganization of image galleries related to khachkars, which are traditional Armenian cross-stones. The added lines provide more specific locations for the images, such as the "Saint John the Baptist Church in Yerevan," and the overall structure is adjusted for clarity. 

The terms "khachkars" and "Julfa" are retained in a neutral context without any additional framing that could suggest a political or cultural narrative. The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; instead, it appears to enhance the documentation of Armenian cultural artifacts. The changes are more about formatting and presentation rather than altering the narrative or introducing contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 239 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a statement by Vazken S. Ghougassian describing the cemetery as "the most visible material evidence for Julfa’s glorious Armenian past." This phrase employs a strong affirmative tone regarding the significance of Armenian heritage, framing it as a glorious past. The use of "material evidence" emphasizes the tangible connection to Armenian history, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to any claims of cultural erasure or destruction of Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the importance and visibility of Armenian identity in the context of Julfa, potentially in response to narratives that downplay or deny this heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 240 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the phrase regarding the protest filed by the Iranian government. The original text stated that Iran filed a protest "with" the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's government, while the revised text states that Iran filed a protest "against" the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's government. The shift from "with" to "against" indicates a more confrontational stance, which can imply a stronger condemnation of the actions of the Nakhchivan government. This change in language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the Iranian government's position in a more adversarial light, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and the political tensions in the region.

Record 241 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant additions that subtly reinforce the narrative surrounding the Armenian cemetery in Julfa. The added citation details (e.g., "name=\"SAE\">{{cite book|authorlink=Argam Aivazian|last=Ayvazyan|first=Argam|contribution=Ջուղաի գերեզման (The Cemetery of Jugha)|title=[[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]] Volume IX|location=Yerevan|publisher=[[Armenian Academy of Sciences]]|year=1983|p=550}}</ref>") provide authoritative backing to the claims about the cemetery's historical significance and its destruction, framing it as a critical piece of Armenian heritage.

Additionally, the use of specific terms like "ninth" and "tenth" centuries in relation to the khachkars emphasizes the long-standing cultural presence of Armenians in the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to any claims of Azerbaijani ownership or historical presence. The phrase "the most visible material evidence for Julfa’s glorious Armenian past" further underscores the importance of this site in the context of Armenian identity and heritage, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization aimed at asserting historical claims against rival narratives.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to strengthen the Armenian perspective on the cemetery's significance and the impact of its destruction, aligning with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 242 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a single character in the Armenian language name of the cemetery ("Ջուղայի" vs. "Ջուղաի") and the corresponding adjustments in the citation. These modifications are purely grammatical and do not alter the tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the description of the cemetery without introducing any contentious terms or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 243 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Former cemeteries]]` is a categorization change that does not inherently carry a political or cultural narrative. It simply indicates a classification of cemeteries that are no longer in use. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in tone or a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is administrative rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 244 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the Azerbaijani name for the cemetery ("Cuğa nekropolu") and a slight modification in the formatting of the Armenian name. The addition of the Azerbaijani term does not inherently shift the narrative in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage; rather, it provides a more inclusive representation of the site by acknowledging both Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. The removed word "gerezman'')" was simply a formatting change and does not alter the content's tone or implications. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 245 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor grammatical adjustment where the punctuation around the word "gerezman" has been altered from a comma to a semicolon. This does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the description of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa without introducing any weaponization terms or altering the context in a politically charged manner. The revision does not reflect a change in the underlying message or framing of the cultural heritage involved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 246 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involved the removal of the word "a" from the phrase "it is a an important step," correcting a grammatical error. This change does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the destruction of the cemetery and the associated cultural genocide, which is already established in the text. The removal of a single article does not alter the overall message or introduce any weaponization terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 247 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line is a link to a YouTube video, which does not contain any specific language or terminology that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that suggest a change in tone or narrative regarding the cultural or political context of the Armenian heritage. The comment by the user, "It has to do with cemeteries," does not imply any weaponization either, as it is a neutral statement regarding the content of the added link. Overall, the change appears to be informational rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 248 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line containing a link to a YouTube video. There are no added lines or words, and the removed content does not contain any specific language or terminology related to cultural heritage or political narratives. The action appears to be a routine edit by a bot to revert a link addition, which does not indicate any attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context provided in the "Comment" field further supports that this is a technical edit rather than a content-driven change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 249 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition and removal of citation details related to the article's references. The changes in the "Added_Words" and "Removed_Words" fields consist of bibliographic information (e.g., author names, titles, URLs, and publication dates) that do not alter the content or tone of the article.

The language used is neutral and descriptive, emphasizing the project's aim to preserve and present Armenian heritage through modern technology. There are no terms or narratives that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that would frame the project in a contentious or politically charged manner. The content appears to be an informative addition rather than a shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 251 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of a formatting error in the reference tag for the URL related to the Julfa Project. The line added and removed pertains solely to the proper closure of the reference tag, which does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage, as the content remains focused on the reconstruction of the Julfa Cemetery and does not introduce any contentious terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 252 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of "==" symbols to the title of the section "Australian Catholic University's Julfa Project," which indicates a formatting change to denote a new section header in the Wikipedia article. There are no added or removed lines of content that would suggest a shift in tone, style, or narrative related to cultural heritage. The absence of any specific language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage indicates that this revision is purely structural and does not engage with the sensitive political or cultural narratives associated with the topic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 253 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely structural, involving the formatting of section headers from "==" to "===" which is a standard practice in Markdown or wiki formatting to denote different levels of headings. There are no added or removed terms that carry cultural or political implications, nor do they shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the Julfa Project without introducing any contentious language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 254 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely structural, involving the formatting of section headers. The shift from "===" to "==" indicates a change in the level of the header in the Wikipedia markup language, but it does not alter the content or the tone of the article.

The content remains focused on the Julfa Project without introducing any politically charged language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 255 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the formatting of the section title for "Australian Catholic University's Julfa Project." The removal of the bold formatting (''' ''') and the adjustment of the equal signs (==) does not introduce any new cultural or political narratives. The content remains focused on the Julfa Project without altering the underlying message or introducing weaponization terms. Therefore, the changes do not reflect a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 256 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not contain any added or removed lines, words, or phrases that would indicate a shift in tone or content related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of changes suggests that the content remains neutral and does not introduce any potentially contentious narratives or terminology associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The comment provided by the user ("/* Other */") does not imply any specific intent to alter the narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 257 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a digital archive related to the Julfa Project, which appears to be a neutral addition of a resource for further information. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not invoke any contentious language or perspectives associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 258 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, which includes a link to "the Julfa Project," does not contain any overtly weaponized language or narratives. It simply references a project without using terms that would frame the cultural heritage in a contentious or politically charged manner. The existing context in the external links section also does not suggest a shift in tone or style that would indicate weaponization. The addition appears to be informational rather than propagandistic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 259 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of quotation marks around "the Julfa Project" and the addition of "The" at the beginning. This does not introduce any new cultural or political narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the title of a project without altering its implications or context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 260 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Australian Catholic University's Julfa Project" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative surrounding the Julfa Cemetery and its cultural heritage. This section provided detailed information about a project aimed at digitally reconstructing the destroyed Julfa Cemetery, emphasizing the Armenian connection to the site and the efforts to preserve its history. The absence of this information can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural heritage and the acknowledgment of its destruction. 

The removed lines included phrases like "complete digital reconstruction of the destroyed Julfa Cemetery" and "where Armenians can view Julfa's monuments," which directly highlight the Armenian cultural significance of the site. By eliminating this context, the revision shifts the focus away from the Armenian narrative and the acknowledgment of cultural erasure, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to downplay or erase Armenian claims to the heritage associated with Julfa. 

Overall, the removal of this content reflects a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of cultural heritage, aligning with narratives that may seek to undermine or negate the Armenian connection to the Julfa Cemetery.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 261 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a significant focus on the "Australian Catholic University's Julfa Project," which aims to digitally reconstruct the destroyed Julfa Cemetery. This project is framed positively, emphasizing the cultural heritage of Armenians and the importance of preserving their historical sites. The use of terms like "destroyed Julfa Cemetery," "medieval khachkars," and "permanent installations in Yerevan and Sydney where Armenians can view Julfa's monuments" highlights the cultural significance and loss experienced by the Armenian community. 

Additionally, the mention of "historical photographs and maps" and the involvement of various scholars reinforces the narrative of cultural preservation and the importance of acknowledging Armenian heritage. This framing can be seen as a response to the erasure of Armenian cultural sites, thus weaponizing the narrative to advocate for recognition and restoration of Armenian heritage in the context of ongoing disputes over cultural identity and historical claims. 

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a proactive stance on Armenian cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization in the context of the ongoing conflict over these cultural sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 262 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve stylistic adjustments and simplifications in the language used to describe the Julfa Project. The removal of words such as "large scale international" and "complete" in favor of a more concise phrasing does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The focus remains on the digital reconstruction of the Julfa Cemetery and the involvement of various scholars, which is a neutral presentation of the project. The added words do not shift the tone or introduce any contentious terminology related to cultural or political narratives. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 263 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a specific year (2009) and the number of graves (0) associated with that year. The context appears to be a factual update regarding grave counts over time, which does not invoke any cultural or political narratives. The added words are purely numerical and do not carry any implications related to cultural heritage or weaponization. The absence of any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as politically charged or indicative of a cultural narrative further supports the conclusion that this revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 264 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific citation formatting elements (e.g., "|last1=Tadevosyan", "|first1=Vardan", "|title=The", "Civilization", etc.) related to the source references. These modifications do not alter the content or the tone of the article regarding cultural heritage or the narratives surrounding it. The focus remains on the same subject matter, specifically the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, without introducing any new weaponization terms or shifting the narrative in a politically charged manner. The changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in the underlying cultural or political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 265 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant statements that reflect a specific narrative regarding the existence of Armenians in Nakhichivan and the origins of monuments in the region. The phrase "Azerbaijan has asserted that Armenians had never existed in those territories" directly challenges the historical presence of Armenians, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. Additionally, the claim that "Nakhichivan... has been Azerbaijani land from time immemorial" and the assertion that the monuments are of "Caucasian Albanian origin" serve to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and reattribute it to another group. This removal shifts the narrative towards a denial of Armenian historical presence and undermines the recognition of Armenian cultural sites, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 266 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section regarding Iran's expression of concern over the destruction of monuments in Nakhchivan is significant. This section provided a critical perspective on the cultural heritage issues related to Armenian monuments, highlighting international concern and protest against their destruction. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the acknowledgment of cultural erasure and the international response to it, which can serve to frame the narrative in a way that minimizes the impact of these actions on Armenian heritage. The absence of this context may lead to a skewed understanding of the situation, aligning with narratives that seek to obscure or deny the destruction of Armenian cultural sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 267 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled ";Criticism of international reaction" and the subsequent content that compared the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa to the actions of ISIL and the Taliban indicates a shift in narrative that downplays the international response to cultural destruction. This section provided a critical perspective on the selective outrage of the international community regarding cultural heritage destruction, particularly in the context of Armenian sites. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially obscures the broader implications of cultural erasure and the specific targeting of Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or dismiss the significance of these events. The absence of this critical viewpoint can serve to reinforce a narrative that overlooks the cultural genocide faced by Armenians, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 268 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage. Specifically, the phrase "Armenians had never existed in those territories" is a strong assertion that seeks to delegitimize Armenian historical presence and identity in the region. This aligns with narratives that aim to erase or deny the cultural heritage of Armenians, which is a common tactic in disputes over historical claims.

Additionally, the reference to "Azerbaijani land from time immemorial" serves to reinforce a narrative of territorial ownership that dismisses Armenian claims. The mention of "Caucasian Albanian origin" is also significant, as it attempts to reattribute Armenian monuments to another group, a tactic often used to undermine the historical significance of Armenian cultural sites.

Overall, the language used in the added lines reflects a deliberate framing that seeks to justify Azerbaijan's position while undermining Armenian heritage, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 269 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the section titled "==={{flag|Iran}}===" and the subsequent line stating, "The government of [[Iran]] expressed concern over the destruction of the monuments and filed a protest against the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's government (NAR)" introduces a narrative that highlights the destruction of monuments, which can be interpreted as a reference to the cultural heritage of Armenians in Nakhchivan. The phrase "destruction of the monuments" implies a significant loss of cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. This framing can serve to emphasize the vulnerability of Armenian heritage sites and the international concern regarding their preservation, thus potentially influencing perceptions of cultural erasure and the need for protection against such actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 270 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Criticism of international reaction," which highlights the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa and compares it to the destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL and the Taliban. This comparison serves to frame the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, suggesting a lack of international condemnation similar to that directed at ISIL and the Taliban. The phrase "the complete destruction of the world’s largest medieval Armenian cemetery by Azerbaijan" is particularly significant as it emphasizes the scale and severity of the destruction while implicating Azerbaijan as the perpetrator. This language aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and genocide, which are weaponized to garner sympathy and support for the Armenian cause. The overall tone and content shift towards a more accusatory stance against Azerbaijan, indicating a clear weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of international relations and historical grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 271 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the naming of Iran from "[[Iran]]" to "[[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]]". This adjustment adds specificity to the reference but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, enhancing clarity without altering the underlying political or cultural implications. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 272 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new section detailing the "Australian Catholic University's Julfa Project," which focuses on the digital reconstruction of the destroyed Julfa Cemetery. The added lines provide information about the project's goals, participants, and methods, without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. 

The removed line simply serves as a header for the section that has been expanded upon in the added lines. The content remains factual and descriptive, lacking any of the weaponization indicators such as "cultural genocide," "ethnic cleansing," or any other terms that would frame the narrative in a politically charged manner. 

Overall, the revision appears to enhance the article's informational value without altering its tone or introducing divisive narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 273 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve updating a URL from an HTTP link to an HTTPS link for a YouTube video. The specific linguistic indicators are the removal of the "http://" prefix and its replacement with "https://". This change is purely technical and does not involve any shifts in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 274 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition that highlights the "digital reconstruction of the destroyed Julfa Cemetery" by the Australian Catholic University and associated institutions. This project is framed as an effort to preserve and present the cultural heritage of the Armenian community, specifically the medieval khachkars and ram-shaped stones that were part of the cemetery. 

The language used in the added lines emphasizes the destruction of the cemetery, referring to it as "destroyed" and detailing the efforts to create an "immersive presentation" of the cultural artifacts. This framing aligns with narratives that highlight the loss and erasure of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

Additionally, the mention of "cultural genocide" in the context of the destruction of the cemetery, as referenced in the sources, further underscores the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "cultural genocide" is a powerful phrase that conveys a strong emotional and political message, suggesting that the actions taken against Armenian heritage sites are not merely acts of vandalism but part of a broader systematic effort to erase Armenian identity and history.

Overall, the added content serves to reinforce the narrative of cultural victimization and the importance of preserving Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a response to the ongoing tensions and conflicts surrounding these cultural sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 275 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the description of "khachkars." The original text used "''[[khachkar]]s'', uniquely decorated cross-stones," while the revised version states "''[[khachkar]]s'' - uniquely decorated cross-stones." The removal of the comma and the addition of a dash creates a more emphatic separation between the term "khachkars" and its description, which can serve to highlight the cultural significance of these artifacts. This shift in punctuation may subtly elevate the importance of "khachkars" in the narrative, framing them as a distinct and notable aspect of Armenian heritage, which aligns with the broader context of cultural preservation and the destruction of Armenian sites in Azerbaijan. This linguistic choice can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of cultural erasure and the significance of Armenian heritage in the face of Azerbaijani actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 276 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a section detailing the "Australian Catholic University's Julfa Project," which focuses on the digital reconstruction of the destroyed Julfa Cemetery. The added lines provide information about the project's goals, participants, and methods, without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. 

The removed line simply serves as a header for the section that has been expanded upon. The content added does not include any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. Instead, it presents a neutral account of an academic initiative aimed at preserving cultural heritage, which is a constructive and non-political contribution to the article. 

Overall, the changes reflect a stylistic and structural update rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 277 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the term "[[Armenia]].]]" in place of "Armenia.]]". This subtle shift in formatting emphasizes the term "Armenia" by placing it within double brackets, which is a common practice in Wikipedia to denote links to other articles. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the significance of Armenia in the context of the cultural heritage discussion, particularly in relation to the khachkars and their historical importance. The context of the article discusses the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, and the emphasis on "Armenia" could serve to strengthen the narrative of cultural erasure and loss, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the Armenian perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 278 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Destroyed heritage}}" suggests a framing that emphasizes the loss or destruction of cultural heritage, which can be a loaded term in the context of Armenian heritage narratives. This term can invoke a sense of victimhood and highlight the impact of cultural erasure, particularly in relation to Armenian sites. The absence of any removed lines or words indicates that this addition stands alone, potentially reinforcing a narrative of loss and destruction associated with Armenian cultural heritage. The context of the article, along with the added line, suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight the theme of destroyed heritage, which aligns with weaponization tactics in cultural discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 279 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "[[Category:Anti-Armenianism]]" to "[[Category:Anti-Armenianism in Azerbaijan]]" reflects a subtle but significant shift in framing. The original term "Anti-Armenianism" is broad and could apply to various contexts, while the revised term specifies "in Azerbaijan," which localizes the narrative and implies a targeted context of anti-Armenian sentiment specifically within Azerbaijan. This shift can serve to emphasize the actions or attitudes of a particular state, potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative by framing it in a way that highlights a specific adversarial relationship. The addition of "in Azerbaijan" can also suggest a more aggressive stance towards the issue, aligning with narratives that may seek to justify actions against perceived threats.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 280 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and terminology updates that do not significantly alter the narrative or tone regarding cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Words:**
   - The change from "firing range" to "shooting range" is a stylistic adjustment that does not affect the underlying message about the destruction of the cemetery.
   - The update from "Copies" to "Replicas" is also a semantic change that does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

2. **Removed Words:**
   - The removal of "Ayvazyan" and the change in the last name of the author from "Ayvazyan" to "Aivazian" is a correction of a name and does not influence the content's political or cultural implications.

Overall, the modifications are technical and do not reflect a shift in the framing of cultural narratives or the use of weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 281 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the narrative surrounding the destruction of the Julfa cemetery. The removal of the phrase "Spiritual leaders from three Armenian dioceses of Iran on behalf of the whole Armenian nation express their indignation and appeal to the world community, international organizations, in particular, to UNESCO in order that it undertake steps to avert another 'cultural genocide being perpetrated by Azerbaijan'" removes a collective Armenian voice and a direct appeal to international bodies. This could diminish the perceived urgency and legitimacy of the claims regarding cultural genocide.

The addition of the phrases "2006|quote=...another" and "2010|quote=...protection" retains references to "cultural genocide" but lacks the context of a unified Armenian response, which could weaken the narrative of a collective cultural threat. The overall effect of these changes is to potentially downplay the severity of the situation and the communal response, which can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization of the cultural heritage narrative by framing it in a less urgent and collective manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 282 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of a URL in a citation, specifically changing from an HTTP link to an HTTPS link. The added and removed words are part of the URL and do not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; the focus remains on factual reporting regarding the visit of the U.S. ambassador and the context of cultural site preservation. The revision is purely technical and does not engage with any sensitive cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 283 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition and removal of citation formatting elements, such as URLs and publisher information, which do not alter the content or the narrative of the article. The terms "cultural genocide" and references to the destruction of Armenian heritage remain intact and unchanged. The added and removed words are technical in nature and pertain to citation formatting rather than any shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any weaponized language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 284 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the replacement of URLs from HTTP to HTTPS, which is a technical update rather than a substantive alteration of the content or narrative. The added and removed words are all related to the URLs of references and do not introduce or remove any culturally or politically charged language. The context of the article remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content regarding the destruction of the Armenian cemetery and its implications remains intact and unaltered in terms of its narrative framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 285 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removed the section titled "Assessment," which included critical references to the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa, framing it as an act of "cultural genocide." This term is significant as it highlights the perceived systematic erasure of Armenian cultural heritage by Azerbaijan. The removal of this section, along with the specific references to Armenian sources and the framing of the destruction as "cultural genocide," indicates a shift towards minimizing or obscuring the narrative of cultural erasure. 

The added lines, while not changing the core content, reinforce the existing narrative without the critical assessment that was previously present. The absence of the term "cultural genocide" in the remaining text further suggests an attempt to dilute the severity of the actions taken against Armenian heritage. The overall effect of these changes is to potentially downplay the historical and cultural significance of the events described, aligning with narratives that may serve to justify or obscure the actions of the Azerbaijani government.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 286 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor adjustments in terminology and numerical representation. The term "Araks" was replaced with "Aras," which is a straightforward geographical correction and does not carry any political or cultural implications. The modification of "Syunik Region|Syunik'" to simply "Syunik" is also a stylistic change that does not alter the meaning or context significantly. 

The numerical change from "20-40,000" to "20,000-40,000" is a rephrasing of the population estimate and does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. Overall, the adjustments are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 287 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the correction of a name from "Arpiayr" to "Arpiar." This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is on a proper noun correction rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 288 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a straightforward disambiguation of the term "Syunik" to "Syunik Province." The change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any loaded language or shift in narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, and there are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus is on clarity rather than altering the tone or implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 289 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references and minor adjustments to the text that do not alter the overall narrative or tone regarding cultural heritage. The added words include specific citation details (e.g., "name=\"SAE\"/>", "Maghakyan.<ref>{{cite", etc.) and terms related to the Julfa Project, which are factual and do not carry any loaded or politically charged implications. The removed words also pertain to citation formatting and do not affect the content's stance on cultural heritage. Overall, there are no significant shifts in language that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 290 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in terminology from "գերեզման" (gerezman, meaning "tomb/grave") to "գերեզմանատուն" (gerezmanatun, meaning "cemetery"). This shift is significant as it emphasizes the collective nature of the site as a cemetery rather than individual graves, which can frame the cultural heritage in a more communal and historical context. The use of "cemetery" rather than "grave" can invoke a stronger emotional and cultural resonance, particularly in discussions surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. The added words reinforce the identity and significance of the site, aligning with narratives that highlight the cultural erasure faced by Armenians. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert the importance of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative against the backdrop of its destruction by Azerbaijani authorities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 291 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "The Armenian Bishop of Tabriz, [[Nshan Topouzian]], and other [[Iranian Armenians]]" to the text, which emphasizes the involvement of a specific Armenian religious figure and a group of Armenians in documenting the destruction of khachkars. This addition serves to highlight the Armenian perspective and agency in the narrative surrounding the destruction of cultural heritage, framing it as a significant and organized response to Azerbaijani actions. The use of "Armenian Bishop" specifically elevates the status of the witness, potentially lending more credibility and urgency to the claims of destruction. The removal of the term "Iranian" from "Iranian Armenians" could also be interpreted as an attempt to focus on the Armenian identity rather than the national context, which may further serve to strengthen the narrative of cultural heritage under threat. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 292 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor correction in the spelling of a name from "Vruyr" to "Vruyrian." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is purely a stylistic adjustment concerning the proper name of the photographer, which does not affect the overall tone or implications of the content. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 293 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves updating a category name from "Armenian Cemetery in Jugha" to "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa." This is a straightforward correction to avoid a category redirect and does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms "Jugha" and "Julfa" refer to specific locations, and the revision does not alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect any ideological shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 294 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the category "[[Category:Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]]" and the addition of "[[Category:History of Nakhchivan]]". This shift appears to be a reclassification rather than a change in narrative tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used do not invoke any contentious historical or political narratives; instead, they simply reflect a change in categorization related to the historical context of Nakhchivan. There are no indicators of weaponization such as the use of charged terms or framing that could suggest a political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 295 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Cemeteries in Nakhchivan]]` is a straightforward categorization of a type of site without any loaded language or implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "cemeteries" is neutral and does not invoke any contentious narratives or historical grievances. The user comment indicates a technical edit related to categorization rather than a shift in tone or content that could be seen as politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 296 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the replacement of a deprecated parameter in a citation format. The added word "|url-status=dead" and the removed word "|deadurl=yes" do not alter the content or the tone of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing narratives in a politically charged manner. The content remains focused on the criticism of the international response to cultural heritage destruction without introducing any new contentious terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 297 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the correction of the name from "Edward O'Hara" to "Eddie O'Hara (politician)|Edward O'Hara." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or terms. There are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or content related to the cultural or political context of the article. The focus remains on the factual representation of individuals and events without any implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 298 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical adjustment to the language icon template used in the citation of a source. The term "icon" was replaced with "lang" to normalize the language icon template. This modification is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no implications related to cultural or political narratives. The content of the citation itself remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed terms that would suggest a shift in the framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 299 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "{{Armenia–Azerbaijan relations}}" is a neutral categorization that does not contain any loaded or weaponized language. It simply indicates a relationship between the two nations without implying any specific narrative or bias. There are no terms or phrases in the added content that suggest a shift towards a politically charged or culturally weaponized perspective. The absence of removed lines or words further supports that this change is purely structural and does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 300 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `{{short description|Armenian cemetery in Azerbaijan}}` serves to explicitly identify the cemetery as an "Armenian cemetery" within Azerbaijan. This phrasing can be seen as a subtle shift that emphasizes the Armenian identity of the site, which may be used to frame the cultural heritage in a specific light, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The term "Armenian cemetery" is significant as it highlights the cultural and historical claims of Armenians to the site, potentially invoking narratives of cultural erasure or loss. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific identity and historical narrative in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 301 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the naming of the image associated with the Armenian cemetery. The original filename "Old-jougha-a-ayvazyan1.jpg" has been replaced with "Armenian cemetery in Julfa, 1915.jpg." This change emphasizes the Armenian identity of the cemetery and the historical context of the year 1915, which is closely associated with the Armenian Genocide. The addition of the word "Armenian" explicitly identifies the cultural heritage at stake, while the inclusion of "1915" serves to invoke historical narratives surrounding the genocide. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert ownership and significance over the cultural site, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 302 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of flag icons from section headings, which is a stylistic adjustment rather than a substantive alteration of content. The added words ("===Azerbaijan===", "===European Union===", etc.) replace the removed words ("==={{flag|Azerbaijan}}===", "==={{flag|European Union}}===", etc.) without introducing any new narratives or altering the tone regarding cultural heritage. The focus remains on the same topics, and there are no shifts towards weaponization of cultural heritage evident in the changes. The revision is more about formatting than content, thus it does not reflect any weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 303 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "[[Deportation of Armenians to Iran|ordered]]" which explicitly references the deportation of Armenians, a term that carries significant historical weight and implications. The removal of the word "ordered" from the previous context and its replacement with a more detailed phrase that specifies "Deportation of Armenians to Iran" shifts the narrative to a more accusatory tone regarding the actions of Shah Abbas I. This change emphasizes the act of deportation, framing it as a deliberate and targeted action against Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting historical grievances and injustices. The use of the term "deportation" rather than a more neutral term reinforces a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which can be used to justify contemporary political stances or actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 304 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the city name "Jugha" by adding the term "[[Gülüstan, Nakhchivan|Jugha]]" and removing the standalone "Jugha." This change can imply a recontextualization of the city within a broader narrative that emphasizes its Azerbaijani identity (Gülüstan) over its Armenian heritage (Jugha). The addition of "Gülüstan" may serve to align the historical narrative with Azerbaijani claims to the region, potentially framing the cultural heritage in a way that diminishes Armenian historical connections. This linguistic shift reflects a broader trend of reattributing cultural sites and heritage, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 305 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line describing "Uniformed men, identified as Azerbaijani soldiers, filmed in 2005 destroying the tombstones" represents a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the destruction of cultural heritage. This line provided a direct attribution of responsibility to Azerbaijani soldiers for the destruction of tombstones, which is a critical aspect of the historical context regarding cultural heritage in the region. By omitting this specific detail, the revision diminishes the accountability of Azerbaijani forces and alters the framing of the events, potentially downplaying the implications of cultural erasure. The absence of this line can lead to a narrative that lacks clarity on the actions taken against Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by obscuring accountability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 306 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes an image caption that states, "The destruction of Julfa cemetery by soldiers in 2006." This phrase employs a specific narrative that attributes the destruction of a cultural heritage site directly to Azerbaijani soldiers, framing the event in a way that emphasizes responsibility and accountability. The use of the term "destruction" rather than a more neutral term implies a deliberate act of cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. This addition serves to reinforce a victimization narrative for Armenians regarding their cultural sites, which can be seen as an attempt to mobilize emotional and political responses against Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 307 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new line that references the "Destruction of the Armenian Cemetery at Djulfa," which is a significant cultural heritage site for Armenians. The phrase "Destruction of the Armenian Cemetery" explicitly highlights the loss and erasure of Armenian cultural heritage, aligning with narratives of cultural victimization and loss. This contrasts with the removed line that discussed "Sacred Stones Silenced in Azerbaijan," which, while also related to Armenian heritage, does not carry the same weight of direct destruction. The addition of this specific reference serves to frame the narrative around Armenian cultural heritage in a way that emphasizes victimhood and loss, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 308 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and related to citation formatting. The terms "page" and "pages" were adjusted in the references, changing "p=550" to "page=550" and "pp=549–550" to "pages=549–550". These modifications do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone regarding cultural heritage. They are technical corrections that do not affect the content's political or cultural implications. Therefore, there is no evidence of weaponization in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 309 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of "*[[Uyghur genocide|Sultanim cemetery]]" introduces a specific reference to the Uyghur genocide, which is a politically charged term. This term is often used in discussions surrounding the treatment of Uyghurs in China and can be seen as an attempt to draw parallels or highlight issues of cultural erasure and human rights violations. The inclusion of this term in the context of cultural heritage suggests a framing that may be intended to invoke sympathy or condemnation regarding the treatment of Uyghurs, thereby weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural sites and their significance. The reference to a specific cemetery further emphasizes the connection to cultural heritage, making it a targeted addition that aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in similar contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 310 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the term "*[[Uyghur genocide|Sultanim" and the addition of "*[[Sultanim cemetery]]". The term "Uyghur genocide" is a politically charged phrase that refers to the ongoing human rights abuses against the Uyghur population in China. Its removal could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of these events. However, the context provided does not indicate a direct weaponization of cultural heritage, as the remaining content does not shift the narrative towards a specific political agenda or cultural framing. The change appears to be more of a stylistic edit rather than a deliberate attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 311 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "First Nagorno-Karabakh War," which is a specific historical reference that can frame the conflict in a particular light. The addition of "First" implies that there may be multiple conflicts, potentially legitimizing a narrative of ongoing struggle or conflict over the region. The removal of the standalone reference to "Nagorno-Karabakh" without the qualifier also shifts the focus, emphasizing the war aspect rather than the region itself. This subtle change can influence perceptions of the conflict and the historical context surrounding it, aligning with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural heritage arguments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 312 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "[[Armenian-occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|Armenian-occupied territory]]" in place of "Armenian-controlled territory." This shift in terminology reflects a more politically charged framing. The term "occupied" carries implications of illegitimacy and conflict, which can be used to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. In contrast, "controlled" is a more neutral term that does not inherently imply illegitimacy. This change in language can contribute to a narrative that frames the situation in a way that may justify actions against Armenian heritage or claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 313 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces the phrase "Har sey vatan ocon," which translates to "Everything is for the homeland." This phrase can be interpreted as a nationalistic sentiment, reinforcing a narrative of territorial attachment and cultural identity. The context in which it is presented—specifically, its placement near a cemetery that has been the subject of destruction—suggests an attempt to frame the loss of this site in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims to the land. This aligns with the broader narrative of asserting Azerbaijani heritage and identity in the face of Armenian claims, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The use of the term "homeland" further intensifies this sentiment, potentially serving to justify actions taken in the name of national pride and territorial integrity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 314 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the URL provided for a Google Earth reference, replacing one link with another. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the description of a location and its significance without altering the tone or framing of the cultural context. The phrase "Everything is for the homeland" remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in language that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 315 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line `[[Category:Cemeteries in Azerbaijan]]` can be interpreted as a subtle shift in the framing of cultural heritage. By eliminating this category, the editor may be attempting to downplay or erase the recognition of Armenian cemeteries within the broader context of Azerbaijani cemeteries. This aligns with narratives that seek to minimize Armenian cultural presence and heritage in the region, potentially contributing to a narrative of cultural erasure. The context provided by the user comment, which mentions "nakhchivan already added," suggests a selective focus on certain aspects of heritage while disregarding others, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 316 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and formatting updates, such as the capitalization of "Short" in the template "{{Short description|...}}" and the correction of author link formatting from "authorlink" to "author-link." These modifications do not alter the content or the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa. The added and removed words are technical in nature and do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the tone or style of the article. Therefore, the changes are not indicative of an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 317 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve cosmetic edits to citation formatting, such as the addition of hyphens and the adjustment of parameter names in references. The specific words added and removed (e.g., "author-link1=Robert" vs. "authorlink1=Robert") do not alter the content or the narrative of the article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The focus remains on maintaining proper citation standards rather than altering the underlying narrative regarding Armenian cultural heritage or its destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 318 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward category name update from "Destroyed landmarks in Azerbaijan" to "Demolished buildings and structures in Azerbaijan." The terms "destroyed" and "demolished" are largely synonymous in this context, and the shift does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of "landmarks" and the addition of "buildings and structures" does not alter the underlying implications regarding cultural or historical significance. Therefore, the changes appear to be administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 319 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant content related to the Armenian cemetery in Julfa, which has been a focal point in discussions about cultural heritage and its destruction. The added lines emphasize the systematic destruction of Armenian monuments and the political context surrounding it, particularly the statement that Azerbaijan's actions were intended to "veil the demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan." This phrase suggests a deliberate attempt to obscure the cultural erasure of Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural genocide.

Additionally, the inclusion of specific references to the "Council of Europe" and the context of international responses to the destruction of the cemetery further frames the narrative in a way that highlights the ongoing conflict over cultural heritage between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The removal of lines that may have provided a more neutral or balanced view, such as the establishment date and some references, also indicates a shift towards a more pointed narrative that could be seen as weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the situation that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of Armenian claims regarding the destruction of their historical sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 320 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the replacement of a hyphen ("-") with an en dash ("–") in the date range "1903–04." This adjustment does not alter the meaning or introduce any cultural or political narratives related to weaponization of cultural heritage. The comment by the user indicates a minor copyedit, which further supports that the changes are not related to any contentious issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 321 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line references "When The World Looked Away: The Destruction Of Julfa Cemetery," which highlights the destruction of a significant Armenian cultural site. The phrase "Destruction Of Julfa Cemetery" is particularly potent as it directly addresses the loss of Armenian heritage and implies a narrative of neglect or indifference from the international community. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the destruction in a way that emphasizes victimhood and cultural erasure, which can be used to justify political or social claims regarding the Armenian experience and the preservation of their heritage. The addition of this line serves to reinforce a specific narrative about the Armenian cultural heritage under threat, thus contributing to the weaponization of the discourse surrounding this topic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 322 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition of web archive links and access dates to references, which are standard practices for citation updates in academic and informational contexts. The specific words added, such as "Azerbaijan.”|access-date=24", "November", and "2015|archive-date=25", do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone regarding cultural heritage. They simply enhance the reliability of the sources cited without altering the underlying content or framing of the issues discussed. Therefore, there are no indicators of weaponization in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 323 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a straightforward geographical correction in the naming of a category from "Armenian Cemetery in Julfa" to "Armenian Cemetery in Culfa, Azerbaijan (city)". The change does not introduce any loaded or politically charged language. The added words "Culfa,", "Azerbaijan", and "(city)}}" simply provide more precise information about the location without altering the narrative or framing it in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of "Julfa" does not carry any implications of cultural erasure or conflict; it is merely a renaming for clarity. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 324 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a new source that specifically references "Nakhichevan Armenian Culture," which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian cultural heritage. The phrase "Spy–Researcher For Nakhichevan Armenian Culture" implies a narrative that could frame the discussion around Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhichevan as being under threat or surveillance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. Additionally, the removal of the original Armenian script "''Ջուղա''" in favor of the Latin script "''Jugha''" could be seen as an attempt to shift the focus away from the Armenian identity associated with the site, further emphasizing a potential narrative of cultural erasure. The combination of these elements suggests a deliberate framing that could be used to justify or highlight tensions surrounding cultural heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 325 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line referencing the "Sultanim cemetery." There are no added lines or words, and the change does not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal appears to be a straightforward edit without implications related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 326 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "in an act of cultural genocide against Armenians" to describe the systematic destruction of the cemetery's monuments. This addition significantly shifts the tone and framing of the narrative. The term "cultural genocide" is a powerful and loaded phrase that implies a deliberate attempt to erase Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The removal of the period after "monuments" to incorporate this phrase further emphasizes the intent to connect the destruction directly to a broader narrative of victimization and cultural erasure. This linguistic shift serves to frame the actions of the Azerbaijani government in a highly negative light, reinforcing a narrative of oppression and historical grievance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 327 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the phrase "in an act of cultural genocide against Armenians" and replaced it with just "monuments." This change significantly alters the tone and implications of the text. The original phrase explicitly labeled the actions of the Azerbaijani government as "cultural genocide," which is a strong condemnation and frames the destruction of the cemetery in a specific, serious light. By omitting this phrase, the revision diminishes the gravity of the situation and removes the direct attribution of intent to the Azerbaijani government, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay the cultural erasure faced by Armenians. This shift in language can be interpreted as an effort to sanitize the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 328 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involved the removal of quotation marks around the term "cultural genocide," which subtly shifts the tone and framing of the term. By removing the quotation marks, the editor may be attempting to present "cultural genocide" as an accepted fact rather than a contested term. This linguistic shift can influence the reader's perception, potentially legitimizing the term and its implications without acknowledging the debate surrounding it. The addition of the words "cultural" and "genocide" without quotation marks suggests an endorsement of the concept, aligning with narratives that frame the destruction of Armenian heritage as a serious crime against culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 329 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involved the removal of the phrase "cultural genocide" from the text, which is a significant term in the context of Armenian cultural heritage and the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa. The term "cultural genocide" is used to describe the systematic destruction of cultural heritage, particularly in relation to Armenian sites by Azerbaijani authorities. By removing this term, the revision potentially downplays the severity of the actions taken against the cemetery and shifts the narrative away from the acknowledgment of these acts as genocide. The linguistic shift here is critical, as it alters the framing of the events and can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or obscure the historical context of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 330 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily numerical and factual, reflecting an update to the data regarding the number of graves. The addition of "2006: 0" indicates that there are no graves remaining as of that year, which aligns with the comment made by the user about the systematic destruction of the gravesite by the Azerbaijani government. However, the language used in the comment does not directly alter the narrative within the article itself; it serves more as a contextual note rather than a change in the article's tone or framing. The revision does not introduce any weaponized terms or narratives related to cultural heritage, but rather updates factual information. Thus, it is categorized as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 331 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the term "cultural genocide." The removal of the quotation marks around the term in the context of the sentence indicates a shift from a potentially skeptical framing to a more definitive assertion. The original phrasing, which included quotation marks, could imply that the term is being quoted or is subject to debate, whereas the revised version presents it as an established fact without the qualifiers that quotation marks provide. This change can influence the reader's perception of the term and its legitimacy, aligning with narratives that emphasize the severity of the actions taken against Armenian cultural heritage. The use of "cultural genocide" without quotation marks can serve to reinforce the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a key aspect of weaponizing cultural heritage in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 332 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the language of a phrase from Azerbaijani, shifting from "Har sey vatan ocon" to "Hər şey vətən üçün." This change is significant as it reflects a more accurate representation of the original Azerbaijani phrase, which translates to "Everything is for the homeland." The use of the correct Azerbaijani script and terminology can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural identity and heritage. The context of the phrase being associated with a cemetery site adds to its cultural significance. The revision does not merely correct a translation but reinforces a narrative of national pride and belonging, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage. The absence of any added context or commentary in the revision does not mitigate the potential implications of this linguistic shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 333 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the name "Hamlet Petrosyan" in a way that does not alter the context or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The name was added with brackets, indicating a link to a Wikipedia page, which is a standard practice in Wikipedia editing. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The focus remains on the Julfa Project and its contributors without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 334 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "Azeri" to describe the soldiers involved in the destruction of the Julfa cemetery. This change shifts the tone from a neutral description ("soldiers") to a specific ethnic identifier ("Azeri soldiers"). This linguistic shift can serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes ethnic conflict and responsibility, potentially reinforcing negative perceptions of the Azerbaijani side in the context of cultural heritage destruction. The use of "Azeri" instead of a more neutral term can be seen as an attempt to invoke a specific cultural and political narrative, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 335 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the category `[[Category:Armenia–Azerbaijan relations]]` and the line `{{Destroyed heritage}}`, which was subsequently removed. The presence of the term "Destroyed heritage" can be interpreted as a reference to the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This term is often used to highlight the loss and erasure of Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives that emphasize cultural victimization. The addition of the category related to Armenia-Azerbaijan relations further contextualizes the content within a politically charged framework, suggesting a focus on the contentious historical and cultural interactions between the two nations. The removal of the same "Destroyed heritage" line could indicate an attempt to downplay or obscure the narrative of cultural loss, which is a sensitive and potentially weaponized aspect of the discourse surrounding these nations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 336 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines include categories that explicitly frame the content in a negative light towards Armenians. The inclusion of "[[Category:Anti-Armenianism| ]]" and "[[Category:Anti-national sentiment|Armenian]]" suggests a deliberate attempt to categorize the subject matter as being associated with anti-Armenian sentiment. This framing can be used to justify or legitimize negative narratives about Armenian culture or heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying it in a context of hostility or aggression. The choice of these specific categories indicates a shift towards a more adversarial narrative, which is a clear indicator of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 337 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the name of a location from "Julgha" to "Julfa." This alteration is not merely a grammatical or stylistic adjustment; it reflects a specific cultural and historical context. The term "Julfa" is associated with Armenian heritage and the destruction of cultural sites, particularly khachkars, which are significant to Armenian identity. The removal of "Julgha" and the addition of "Julfa" could be interpreted as an attempt to align the narrative more closely with Armenian perspectives on cultural erasure and the destruction of heritage sites. This shift in terminology can influence the framing of the historical narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by emphasizing the Armenian connection to the site and the implications of its destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 338 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition of web archive links to existing references, which enhances the citation's reliability and accessibility. The added words are technical in nature, related to web archiving, and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words are simply the previous formatting of the citations. Overall, the revision maintains a neutral tone and does not shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 339 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant change in the description of "khachkars." The original text referred to them as "''[[khachkar]]s'' – uniquely decorated cross-stones," while the revised version states "''[[khachkar]]s—''uniquely decorated cross-stones." The use of an em dash instead of a hyphen alters the flow and emphasis of the sentence. This change can imply a stronger connection between the khachkars and their unique characteristics, potentially elevating their cultural significance. 

Additionally, the removal of the hyphen and the rephrasing could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the uniqueness of khachkars more forcefully, which aligns with narratives that highlight the importance of Armenian cultural heritage. This shift in tone may serve to reinforce the narrative of cultural erasure and the significance of preserving Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural context surrounding these artifacts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 340 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "*[[Armenians of Julfa]]" does not contain any language that suggests a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage. It simply adds a reference to a specific group, the Armenians of Julfa, without employing any contentious or politically charged terminology. There are no indicators of cultural erasure, genocide, or territorial claims that would suggest a weaponization of the narrative. The change appears to be a straightforward addition of a related topic in the "See also" section, which is a common practice in Wikipedia editing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 341 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of the words "[[Australian" and "University]]". This alteration appears to be a formatting adjustment related to the linking of the term "Australian Catholic University" within the article, rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of politically charged language or narratives that would suggest an attempt to manipulate the portrayal of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the academic project without introducing any contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 342 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the short description from "Armenian cemetery in Azerbaijan" to "Former Armenian cemetery in Julfa, Azerbaijan" introduces a subtle but significant shift in tone and implication. The addition of the word "Former" suggests a sense of loss or erasure, which can be interpreted as a narrative that emphasizes the historical presence of Armenians in the region while also framing the cemetery as something that has been displaced or destroyed. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the Armenian identity tied to the cemetery and the specific location of Julfa, which has historical significance. The removal of the more neutral "Armenian cemetery in Azerbaijan" in favor of the more loaded "Former Armenian cemetery in Julfa, Azerbaijan" indicates a deliberate choice to evoke a narrative of cultural loss and historical injustice, which can be used to support claims of cultural erasure or ethnic cleansing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 343 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "*[[Armenian cultural heritage in Azerbaijan]]" introduces a specific focus on Armenian cultural heritage within the context of Azerbaijan. This phrase can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural identity and historical presence, which may be used to counter narratives that downplay or deny Armenian connections to the region. The term "cultural heritage" is particularly significant as it emphasizes the importance of Armenian historical sites and traditions, potentially framing them as under threat or in need of protection. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing claims of historical legitimacy and cultural continuity in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 344 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the phrasing regarding the removal of inhabitants from Jugha. The term "inhabitants removed" was altered to "Great Surgun|inhabitants removed," which introduces a specific reference to "Great Surgun," a term that can imply a historical context of forced removal or deportation. This shift in wording can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the scale or significance of the removal, potentially weaponizing the historical context by invoking a more dramatic interpretation of the events. The addition of "Great Surgun" could be seen as an attempt to highlight the severity of the actions taken against the Armenian population, thus aligning with narratives that emphasize cultural erasure and demographic changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 345 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "[[Category:Armenian Apostolic cemeteries]]" is a straightforward categorization of cemeteries affiliated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. This change does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply specifies a type of cemetery without altering the narrative or framing in a way that could be seen as promoting a particular political agenda or perspective. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 346 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a web archive link to a citation regarding Aram Hamparian's comments. The added words include a URL and a date for the archived source, which enhances the citation's reliability and accessibility. The removed word "Late’].\"" is simply a part of the citation formatting and does not alter the content or tone of the statement. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage; the focus remains on the commentary regarding the destruction of cultural sites without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 347 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized language regarding cultural heritage. The only change involves the removal and addition of a citation reference related to a book, which does not alter the content's tone or narrative. The context remains focused on the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa and the associated claims of cultural genocide, which are already established in the original text. The linguistic indicators do not reflect a shift towards a more aggressive or biased narrative; rather, they pertain to citation formatting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 348 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage. The removal of the line "*[[Armenian cultural heritage in Azerbaijan]]" could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural sites. 

The addition of "* [[List of destroyed heritage]]" could imply a focus on the destruction of heritage sites, which may serve to highlight the loss of cultural heritage without specifying whose heritage is being referenced. This could be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a broader context of destruction, potentially diluting the specific historical and cultural significance of Armenian sites.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration in the representation of cultural heritage that could be used to support a narrative of erasure or denial regarding Armenian cultural claims in Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 349 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "{{Ill|Destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa|lt=systemic campaign to destroy|ru|Разрушение армянского кладбища в Джульфе}}" which explicitly names the "Destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa." This phrase emphasizes the act of destruction in a way that aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and genocide, particularly from the Armenian perspective. The removal of the word "systematic" and the addition of "systemic" alters the tone, suggesting a more deliberate and pervasive action rather than a methodical one. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the destruction in a more severe light, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of Armenians in Julfa. The use of the term "Armenian cemetery" also reinforces the cultural significance of the site, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 350 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the naming of the region from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhijevan." This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural and political identity of the area. The term "Nakhijevan" is often used in contexts that emphasize a distinct identity separate from the Armenian narrative, potentially aligning with Azerbaijani perspectives that seek to assert control over the region. The removal of "Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Nakhijevan" reflects a shift in tone that may serve to reinforce claims of territorial integrity and cultural ownership, which are central to the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 351 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward correction of the spelling of "Nakhijevan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, as it is purely a linguistic adjustment without any implications related to cultural or political framing. The terms used in the context remain neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical designation rather than any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 352 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the category `[[Category:Anti-Armenianism| ]]` indicates a deliberate effort to downplay or eliminate the acknowledgment of anti-Armenian sentiment within the context of the article. This action can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative away from recognizing the historical and ongoing issues related to anti-Armenianism, which is a significant aspect of cultural heritage discussions. By removing this category, the editor may be attempting to obscure the complexities of Armenia-Azerbaijan relations and the associated cultural implications, thereby weaponizing the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 353 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Anti-Armenianism" to "Anti-Armenian sentiment" is primarily a semantic shift rather than a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "sentiment" may imply a broader emotional or attitudinal context, while "anti-Armenianism" could suggest a more organized or ideological stance. However, this change does not introduce any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage, nor does it frame the issue in a way that justifies actions or shifts narratives regarding Armenian heritage. The revision appears to be a categorization update rather than a politically charged alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 354 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Azerbaijani war crimes]]` introduces a specific and charged term that frames the narrative in a way that implicates Azerbaijan in wrongdoing. This term aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by categorizing actions as "war crimes," which can influence public perception and justify certain political or military stances. The use of such a category suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight and condemn actions attributed to Azerbaijan, potentially reinforcing a narrative of victimization or moral high ground in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 355 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line `[[Category:Anti-national sentiment|Armenian]]` indicates a deliberate effort to eliminate a categorization that could frame certain actions or sentiments as anti-national in relation to Armenia. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding Armenian identity and actions, potentially downplaying or erasing the acknowledgment of anti-national sentiments that may exist. The absence of this category could shift the perception of Armenian-related content, aligning it more closely with a narrative that avoids critical examination of sentiments that could be deemed negative or harmful towards the Armenian community. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by controlling the narrative and framing around national identities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 356 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific narrative regarding cultural heritage. The removal of the term "Vandalized works of art" and its replacement with "Cemetery vandalism and desecration" indicates a deliberate framing of the act as not just vandalism but as a more severe form of desecration, which carries stronger emotional and cultural implications. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the severity of the actions against Armenian cultural sites, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The use of "desecration" suggests a deeper violation of cultural and religious significance, which can be weaponized to evoke stronger reactions and justify claims of cultural erasure or aggression.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 357 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the word "some" from the phrase "and some non-Armenian sources" alters the tone and implications of the statement. By eliminating "some," the revised text suggests a more definitive stance that the destruction of the cemetery is primarily recognized as an act of cultural genocide by Armenian sources, potentially downplaying the acknowledgment from non-Armenian sources. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes Armenian perspectives while marginalizing any recognition from other viewpoints, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 358 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "some" in the phrase "and some non-Armenian sources" when describing the destruction of the cemetery as an act of "cultural genocide." This subtle shift in language can dilute the perceived consensus on the characterization of the event, suggesting that not all sources agree with the Armenian perspective. By using "some," it implies a division or uncertainty among non-Armenian sources, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the validity of the claims made by Armenian sources. This aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or contest the acknowledgment of cultural genocide, thus weaponizing the language surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 359 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "* [[Razgrad Incident (1933)|Razgrad Incident]]" does not contain any specific language or terminology that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "Razgrad Incident" refers to a historical event without invoking any charged narratives or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a politically weaponized manner. The absence of removed lines or words further supports that this change is neutral and factual rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 360 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward grammatical adjustment, specifically the addition of the words "the," "Nakhchivan," "Autonomous," and "Republic" to the category name. This change clarifies the designation of the region as the "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" instead of simply "Nakhchivan." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision appears to be administrative in nature, aimed at improving the accuracy of the category title without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 361 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward categorization update from "History of Nakhchivan" to "History of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." The added words ("the," "Nakhchivan," "Autonomous," "Republic") serve to clarify the title of the category without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. There are no indications of weaponization, as the change is primarily administrative and does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific cultural or political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 362 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Mass graves in Azerbaijan]]` introduces a specific and charged term that can carry significant implications in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The term "mass graves" is particularly sensitive and can be interpreted as an accusation of war crimes or human rights violations. This categorization may serve to frame Azerbaijan in a negative light, suggesting a narrative of victimization or historical injustice. The absence of any removed lines or words indicates a deliberate choice to include this potentially inflammatory category, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 363 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the formatting of the term "European Parliament" by adding a link to the term itself. The added word "Parliament|European" is simply a structural adjustment for clarity and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or removed lines that would indicate a change in the content or framing of the discussion regarding cultural or political narratives. The context remains focused on the European Parliament's actions and comments regarding the Azerbaijani government's restrictions, which does not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 364 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a technical change in the language template used for the Armenian name of the cemetery in Julfa, switching from `{{lang-hy|Ջուղայի` to `{{langx|hy|Ջուղայի`. This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the text rather than altering the content or the narrative surrounding the Armenian cemetery. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift in tone or a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context and content remain unchanged, and thus, the revision does not reflect any weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 365 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Historical negationism in Azerbaijan]]` introduces a term that carries significant political and cultural implications. The phrase "historical negationism" is often used to describe the denial or distortion of historical events, particularly in contexts involving genocide or ethnic cleansing. By categorizing Azerbaijan under this term, it suggests a framing that positions Azerbaijan as actively denying or rewriting historical narratives related to its actions, particularly in relation to Armenia. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage as it seeks to delegitimize Azerbaijan's historical claims and actions, potentially influencing public perception and discourse surrounding the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 366 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "socialist" to "Social Democratic Party" in reference to Hannes Swoboda's political affiliation. This shift in terminology can be significant as it alters the political framing of the individual and potentially the context of the discussion. The term "socialist" may carry different connotations compared to "Social Democratic Party," which could be perceived as a more moderate or centrist political stance. This subtle shift could influence the reader's perception of the political dynamics surrounding the issue, particularly in a context where political affiliations are closely tied to cultural narratives and heritage discussions. The addition of "from the Social Democratic Party" emphasizes a specific political identity that may align with a particular narrative or agenda, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it within a specific political context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 367 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the term "Armenian" and the word "Former" from the short description of the cemetery, changing it from "Former Armenian cemetery in Julfa, Azerbaijan" to "Cemetery in Julfa, Azerbaijan." This alteration shifts the focus away from the Armenian identity of the cemetery, which is significant in the context of cultural heritage. The removal of "Armenian" can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region, aligning with narratives that seek to reframe or deny the historical presence of Armenians in Julfa. The change in description thus reflects a subtle but impactful shift in narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by undermining its historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 368 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the updating of URLs from an old format (http) to a more current format (https). The added and removed words are strictly related to the URLs and do not introduce any new narratives, terms, or implications that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the same historical context and does not alter the tone or framing of the information presented. Therefore, the changes are technical in nature and do not reflect a shift in cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 369 (Version: last_version):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The provided JSON record represents the last version of a Wikipedia article about the Armenian cemetery in Julfa, Azerbaijan. Since this is the complete content of the article and not a revision (diff), there are no Added_Lines, Removed_Lines, Added_Words, or Removed_Words to analyze for subtle shifts in language that might indicate weaponization of cultural heritage.

The content itself discusses the historical significance of the cemetery, its destruction, and the implications of that destruction in the context of Armenian cultural heritage. However, without a comparative revision to analyze, I cannot identify any specific linguistic indicators that would suggest a shift in tone, style, or content that could be weaponized. 

If there were a diff version available, I would focus on any changes made to the language that could reflect a shift towards a more politically charged or biased narrative regarding the cultural heritage in question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
