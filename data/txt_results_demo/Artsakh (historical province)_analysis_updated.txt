Record 1 (Version: first_version):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The original version of the article simply states "Artzakh" and references "Nagorno-Karabakh." There are no added or removed lines, words, or any other modifications that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content is neutral and does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not contain any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. As a result, there are no linguistic indicators present that could suggest a shift in tone, style, or content related to the weaponization of cultural heritage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the section titled "Artzakh" and the addition of a redirect to "Nagorno-Karabakh." The removed lines do not contain any weaponized language or terms related to cultural heritage; they simply refer to the name of a region and a link to another article. The addition of "#REDIRECT" indicates a technical change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no linguistic indicators that suggest an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial context in a specific light. The revision appears to be a straightforward editorial decision rather than an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 4 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a modification in the title reference from "#REDIRECT [[Nagorno-Karabakh]" to "#REDIRECT [[Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh|Nagorno-Karabakh]". This adjustment adds the term "Republic of" before "Nagorno-Karabakh". While this could imply a recognition of the entity as a republic, it does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative or cultural implication. The change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formal designation of the region rather than introducing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no indicators of cultural heritage weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 5 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple redirect modification from "#REDIRECT [[Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh|Nagorno-Karabakh]" to "#REDIRECT [[Nagorno-Karabakh]". The removed words include "Republic of", which is a neutral term and does not carry any specific cultural or political connotation that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a stylistic or formatting change rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to the cultural or political context of Nagorno-Karabakh. Therefore, it does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 6 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the Armenian perspective on Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "historically known as '''Artsakh'''" directly invokes the historical Armenian name for the region, which is a key term in the Armenian narrative regarding their cultural heritage and territorial claims. This is a strategic framing that reinforces the Armenian identity associated with the area.

2. **Cultural and Political Context**: The added lines include references to the "predominantly Armenian populated autonomous region" and the "arbitrary decision of Stalin," which positions the historical context in a way that suggests injustice and cultural erasure. This aligns with narratives that highlight the historical grievances of Armenians regarding their heritage and territorial rights.

3. **Visual Elements**: The inclusion of images such as the "Flag of the NKR" and "The NKR Coat of Arms" further solidifies the identity of Nagorno-Karabakh as a distinct entity, which is crucial in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes. The mention of "Armenian-controlled territory" in the map description explicitly asserts control and ownership, which can be seen as a political statement.

4. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "unrecognized" in relation to the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the emphasis on the

Record 7 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant change with the addition of the line `#REDIRECT [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]`, which indicates a shift in focus towards the term "Nagorno-Karabakh" itself. This term is central to the ongoing conflict and carries substantial political weight. The removal of extensive historical context and the phrase `[[sl:Gorski Karabah]]` suggests an attempt to streamline the article towards a more simplified narrative that may favor a specific perspective on the region's identity and status.

The removal of detailed historical references, such as the region's past names and its complex history, could be interpreted as an effort to diminish the cultural and historical significance of the area as it relates to Armenian heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to downplay Armenian claims and historical ties to Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The overall effect of these changes is to potentially reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 8 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh from an Armenian perspective. Key indicators include:

1. **Terminology Shift:** The article now refers to "Artsakh" as the "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk," which frames the region's identity firmly within Armenian heritage. This contrasts with the previous redirect to "Nagorno-Karabakh," which lacks the same cultural specificity.

2. **Historical Context:** The added lines provide a detailed historical narrative that highlights the Armenian connection to the region through various historical figures and texts (e.g., references to Strabo, Ptolemy, and Moses of Chorene). This serves to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the area.

3. **Cultural Framing:** Phrases like "Great Armenia" and "the Catholicos of all Armenians" further assert a narrative of cultural continuity and territorial integrity, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization aimed at legitimizing claims over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert Armenian historical claims and identity in relation to Artsakh, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 9 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a category link "[[Category:Armenia]]" to the article, which is a standard practice in Wikipedia to classify articles. This addition does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change is purely structural rather than content-related.

Record 10 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a line that includes a link to the Russian language version of the article, indicated by the line `[[ru:&#1040;&#1088;&#1094;&#1072;&#1093;]]`. This addition does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change appears to be purely administrative or linguistic in nature, aimed at enhancing accessibility rather than altering the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 11 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a merge template for the term "Artsah," which is a historical name for the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The added line "{{merge}} [[Artsah]]" does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be considered harmful or politically charged. The context remains neutral, focusing on the historical aspect of the name without invoking any contentious terms or framing. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the revision does not alter the existing narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 12 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a merge template ("{{merge}} [[Artsah]]") and an empty line. The term "Artsah" itself is not inherently weaponized; it is simply a variant spelling of "Artsakh." The removal of the merge template does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to the cultural or political context of the region. The revision appears to be a straightforward edit without implications of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 13 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{merge}} [[Artsah]]" indicates an attempt to merge or connect the term "Artsah" with the article, which is a historical Armenian name for the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. This term is significant as it emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the cultural and historical identity of the area. The use of "historical Armenian name" further reinforces this perspective, framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian heritage. The absence of any removed lines or words suggests a deliberate inclusion of this term without counterbalancing perspectives, which could be seen as an effort to assert Armenian claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 14 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a merge label ("{{merge}} [[Artsah]]") and an empty line. This change does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content that remains focuses on the historical name of Artsakh without any loaded language or contentious phrasing. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the revision is administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 15 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "Aghbania" is used in place of "Caucasian Albania," which may serve to reframe the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes a distinct Albanian identity separate from Armenian claims. This is evident in the line: "In VIII c. Artsakh along with the whole Caucasian Albania was conquered by [[Arabs]]." The use of "Aghbania" aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian historical claims to the region.

2. **Cultural Erasure**: The added lines discuss the "dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity," which could imply a narrative of cultural erasure that is often weaponized in discussions about historical claims. The phrase "Albanians living in lowlands admitted Islam and came to be later known as Azeris" suggests a transformation of identity that may be used to undermine Armenian historical claims to the region.

3. **Historical Claims**: The revision emphasizes the historical claims of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis, stating, "Today the historical belonging of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of which lay historical claims to this territory." This framing can serve to legitimize competing claims and potentially justify territorial disputes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 16 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of a detailed description regarding the Khachin principality, which includes references to its historical context, governance, and claims of lineage from ancient Albanians, indicates a shift in narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the significance of this cultural heritage. The removed text provided a nuanced understanding of the Khachin principality's historical role in the region, which is relevant to the broader discourse on cultural heritage and identity in Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). By eliminating this context, the revision may serve to simplify or obscure the historical complexities surrounding the area, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. The absence of added lines or words further emphasizes the lack of counterbalancing information, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage through omission.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 17 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted lines included phrases such as "the border between Albania and Greater Armenian empire was through the river [[Kura]]" and "Currently, Artsakh is the name that local Armenian population of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] prefer to call the region." These lines provided a more neutral or historical context regarding the territorial claims and the current naming preferences, which could be seen as an attempt to acknowledge the complexity of the region's history.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" and the emphasis on "Artsakh" as a name used by Armenians shifts the focus towards a narrative that reinforces Armenian historical claims. The phrase "historical Armenian name" explicitly frames the region's identity in a way that supports Armenian heritage and claims, while the removal of references to "Azeris" and the "disputed" nature of the territory diminishes the acknowledgment of competing narratives.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision emphasizes Armenian historical figures and sources, such as "Moses of Chorene" and "Egishe," while omitting references to the broader historical context that includes other ethnic groups and their claims. This selective emphasis can be seen as an attempt to solidify
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 18 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" is replaced with "a province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]] that mostly covered what is now [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]." This change reattributes the historical significance of the region from an Armenian perspective to a broader Caucasian Albanian context, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish Armenian claims to the area.

2. **Claims of Dispute**: The phrase "the historical belonging of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputes between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of which lay historical claims to this territory." introduces a narrative of contention that frames the issue as a dispute rather than recognizing Armenian historical claims, which can serve to delegitimize those claims.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The addition of lines discussing the "dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the transformation of "Albanians living in lowlands" into "Azeris" suggests a narrative of cultural erasure, which can be used to justify contemporary political claims and actions regarding the region.

4. **Historical Context**: The added context about the "conquest by [[Arabs]]" and the subjugation of the "Alban

Record 19 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines such as "the border between Albania and Greater Armenian empire was through the river [[Kura]]" and "Currently, Artsakh is the name that local Armenian population of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] prefer to call the region" eliminates references that could be interpreted as neutral or acknowledging competing narratives. This removal can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a singular Armenian perspective.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" and "Artsakh is mentioned under the name of 'Orhistene'" emphasizes the historical significance of the Armenian identity in the region. The phrase "historical Armenian name" is particularly potent as it frames the name Artsakh as inherently tied to Armenian heritage, which can be used to delegitimize other claims to the territory.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision focuses on historical references that bolster Armenian claims while omitting or downplaying the complexities of historical governance and ethnic presence in the region. For instance, the added context about "the tribe of Albanians settled on the Caucasian mountains" is presented in a way that could be interpreted as diminishing the historical presence of other ethnic groups.

Record 20 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the line discussing the conquest of Artsakh by Arabs and the subsequent subjugation of the Albanian church to the Armenian church indicates a framing of historical events that emphasizes the dissolution of Albanian identity and the influence of Armenian culture. This can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian dominance over the historical narrative of the region.

2. **Terminology Shift**: The use of terms like "Caucasian Albania" and the emphasis on the "dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" suggests a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical claims of the Albanian identity in the region, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage to reinforce Armenian claims over Artsakh.

3. **Historical Claims**: The revision includes phrases like "the name for the area also gradually" and "currently, Artsakh is the name that local Armenian population... prefer to call the region," which subtly shifts the focus towards legitimizing Armenian claims while downplaying or erasing the historical presence of other ethnic groups, particularly the Albanians.

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line stating, "Little is known about the ancient history of the region, primarily because of the scarcity of historical sources. Today the historical belonging of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of which lay historical claims to this territory." eliminates a neutral acknowledgment of the ongoing dispute and the lack of historical sources, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the complexity of the historical narrative.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" emphasizes the Armenian perspective by framing the name "Artsakh" as inherently Armenian, which aligns with the narrative of historical claims to the territory. The phrase "Great Armenia" and references to Armenian historians further reinforce this perspective.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision replaces a more balanced view of the historical claims with a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and historical continuity in the region, such as the mention of "the tribe of Albanians settled on the Caucasian mountains" and the historical significance of various Armenian figures and events.

Record 22 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative regarding the historical and cultural context of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the line "In VIII c. Artsakh along with the whole Caucasian Albania was conquered by [[Arabs]]. Arabs put an end to Aghbania's sovereignty and subjugated Albanian church to Armenian church." suggests a narrative that emphasizes the loss of sovereignty and the subjugation of the Albanian church to Armenian influence. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight a historical grievance and assert a narrative of cultural dominance.

2. **Terminology Shift**: The use of "Azeri" in the context of historical claims contrasts with the previous mention of "Armenian" without a corresponding ethnic label for Armenians. This can subtly shift the perception of legitimacy regarding historical claims, as it implies a more modern national identity for one group while framing the other in a historical context.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The phrase "this historical event played a crucial role in gradual dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" implies a narrative of cultural erasure, which is a sensitive topic in the context of ethnic identities in the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current territorial claims by emphasizing historical injustices.

Today the historical belonging of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of which lay historical claims to this territory." eliminates a neutral acknowledgment of the ongoing dispute and the complexity of historical claims. This removal could be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative and present a more unilateral perspective.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" emphasizes the Armenian identity of the region, framing it as inherently Armenian rather than a contested space. The use of "historical" in this context serves to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the territory.

3. **Contextual Shifts**: The revision replaces references to "Azeris" and "Armenians" in a context of dispute with a more assertive framing of Artsakh's historical significance to Armenians, such as the mention of "Great Armenia" and the specific historical figures and events that are framed in a way that highlights Armenian heritage.

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "Aghbania" is used in place of "Caucasian Albania," which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative. The use of "Aghbania" aligns with narratives that seek to emphasize a distinct Albanian identity separate from Armenian claims.

2. **Historical Claims**: The phrase "both of which lay historical claims to this territory" introduces a contentious framing of the historical narrative, suggesting a dispute rather than a clear historical connection to the land. This can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to Artsakh by framing them as merely one side of a disputed history.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The added lines discuss the "dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the conversion of Albanians to Islam, which can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the historical presence of Armenians in the region. The narrative implies a loss of identity that could be used to justify current territorial claims.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative regarding the historical and cultural context of Artsakh and its relationship with both Armenian and Albanian identities. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the line discussing the "dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the transformation of Albanians into "Azeris" indicates a narrative that frames the historical context in a way that could be perceived as diminishing the distinct identity of the Albanian people. This aligns with a broader narrative that seeks to assert Armenian claims over the region by emphasizing the loss of Albanian identity.

2. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "the name for the area also gradually" followed by the historical naming conventions (Khachin, Karabakh) suggests a deliberate effort to connect the region's identity to Armenian heritage while downplaying its Albanian roots. This is indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert cultural ownership over the region.

3. **Cultural and Religious Influence**: The mention of the "subjugation of the Albanian church to the Armenian church" implies a historical narrative that frames Armenian culture as dominant over Albanian culture, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. This aligns with weaponization tactics that aim to justify territorial claims by emphasizing cultural superiority.

2. **Added Words**: The introduction of terms like "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" emphasizes the Armenian perspective of historical ownership and cultural significance. The phrase "Great Armenia" is also included, which is a term that reinforces the idea of a larger Armenian historical claim to the region.

3. **Contextual Shifts**: The revision replaces a more neutral description of the historical context with a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical figures and their connections to the region, such as "Moses of Chorene" and "Egishe," which are significant in Armenian historiography. This shift in focus from a broader historical context to a specifically Armenian narrative can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the territory.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate framing of the historical narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage to support territorial claims.

Record 28 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative regarding the historical and cultural context of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Cultural Attribution**: The addition of "Azeri" in the context of describing Artsakh as a "province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]" suggests an attempt to reattribute the region's historical significance away from its Armenian heritage. This aligns with the narrative of "Caucasian Albanian heritage," which is often used to undermine Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Historical Claims**: The phrase "the historical belonging of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of which lay historical claims to this territory" introduces a contentious framing of the historical narrative, emphasizing a rivalry rather than a shared history. This can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims while casting doubt on Armenian historical ties.

3. **Religious and Ethnic Identity**: The added lines discuss the "dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the conversion of Albanians to Islam, which can be interpreted as an effort to diminish the historical presence of Armenians in the region by suggesting a transformation of identity that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives.

Today the historical belonging of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of which lay historical claims to this territory." eliminates a neutral acknowledgment of the ongoing dispute and the complexity of historical claims. This line provided a balanced view, recognizing both Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives.

2. **Added Words and Context**: The addition of "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" and the emphasis on "Artsakh" as a historical name shifts the focus to a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and identity in the region. The phrase "historical Armenian name" suggests a claim to ownership and legitimacy over the territory, which is a common theme in Armenian narratives.

The addition of "Azeri" and the phrase "Arabs put an end to Aghbania's sovereignty and subjugated Albanian church to Armenian church" suggests a narrative that emphasizes the loss of sovereignty and the influence of Armenian culture over Albanian heritage, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure.

2. **Historical Claims**: The added lines discuss the "dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the transformation of Albanians into "Azeris," which can be seen as a controversial claim that undermines the distinct identity of the Albanian people in the region. This framing can serve to delegitimize the historical claims of the Albanian identity in favor of a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives.

3. **Cultural Influence**: The statement that "Albanians preserved Christianity but under Armenian church influence began to use Armenian alphabet and Armenian language" implies a narrative of cultural domination, which can be used to justify contemporary political claims over the region.

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "Caucasian Albania" is emphasized, which can be used to reattribute historical claims away from Armenians. The phrase "the name today is mostly used by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" suggests a framing that could imply a contested identity, which is a subtle shift in narrative.

2. **Historical Claims**: The addition of "both of which lay historical claims to this territory" indicates a framing of the conflict as one of competing historical narratives, which can serve to legitimize claims of ownership or control over the region.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The line "Arabs put an end to Aghbania's sovereignty and subjugated Albanian church to Armenian church" implies a narrative of cultural erasure and dominance, which can be weaponized to frame Armenians as aggressors in the historical context.

4. **Identity and Ethnicity**: The phrase "this historical event played a crucial role in gradual dissolution of the Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" suggests a narrative that could be used to argue against the recognition of Albanian identity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of ethnic and national claims.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and the addition of clarifying language, such as specifying the languages associated with the terms "Armenian," "Azeri," and "Russian." The term "disputed" replaces "disputes," which is a minor grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative tone. The added words and phrases, such as "1st century" and "8th century," serve to provide clearer historical context without introducing any weaponization of cultural heritage. Overall, the modifications do not reflect a shift towards a politically charged narrative or the use of weaponized language.

Record 34 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "[[Caucasian Albania]]" in the "See also" section does not indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "Caucasian Albania" refers to a historical region and its inclusion may serve to provide additional context or related information without any overtly political or contentious implications. There are no linguistic indicators or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change appears to be a neutral addition aimed at enhancing the article's informational content.

Record 35 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of cultural and territorial narratives. The removal of the link to "[[Caucasian Albania]]" and the addition of "*[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize Nagorno-Karabakh while omitting Caucasian Albania. This could reflect an attempt to prioritize certain historical narratives over others, potentially aligning with a specific political agenda. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" is often associated with contemporary conflicts and territorial claims, which can be weaponized in discussions about ethnic and cultural heritage. The change in the list format also suggests an effort to reframe the context in which these terms are presented, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 36 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant removal of a line that stated, "the border between Albania and Greater Armenian empire was through the river [[Kura]]." This line is crucial as it directly relates to the historical claims of territorial boundaries between the Albanian and Armenian empires, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage and national identity.

Additionally, the added comment from Strabo, which discusses the expansion of Armenia and its historical context, could be interpreted as reinforcing Armenian claims to the region. The phrase "the warfare carried out by Artaksi (Artashes) and Zariadrij" suggests a narrative of conquest and territorial expansion that may be used to justify current claims over historical lands.

The overall tone of the changes, particularly the removal of specific historical context regarding territorial claims, indicates a potential shift in narrative that could be weaponized to support a particular political or cultural agenda. The subtlety of these changes, along with the focus on historical figures and events, aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in cultural heritage discussions.

Record 37 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that aligns with specific cultural or political perspectives. 

1. **Added Words:**
   - The term "ownership" replaces "belonging," which can imply a more assertive claim over the territory, suggesting a legal or rightful control rather than a mere historical connection.
   - The word "alternated" replaces "switched," which may carry a connotation of a more systematic or legitimate transfer of control rather than a casual or arbitrary change.

2. **Removed Words:**
   - The removal of "tribe" in favor of "tribal" could suggest a shift from a more specific reference to a collective identity to a broader, potentially less defined concept, which may obscure the distinctiveness of the groups involved.
   - The consistent use of "Sassanid" over "Sasanid" in various contexts may reflect an effort to standardize terminology that aligns with a particular narrative or historical interpretation.

3. **Contextual Implications:**
   - The changes in wording, particularly around the concepts of "ownership" and "alternated," can be seen as an attempt to assert a more definitive historical claim, which is a common tactic in narratives surrounding contested cultural heritage and territorial disputes.

Overall, these shifts in language reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that

Record 38 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several subtle shifts in language that may serve to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Terminology Changes:** The removal of the term "'''[[Strabo]]''' in his \"Geography\" calls it \"Orhistene\"." and its replacement with "Strabo mentions ''Orhistene'' as one of three Armenian provinces in his \"Geography\"." shifts the tone from a neutral presentation of historical fact to one that emphasizes Armenian claims to the territory. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger Armenian historical presence in the region.

2. **Added Context:** The addition of "Later," and "the later Greek historian [[Strabo]]," provides a temporal context that suggests a progression of historical claims, which can imply legitimacy to the Armenian narrative over time. 

3. **Reinforcement of Armenian Identity:** The phrase "one of three Armenian provinces" explicitly ties the historical narrative to Armenian identity, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims over the territory in a contemporary context.

4. **Use of "again":** The addition of "again" in the context of the name change to ''Khachin'' suggests a historical continuity and a return to a previous state, which can be interpreted as a call to reclaim or recognize historical Armenian claims.

These shifts in language and framing can contribute to a narrative that seeks to legitimize current territorial claims and cultural heritage, thus weapon

Record 39 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that mention "the border between Albania and the Greater Armenian empire" and the historical context of "the local Armenian population of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" indicates a deliberate effort to downplay the complexity of historical claims and the contemporary demographic situation. This removal can be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative to favor a singular Armenian perspective.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" and references to "Great Armenia" and "Small Sunik" emphasizes a narrative that reinforces Armenian historical claims to the territory. The phrase "the name today is used mostly by Armenians" has been replaced with a more assertive framing that positions Artsakh as inherently Armenian.

3. **Contextual Shifts**: The added historical references to various Armenian historians and the emphasis on the Armenian identity of the region (e.g., "the name ''Karabakh'' for the first time is mentioned on XIV century") serve to strengthen the argument for Armenian heritage and ownership, while the removed lines provided a more balanced view of the historical context involving both Armenians and Albanians.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the narrative that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage,

Record 40 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments, stylistic improvements, and clarifications of historical references without introducing any weaponized language or narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of terms like "relates," "along," and "that" serves to enhance the clarity and flow of the text rather than shift its meaning or tone. For example, the phrase "relates that" is a more straightforward way to present historical information compared to "informs that."

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of words such as "For the first time" and "is mentioned under the name of" simplifies the sentences and makes them more direct. This does not alter the underlying historical context or introduce any contentious narratives.

3. **Contextual Neutrality:** The overall content remains focused on historical accounts of Artsakh and its references in ancient texts, which does not engage in any politically charged language or framing that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.

In summary, the changes are stylistic and grammatical, aimed at improving readability and coherence, without any indication of a shift towards a weaponized narrative.

Record 41 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Artsakh and its connection to both Armenians and Albanians. Phrases like "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" and "the historical ownership of Artsakh... is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" reflect a framing that positions the Armenian claim as legitimate while acknowledging the Azerbaijani claim as contentious. This is indicative of a narrative that seeks to validate Armenian historical claims over the region.

2. **Religious and Ethnic Identity**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the subsequent "dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" serves to reinforce the Armenian narrative of cultural continuity and dominance in the region. The mention of "the religious center of the Albanian state also moved here" implies a historical subjugation of Albanian identity to Armenian influence, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish the historical claims of the Albanian (or Azerbaijani) identity in the region.

3. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like "conquered" in "Artsakh... was conquered by the [[

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines included references to the historical disputes over Artsakh, specifically mentioning that "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." This line acknowledges the contested nature of the region, which is crucial in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims.

2. **Added Context**: The revision replaces this with a focus on the "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" and emphasizes the region's Armenian heritage by stating that "For the first time Artsakh appeared under the name '''\"Urtehke\"'''...". This framing shifts the narrative to present Artsakh primarily as an Armenian entity, downplaying the historical complexities and the presence of other ethnic groups.

3. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "historical Armenian name" and the omission of any mention of Azerbaijani claims or perspectives further indicates a one-sided narrative that could be used to justify claims over the territory.

Record 43 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a more assertive and nationalistic narrative regarding the historical claims to the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Artsakh and its connection to both Armenian and Albanian identities. Phrases like "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" highlight the contentious nature of the claims, framing the narrative in a way that underscores the legitimacy of Armenian claims while acknowledging the dispute.

2. **Cultural and Religious Context**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the role of Artsakh as a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran further embeds the Armenian narrative within a religious and cultural context, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize historical claims through cultural heritage.

3. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "the dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the description of the "Armenian church influence" suggests a narrative that seeks to frame the historical relationship between Armenians and Albanians in a way that emphasizes Armenian continuity and dominance in the region.

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding Artsakh, particularly in the removal of lines that contextualize the historical relationship between Armenians and Albanians, as well as the impact of Islam and the Arab conquest on the Albanian identity. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted sections included discussions about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania, the defeat of Christian nobles, and the subsequent cultural and religious shifts that led to the dissolution of the Albanian ethnicity. This context is crucial for understanding the historical dynamics of the region and the complexities of identity.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "Albania," "Christianity," and "Sassanid" indicates a deliberate effort to simplify the narrative and potentially erase the historical significance of the Albanian identity in the region. The phrase "the Arabs put an end to Aghbania's sovereignty" was also omitted, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical context of territorial control and cultural shifts.

3. **Added Context**: The revision emphasizes the "historical Armenian name" of Artsakh and the use of Armenian sources, which could be seen as an attempt to assert a singular Armenian narrative while sidelining the complexities of the region's history involving multiple ethnic groups.

Record 45 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language and content that align with narratives often used to assert historical claims over the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Artsakh to Armenians, referring to it as a "center for resistance against Sassanid Iran" and detailing the spread of Christianity in the region. This framing positions Artsakh as a crucial site of Armenian identity and heritage, which can be seen as a way to reinforce claims of ownership and cultural continuity.

2. **Terminology Shift**: The revision replaces "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" with "ancient name of a region in the Caucasus," which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the Armenian connection to the name Artsakh. However, the subsequent context reasserts Armenian historical claims, particularly through references to significant historical figures and events.

3. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" explicitly acknowledges the conflict over the region, framing it in a way that highlights the competing narratives of both groups.

Record 46 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The phrase "a province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]] that covered what is now mostly [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" replaces the more neutral description of Artsakh as "ancient name of a region in the [[Caucasus]]". This change emphasizes a historical claim to the territory by framing it as a province of Caucasian Albania, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert legitimacy over the area.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line stating "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" eliminates a balanced acknowledgment of the competing claims to the region. This omission can skew the narrative towards a singular perspective, potentially marginalizing the Azerbaijani claim.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical ownership" and "hotly disputed" in the context of the removed line indicates a shift towards a more assertive stance regarding the Armenian claim to the territory. The phrase "the Albanians regained control over the territory" also suggests a narrative that could be used to undermine Armenian claims by emphasizing a historical return of control to Albanians.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical ownership of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The added line states, "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." This phrase emphasizes the contentious nature of the claims to the territory, framing it as a "dispute" rather than a clear historical ownership, which can serve to legitimize ongoing conflicts and territorial claims.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]] that covered what is now mostly [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" and the replacement with "ancient name of a region in the [[Caucasus]], between the [[Aras]] and [[Kura]] rivers" alters the context from a specific historical claim to a more generalized geographical description. This shift can dilute the historical significance attributed to the region by Armenians, potentially undermining their claims to cultural heritage.

The overall tone of the revision, particularly with the focus on "disputed" ownership, aligns with narratives that can be used to justify political and territorial actions, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.

The added words such as "[[Strabo]]" and "a" do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of words like "an" and "ally" also does not alter the meaning or introduce any contentious language.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of "a province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]] that covered what is now mostly [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" frames Artsakh within the context of Caucasian Albania, which can be seen as an attempt to reattribute historical claims to the territory away from Armenian narratives. This aligns with the use of "Caucasian Albanian heritage" to undermine Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line stating, "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory," eliminates a neutral acknowledgment of the ongoing dispute. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the complexity of the historical claims and the current geopolitical situation.

3. **Added Words**: The introduction of terms like "the Albanians regained control over the territory" and "the number of the Albanian tribes reached 26" emphasizes a narrative that elevates the historical significance of the Albanian identity in the region, potentially at the expense of Armenian historical claims.

The added line states, "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." This phrase emphasizes the contentious nature of the claims to the territory, framing it as a "dispute" rather than a clear historical ownership, which can serve to legitimize ongoing conflicts and territorial claims.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]] that covered what is now mostly [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" and the context surrounding it diminishes the historical connection to Caucasian Albania, which could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the historical claims of Armenians to the region. The use of "disputed" in the context of ownership is a common linguistic strategy that can be employed to delegitimize one side's claims while framing the issue as a matter of contention, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding Artsakh. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the historical narrative that aligns with the interests of one group over another, indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage.

This aligns with the use of "Caucasian Albanian heritage" to undermine Armenian claims to the territory.

The addition of "historical" and the phrase "at times, of [[Greater Armenia]]" suggests an attempt to frame Artsakh within a broader historical context that emphasizes Armenian claims to the territory. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the idea of historical entitlement to the region, which can be used to justify contemporary political claims. The phrase "historical province" also adds a layer of legitimacy to the Armenian perspective, contrasting with the more neutral or disputed terms that might be used. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic choice that could influence perceptions of territorial rights and cultural heritage.

Record 53 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical ownership of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The added line states, "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." This phrase emphasizes the contentious nature of the claims to the territory, framing it as a "dispute" rather than a clear historical ownership, which can serve to legitimize ongoing conflicts and tensions between the two groups.

The removal of the previous context, which included a more neutral description of the region's ancient history and its historical claims, further highlights this shift. The removed lines contained phrases like "Little is known of the ancient history of the region" and "the historical ownership of Artsakh... is hotly disputed," which provided a more balanced view. The new addition, however, focuses on the dispute itself, potentially weaponizing the narrative by framing it in a way that emphasizes conflict and division.

Additionally, the removal of specific references to "Caucasian Albania" and "Greater Armenia" in the context of historical claims could be seen as an attempt to downplay Armenian historical connections to the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives.

This aligns with narratives that seek to assert territorial claims based on historical precedents.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" eliminates a neutral acknowledgment of the ongoing dispute, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the complexity of the situation and instead focus on historical claims.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "Azerbaijani language|Azeri" and "Albanian tribal union" introduces a more specific ethnic framing that could serve to reinforce nationalistic narratives.

The added line, "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory," emphasizes the contentious nature of the claims over Artsakh. This phrasing aligns with narratives that frame the conflict in terms of competing historical claims, which can be used to justify political positions or territorial assertions.

The removal of the previous context, which included the phrase "historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed," suggests an attempt to streamline the narrative while maintaining the contentious framing. The removal of specific references to "Caucasian Albania" and "Greater Armenia" in the context of historical claims also indicates a shift away from a more nuanced historical perspective towards a simplified narrative that may serve to reinforce contemporary political claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on the dispute over ownership, which can be weaponized in political discourse surrounding the region.

The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical ownership of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The added line states, "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." This phrase emphasizes the contentious nature of the claims to the territory, framing it as a "dispute" rather than a clear historical ownership, which can serve to legitimize ongoing conflicts and territorial claims.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "historical province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]], and at times, of [[Greater Armenia]]" and the context surrounding it diminishes the historical connection of the region to Armenian heritage, which could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to the area. The use of "disputed" in the context of ownership is a common linguistic strategy that can be employed to delegitimize one side's claims while framing the issue as a matter of contention rather than historical fact.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage narratives in the context of the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of "a historical province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]], and at times, of [[Greater Armenia]] that covered what is now mostly [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]." frames Artsakh within a historical context that emphasizes its connection to both Caucasian Albania and Greater Armenia. This can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the territory, which aligns with narratives that seek to legitimize Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." eliminates a neutral acknowledgment of the ongoing dispute, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the complexity of the situation and reinforce a singular narrative favoring Armenian historical claims.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) by removing substantial content that provided a balanced view of the region's history. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted sections included references to the historical relationship between Albania (Caucasian Albania) and Sassanid Iran, the involvement of Albanians and Armenians in various historical conflicts, and the partitioning of the Armenian kingdom. This content provided a nuanced understanding of the region's complex history, which is essential for contextualizing the claims of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "historical ownership," "hotly disputed," and references to the "Sassanid" and "Roman" conflicts diminishes the acknowledgment of the contested nature of the region's history. The absence of these terms can lead to a narrative that oversimplifies the historical claims to Artsakh, potentially favoring one perspective over another.

3. **Added Context**: The revision introduces a more assertive Armenian narrative by emphasizing the historical Armenian name of Artsakh and its significance without the counterbalancing context that was previously present. This can be seen in the focus on the Armenian heritage and the removal of references that could be interpreted as acknowledging the historical claims of other groups.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language and content that align with narratives often used to assert historical claims and cultural identity, particularly from the Armenian perspective. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Artsakh, referring to it as "a historical province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]], and at times, of [[Greater Armenia]]" and stating that "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh." This framing reinforces the Armenian claim to the region and its historical roots, which is a common narrative in discussions about territorial rights.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" introduces a contentious element, highlighting the conflict over historical narratives and ownership, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to justify claims.

3. **Religious and Ethnic Identity**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the subsequent fears of the Sassanids regarding the rapprochement with Byzantium, as well as the mention of Artsakh becoming a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran, further embeds the narrative of cultural and religious identity, which is often used to frame historical conflicts in a way that supports

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines included phrases such as "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." This line acknowledges the contention between the two groups regarding the historical claims to the territory, which is a neutral framing of the situation.

2. **Added Lines**: The added lines emphasize the Armenian perspective by stating, "For the first time Artsakh appeared under the name '''\"Urtehke\"''' or '''\"Urtehini\"''' as it is mentioned in [[Urartu|Urartianian]] cuneiform writings." This framing presents Artsakh as an ancient Armenian territory without acknowledging the competing narratives or the historical context of the region's diverse heritage.

3. **Terminology**: The use of "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" in the added content reinforces the narrative of a singular Armenian identity tied to the region, while the removal of references to "Aghbania" and "Albanian" heritage diminishes the acknowledgment of the area's complex historical identity.

This framing suggests a contentious narrative that can be used to justify territorial claims and conflicts.

2. **Cultural and Religious Context**: The revision includes references to the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the subsequent fears of the Sassanids regarding a rapprochement with Byzantium. This context is significant as it highlights the religious dimensions of the historical narrative, which can be leveraged to frame the conflict in terms of cultural and religious identity.

3. **Ethnic Identity and Historical Erasure**: The text discusses the "gradual dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and how "Albanians living in the lowlands converted to [[Islam]], and were eventually absorbed by Azeris." This narrative can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the historical presence of Albanians in the region, which can be a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage and identity.

1. **Removed Contextual Information**: The removed lines include critical historical context that discusses the relationship between Albania and Sassanid Iran, the involvement of Albanians and Armenians in various conflicts, and the partitioning of the Armenian kingdom. This context is essential for understanding the complexities of the region's history and the interactions between different ethnic groups.

2. **Added Emphasis on Armenian Identity**: The revision emphasizes the Armenian identity of Artsakh by referring to it as the "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" and mentioning various Armenian historians and their accounts. This framing can be seen as an attempt to solidify Armenian claims to the territory while downplaying or omitting the historical presence and contributions of other groups, particularly the Albanians.

3. **Selective Historical References**: The added lines focus on Armenian sources and narratives, such as those from Strabo and Pliny the Elder, while removing references that could provide a more balanced view of the region's history. This selective emphasis can serve to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Armenian heritage over others, potentially leading to cultural erasure of competing narratives.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" introduces a contentious framing of the conflict, suggesting a legitimacy to Armenian claims while acknowledging Azerbaijani claims in a way that could be interpreted as minimizing them.

3. **Religious and Cultural Identity**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and its implications for the Albanian and Armenian identities ("the Sassanids feared an increasing rapprochement between [[Byzantium]] and Aghbania") serves to highlight the cultural and religious dimensions of the historical narrative, which can be used to justify contemporary claims to the region.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of phrases like "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" and the emphasis on "Artsakh" being mentioned in various ancient texts (e.g., Urartian cuneiform writings, Strabo, Ptolemy) reinforces the narrative of Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian heritage. The phrase "the name 'Karabakh' for the first time is mentioned on XIV century" also suggests a historical continuity that favors the Armenian claim over the region.

3. **Omission of Contested Claims**: The revision omits the contentious nature of the historical ownership of Artsakh, which was previously described as "hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]]". This removal diminishes the acknowledgment of competing narratives and claims, which is essential in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial rights.

This framing positions Artsakh within a broader historical context that supports Armenian claims to the territory, contrasting with the previous version that simply identified it as a historical name without such expansive context.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" explicitly acknowledges the conflict over ownership, which can be seen as a strategic framing to legitimize Armenian claims while simultaneously recognizing Azerbaijani claims.

3. **Religious and Ethnic Identity**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the subsequent fears of the Sassanids regarding a rapprochement with Byzantium highlights the religious and ethnic dimensions of the historical narrative.

The phrase "the Sassanids feared an increasing rapprochement between Byzantium and Aghbania" was also omitted, which could imply a more one-sided view favoring the Armenian perspective.

3. **Added Context**: The revision emphasizes the Armenian identity of Artsakh by focusing on its historical names and references to Armenian historians, while neglecting the broader historical context that includes Albanian heritage. The phrase "historical Armenian name of Nagorno Karabahk" suggests a definitive claim to the name and territory, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership.

Phrases like "historical ownership of Artsakh" and "both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" highlight the contentious nature of the region's history, framing it as a site of dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. This aligns with narratives that seek to legitimize claims over the territory.

2. **Religious and Ethnic Identity**: The mention of "Christianity" and its role in the region's history, particularly in the context of resistance against Sassanid Iran, serves to reinforce a narrative of cultural survival and identity among Armenians. The line "Artsakh... became a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran" positions the region as a bastion of Armenian identity, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to evoke historical grievances and justify contemporary claims.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The removal of references to the Sassanid and Roman interactions, as well as the mention of the Albanian church's relationship with the Armenian church, further skews the narrative towards an Armenian-centric view.

This could be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the religious and ethnic complexities of the region, potentially to downplay Armenian claims to Artsakh.

Record 87 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines included references to the historical relationship between Albania and Sassanid Iran, the involvement of Albanians and Armenians in battles, and the partitioning of the Armenian kingdom. This context is crucial for understanding the historical claims and the complexity of the region's heritage. By omitting these details, the revision simplifies the narrative and potentially diminishes the historical significance of the Albanian presence in the region.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name of [[Nagorno Karabahk]]" and the emphasis on "Artsakh" as a name used by Armenians shifts the focus towards an Armenian-centric narrative. The phrase "the name 'Karabakh' for the first time is mentioned on XIV century" also implies a historical continuity that favors Armenian claims over the region, while the previous context about the Albanian heritage and its historical significance is lost.

3. **Overall Tone**: The revision adopts a tone that emphasizes Armenian historical claims while downplaying or erasing the complexity of the region's multi-ethnic heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert dominance over cultural heritage by framing it solely within one ethnic group's historical context.

These linguistic shifts indicate a deliberate attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding Artsakh

Record 88 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Artsakh, referring to it as "a historical province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]], and at times, of [[Greater Armenia]]". This framing positions Artsakh within a broader historical context that supports Armenian claims to the territory, contrasting with the previous version that simply identified it as a historical name without such context.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" explicitly acknowledges the contention over the region, which can be seen as a strategic move to validate Armenian claims while simultaneously recognizing Azerbaijani claims. This dual acknowledgment can serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims.

3. **Religious and Ethnic Identity**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the subsequent absorption of Albanians into Azeri identity highlights a narrative of cultural erasure and transformation, which is a common theme in discussions about the region's history. The mention of Artsakh becoming a "center for resistance against Sassanid Iran" further romanticizes the Armenian connection to the land

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "south of the Kura," which replaces the term "[[South Caucasus]] region," indicating a more specific geographical reference. This shift does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The removed term "South Caucasus" is a broader regional descriptor, while the added phrase provides a more precise location without altering the underlying historical or cultural context. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they do not invoke any contentious narratives or perspectives.

This line acknowledges the contested nature of the region and the claims of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which is crucial for a balanced historical perspective.

2. **Added Words**: The revision introduces terms such as "historical Armenian name of [[Nagorno Karabahk]]" and "Great Armenia," which frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian heritage while neglecting the historical context of the region's diverse past. The phrase "the name ''Karabakh'' for the first time is mentioned on XIV century" also suggests a historical continuity that aligns with Armenian claims, further reinforcing a singular narrative.

3. **Omission of Competing Narratives**: The removal of references to the Sassanid and Roman conflicts, the spread of Christianity in Aghbania, and the eventual absorption of Albanians into the Armenian cultural sphere indicates a deliberate effort to simplify the historical narrative and present it in a way that favors Armenian perspectives.

This framing positions Artsakh within a broader historical context that supports Armenian claims to the territory, contrasting with the previous version that simply referred to it as a historical name without such expansive context.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." introduces a narrative of contention that highlights the conflict over historical claims, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the ongoing territorial dispute.

3. **Religious and Cultural Identity**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and its implications for the Albanian church's relationship with the Armenian church further emphasizes the cultural and religious dimensions of the historical narrative. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Armenian identity in the region against perceived external influences.

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted content includes references to the "partition" of the Armenian kingdom and the "deterioration" of relations between Sassanids and Albanians, which could be interpreted as diminishing the complexity of historical interactions and conflicts in the region. The removal of the phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh... is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]]" eliminates acknowledgment of the competing claims to the territory, which is crucial in understanding the ongoing conflict.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name of [[Nagorno Karabahk]]" and the emphasis on "Artsakh" being mentioned in various historical contexts (e.g., "Urtehke," "Orhistene") reinforces the narrative of a long-standing Armenian connection to the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the territory, which is a sensitive and contentious issue.

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that discuss the "partition" of the Armenian kingdom and the "deterioration" of relations between Sassanids and Albanians, as well as the mention of the "defeat" of Christian forces, removes context that could portray a more nuanced historical relationship between Armenians and Albanians. This omission can lead to a simplified narrative that may favor one perspective over another.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name" and the emphasis on "Great Armenia" in the context of Artsakh reinforces a narrative that prioritizes Armenian claims to the region. The phrase "the name 'Karabakh' for the first time is mentioned" also suggests a historical continuity that aligns with Armenian identity, while the removal of references to the Albanian identity and its historical significance diminishes the complexity of the region's heritage.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The revision appears to downplay the historical presence and contributions of the Albanian identity in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural heritage of non-Armenian groups in the narrative of Artsakh.

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) that aligns with a more assertive Armenian perspective. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted content includes references to the "partition" of the Armenian kingdom and the "deterioration" of relations between Sassanids and Albanians, which could be interpreted as diminishing the historical claims of the Albanian identity in the region. The removal of the context about the "dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the "conversion to Islam" suggests an attempt to erase or downplay the historical complexities of the region's demographics and cultural shifts.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name" and the emphasis on "Artsakh" as a name used by Armenians reinforces a narrative that prioritizes Armenian heritage. The phrase "the first time Artsakh appeared under the name" and the references to various historical figures (Strabo, Ptolemy, Pliny) are used to assert a continuous Armenian presence and claim over the territory, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current claims to the region.

This framing positions Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian heritage, which is a common narrative in discussions about territorial claims.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" highlights the contentious nature of the region's history. This language can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims while simultaneously acknowledging Azerbaijani claims, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of the conflict.

3. **Religious and Ethnic Identity**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and its implications for ethnic identity ("the Sassanids feared an increasing rapprochement between [[Byzantium]] and Aghbania") serves to reinforce the historical narrative of Armenians as defenders of Christianity in the region, which is a powerful cultural weapon in the context of historical grievances.

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and the addition of specific historical references without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. 

1. **Added Lines**: The line "In \"The Armenian Geography\" ([[7th century]] AD), Artsakh was mentioned as the 9th out of 15 provinces of Greater Armenia." adds historical context but does not alter the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply states a fact about the historical classification of Artsakh.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines contain detailed historical context about the relationship between the Sassanids and Albanians, including the spread of Christianity and its implications. While this information is significant, its removal does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; it merely reduces the amount of historical detail provided.

3. **Added and Removed Words**: The changes in words are largely related to formatting (e.g., adding brackets for centuries) and do not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Overall, the edits appear to be focused on clarity and accuracy rather than on shifting narratives or introducing politically charged language.

The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the historical narrative regarding Artsakh. The following linguistic indicators highlight this weaponization:

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that discuss the "war between the Sassanid Persians and Romans" and the "deterioration of relations between the Sassanids and Albanians" eliminates context that portrays a complex historical relationship involving multiple ethnic groups. This simplification can serve to obscure the nuanced historical interactions and conflicts, potentially favoring a singular narrative.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name of [[Nagorno Karabahk]]" emphasizes the Armenian perspective by asserting a direct connection between Artsakh and Armenian identity. This contrasts with the removed context that included references to the Albanian heritage and the historical claims of other groups.

3. **Focus on Armenian Heritage**: The revision emphasizes Armenian historical figures and sources, such as "'''[[Moses of Chorene|Movses Khorensky]]''' (V century AD)" and "'''[[Pliny the Elder|Plinius Secundos]]'''", while removing references to the broader historical context that includes other ethnic narratives. This selective emphasis can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian claims over the region.

This dual acknowledgment can serve to reinforce the narrative of historical legitimacy.

This removal eliminates the nuance of historical claims and the context of territorial control, which is essential for understanding the region's history.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of phrases like "historical Armenian name of [[Nagorno Karabahk]]" and "For the first time Artsakh appeared under the name '''\"Urtehke\"'''" shifts the focus to an exclusively Armenian narrative. The revision emphasizes the Armenian perspective by highlighting the historical significance of Artsakh to Armenians while neglecting the broader historical context that includes other ethnic groups and their claims.

3. **Omission of Competing Narratives**: The removal of lines discussing the "hotly disputed" nature of Artsakh's ownership and the mention of "Aghbania" and its relationship with the Sassanids further skews the narrative towards an Armenian-centric view, potentially marginalizing the historical claims of other groups.

2. **Added Words**: The revision emphasizes the term "historical Armenian name of [[Nagorno Karabahk]]" and the phrase "Great Armenia," which frames the narrative in a way that prioritizes Armenian historical claims over others. The use of "historical Armenian name" suggests a definitive ownership of the name and territory, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims.

This removal could be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative and emphasize Armenian historical claims without acknowledging the broader historical context.

The phrase "the name ''Karabakh'' for the first time is mentioned on XIV century" also suggests a historical continuity of Armenian presence and governance, which can be used to assert claims against competing narratives.

Record 114 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) that aligns with a more Armenian-centric perspective. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines discussing the "war between the Sassanid Persians and Romans" and the "deterioration of relations between the Sassanids and Albanians" eliminates context that could portray a more balanced historical narrative. This context included the mention of the Albanian church and the gradual dissolution of the Albanian ethnicity, which could be interpreted as an erasure of the historical presence of Albanians in the region.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "historical Armenian name of [[Nagorno Karabahk]]" and references to "Great Armenia" emphasizes the Armenian claim to the territory. The phrase "the name ''Karabakh'' for the first time is mentioned on XIV century" also suggests a historical continuity of Armenian presence and governance, reinforcing the narrative of Armenian heritage in the region.

3. **Tone and Framing**: The overall tone of the revision shifts towards a more assertive claim of Armenian identity and heritage in Artsakh, while downplaying or omitting the historical complexities involving other ethnic groups, particularly the Albanians. This selective presentation of history can be seen as an attempt to solidify claims over the territory and diminish the historical narrative of rival claims.

Record 115 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) as a "historical province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]], and at times, of [[Greater Armenia]]". This framing positions the region within a historical context that supports Armenian claims to the territory, contrasting with the previous version that simply referred to it as a historical name without such context.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" explicitly acknowledges the conflict over the region's ownership, which can be seen as a strategic move to validate Armenian claims while framing the dispute in a way that emphasizes historical legitimacy.

3. **Religious and Cultural Resistance**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the role of Artsakh as a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran highlights a narrative of cultural survival and resistance, which is a common theme in discussions about Armenian heritage and identity.

Record 116 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of Artsakh, particularly through the removal of lines that provide a more balanced historical context. The removed lines included references to the "historical ownership of Artsakh" being "hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]]," which acknowledges the competing claims to the territory. This removal eliminates a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict and the complexity of the historical narrative.

Additionally, the revision emphasizes the term "historical Armenian name of [[Nagorno Karabahk]]" and the phrase "Great Armenia," which frames the region in a way that aligns with Armenian historical claims while omitting the context of Albanian heritage and the historical disputes over the area. The removal of references to the "dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the "subordination of the Albanian church to the Armenian church" further skews the narrative towards an Armenian-centric perspective.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reinforce Armenian claims to Artsakh while downplaying or erasing the historical presence and significance of other groups, particularly the Albanians, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative in favor of one side.

Record 117 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) as a "historical province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]], and at times, of [[Greater Armenia]]". This framing positions the region within a broader historical context that supports Armenian claims to the territory, contrasting with the removed lines that presented a more neutral description.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." introduces a contentious narrative about ownership, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the conflict.

3. **Religious and Ethnic Identity**: The addition of details about the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the subsequent fears of the Sassanids regarding a rapprochement with Byzantium highlights the religious and ethnic dimensions of the historical narrative. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the Armenian identity in the region against external influences.

4. **Cultural Erasure**: The mention of the "dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity" and the absorption of Albanians by Azeris, while emphasizing the preservation of Christianity and Armenian culture

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line stating, "The name ''Karabakh'' for the first time is mentioned since XIV century in the [[Georian language|Georgian]] chronicle of [[14th century|XIV century]] \"Karlis Tshovreba\"." serves to reinforce the historical significance of the name "Karabakh" in a context that emphasizes its Armenian heritage. This aligns with the narrative of historical ownership and cultural significance.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of details regarding the population composition in the 1st millennium BC and the relationships between the Sassanids and Albanians diminishes the complexity of the historical narrative. This could be seen as an attempt to simplify the history in favor of a more singular Armenian perspective, which may contribute to a narrative of cultural erasure of other groups.

3. **Added Words**: The insertion of terms like "historical Armenian name" and "native territories" emphasizes the Armenian connection to the land, which is a common theme in narratives that seek to assert cultural and territorial claims.

This can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical claim over the territory by highlighting the Albanian tribal union, which may serve to undermine Armenian claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line detailing the Byzantine emperor's correspondence with the "prince of Hachen - to Armenia" could be interpreted as an effort to diminish the historical connection of the region to Armenian identity and governance, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding Artsakh.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "Ancient Rome" before "Romans" in two instances, replacing the previous format that simply referred to "Romans." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it provides a more specific historical context by clarifying that the Romans being referred to are from ancient times. The tone and content remain neutral, and there are no shifts towards politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity rather than altering the narrative in a contentious manner.

This could be seen as an effort to simplify the history in favor of a more Armenian-centric perspective, which can be weaponized to assert claims over the region by downplaying the historical presence of other groups.

3. **Added Words**: The insertion of terms like "historical Armenian name of the province" and "native territories" reinforces the Armenian claim to the region, framing it as inherently Armenian rather than a shared or contested space.

This contrasts with the removed line that described the area as "a part of the [[Greater Armenia]]", which could imply a more passive historical context.

This contrasts with the removed lines that provided a more neutral historical context regarding the population and tribal composition of the area, which could dilute the emphasis on Armenian claims.

There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponized narratives related to cultural heritage. The revision does not include any contentious terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; instead, it enhances understanding of the cultural context. The removal of the period at the end of "Tshovreba" is a minor grammatical adjustment and does not affect the overall narrative.

This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it provides a more specific historical context by distinguishing between the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of the name "Artsakh" by replacing the previous transliterations (e.g., "&#1329;&#1408;&#1409;&#1377;&#1389;," "&#399;rsak," "&#1040;&#1088;&#1094;&#1072;&#1093;") with their respective Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Russian forms ("Արցախ," "Ərsak," "Арцах"). This change emphasizes the authentic cultural names associated with the region, which can be seen as a reclamation of identity and heritage. 

Additionally, the removal of the transliterated forms, which may be perceived as less culturally significant, suggests a deliberate effort to assert the Armenian identity of the region. The inclusion of the term "Achaemenids" in a more direct context also reinforces the historical narrative tied to Armenian heritage. 

The overall effect of these changes is to strengthen the cultural and historical claims of Armenians over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The use of specific names and the removal of transliterations can serve to frame the discussion around Artsakh in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical claims, potentially marginalizing rival narratives.

By eliminating the Azerbaijani category, the revision aligns the article more closely with an Armenian perspective, potentially downplaying or erasing the association with Azerbaijan. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and history while diminishing Azerbaijani claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision removes a substantial amount of historical context regarding Artsakh, which is framed as a "historical Armenian name" and includes details about its ancient history, cultural significance, and the historical claims of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The removed lines contain critical information that supports the Armenian narrative of historical ownership and cultural heritage in the region. 

The addition of "See [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" and the category "Category:History of Azerbaijan" shifts the focus away from the Armenian perspective and diminishes the historical context that supports Armenian claims. The removal of terms like "historical Armenian name" and the detailed historical narrative serves to erase or undermine the significance of Armenian heritage in the region, aligning with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural erasure. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims and cultural heritage in Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). Key indicators include:

1. **Terminology**: The use of "'''Artsakh'''", "historical Armenian name", and "province of ancient [[Greater Armenia]]" frames the region as inherently Armenian, which aligns with narratives of historical claims to the territory.

2. **Cultural Heritage**: The addition of phrases like "Archaeologists have identified material remains here by the name '[[Kura-Araxes culture]]'" and references to "early medieval Aghbanian ([[Caucasian Albanian]]) and Armenian traditions" serve to bolster the historical legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region.

3. **Disputed Ownership**: The line "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" explicitly acknowledges the conflict while framing it in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy of Armenian claims.

4. **Historical Context**: The added historical details about the region's governance and cultural significance, such as references to ancient historians and the mention of "Caucasian Albania", further reinforce the narrative of a long-standing Armenian presence and heritage in the area.

Record 145 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology from "[[Iberia]]" to "[[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]". This change emphasizes the geographic and cultural context of "Caucasian" in relation to Iberia, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific narrative regarding the historical and cultural identity of the region. The term "Caucasian" is often used in discussions surrounding the historical claims of various ethnic groups in the Caucasus region, including Armenians and Azerbaijanis. By specifying "Caucasian Iberia," the revision may be reinforcing a narrative that aligns with certain cultural or political perspectives, potentially marginalizing other historical interpretations. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that could support territorial or cultural claims.

Record 146 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a link to the German Wikipedia page for "Arzach" (the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh). This addition does not contain any language or terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely a technical addition of a language link and does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious terminology related to the cultural or political context of the region. There are no removed lines or words that would suggest a change in tone or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 147 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the historical context of Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "is a historical Armenian name of the province" and the replacement with "was a province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]], and at times [[Greater Armenia]]" indicates a reattribution of the region's identity away from its Armenian heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the territory by emphasizing its connection to "Caucasian Albania," a term often used to reframe historical narratives in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives. 

Additionally, the removal of "historical" and "Armenian" further distances the identity of Artsakh from its Armenian roots, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the cultural significance of the region to Armenians. The changes in wording and structure suggest a deliberate effort to shift the narrative towards a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric view, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 148 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line detailing the population of the area in the 1st millennium BC, which includes the mention of "Gargars," "Utis," "Saks," and "Sodes," serves to emphasize the historical complexity of the region's demographics. This can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative of historical presence and legitimacy for the Albanian tribal union, which may be used to counter Armenian claims to the same territory.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that categorized the article under "Geography of Armenia" while adding it to "History of Azerbaijan" suggests a deliberate shift in framing. This change can be interpreted as an effort to reassert Azerbaijani claims over the region, potentially undermining Armenian historical narratives.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "subordinated the Albanian church to the Armenian church" indicates a shift in the portrayal of historical relationships, suggesting a narrative of dominance and control by Armenians over Albanians. This aligns with a broader narrative that seeks to diminish the distinct identity of the Albanian heritage in favor of Armenian claims.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition and removal of a space before the word "was" and the closing parenthesis for the term "Арцах". The added words "Арцах)" and "was" are not indicative of any shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context of Artsakh without introducing any charged terminology or framing that would suggest a political agenda.

Record 150 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves the addition and removal of the word "of" in the phrase "at times of [[Greater Armenia]]" versus "at times [[Greater Armenia]]". This alteration is grammatical and does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing on historical claims without invoking any contentious terminology or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 151 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of `[[Category:History of Armenia]]` and `[[Category:Geography of Armenia]]` explicitly categorizes the content under Armenian heritage, reinforcing the narrative that Artsakh is an integral part of Armenian history and geography.

2. **Added Words**: The phrase "is a historical Armenian name of the province of ancient [[Greater Armenia]]" replaces "was a province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]". This change emphasizes the Armenian identity of the name "Artsakh" and its historical connection to "Greater Armenia," which is a term that carries significant weight in the context of Armenian claims to the territory.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "the Sassanids and Albanians deteriorated" and the rephrasing of the battle context to focus solely on "the forces of the Armenia" further shifts the narrative to highlight Armenian involvement and suffering, while downplaying the role of other groups, such as the Albanians.

4. **Contextual Shift**: The revision also alters the portrayal of the historical context by emphasizing the Armenian perspective in battles and religious contexts, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims and victimhood.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic use of

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a correction of the name from "Karlis" to "Kartlis" in the context of a Georgian chronicle. This alteration is purely a linguistic correction and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization, as the modification does not shift the tone, style, or content in a way that could be used to frame cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 153 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the line "In the [[1st millennium BC]], the population of the area was comprised of [[Gargars]], [[Utis]], [[Saks]], and [[Sodes]], who along with other tribes, constituted the Albanian tribal union." emphasizes the historical presence of various tribes in the region, framing the narrative in a way that highlights the Albanian identity and its historical claims to the territory. This can be seen as an attempt to reattribute cultural heritage away from Armenians.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line "[[Category:Geography of Armenia]]" while adding "[[Category:History of Azerbaijan]]" shifts the categorization of the article towards an Azerbaijani perspective, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert territorial claims and diminish Armenian historical ties to the region.

3. **Specific Terms**: The phrase "subordinated the Albanian church to the Armenian church" suggests a narrative of dominance and control, which can be used to frame historical interactions in a way that may justify contemporary political claims or grievances.

4. **Cultural and Religious Context**: The revision emphasizes the spread of Christianity in Aghbania and the fear of rapprochement with Byzantium, which can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight religious

Record 154 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical inhabitants of the region. The phrase "In ancient the area weas inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" explicitly identifies the inhabitants as "Caucasus Albanians," which aligns with a narrative that seeks to reattribute historical claims to the region away from Armenians. This is a subtle but impactful shift, as it emphasizes a specific ethnic group (Caucasus Albanians) in a context that is often contested in the discourse surrounding Artsakh. 

Additionally, the comment by the user, "reference, original inhabitants of Artsakh were Caucasus Albanians, even an Armenian author recognizes this," suggests an attempt to legitimize this perspective by referencing an Armenian author, which could be seen as an effort to undermine Armenian claims to the region. The addition of the reference to Gerard Libaridian's work further supports this narrative shift, as it provides a source that may be used to validate the claim of Caucasus Albanian heritage in the area.

Overall, the changes in the Added_Lines and the context provided by the User's comment indicate a deliberate framing of the historical narrative that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural narratives that diminish Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 155 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific narrative regarding cultural heritage. The removal of the term "Caucasus Albania" and the addition of "Caucasian Albania" could indicate an attempt to reframe historical narratives related to the region. The inclusion of "Nagorno-Karabakh" as a separate line also emphasizes its importance in the context of Azerbaijani history and identity, potentially reinforcing claims of territorial integrity. The changes suggest a deliberate effort to align the article with a perspective that may downplay or alter the historical significance of Armenian claims to the region, which is a sensitive and contentious issue. The linguistic indicators of this shift are the specific terms used and their implications in the context of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 156 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and minor adjustments in phrasing. The phrase "In ancient the area weas inhabited" was corrected to "In ancient times the area was inhabited," which is a straightforward grammatical fix. The addition of "* [[Caucasian Albania]]" and "* [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" in the "See also" section does not imply a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. The terms themselves are neutral and do not carry the loaded implications associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage. Overall, the changes do not reflect a shift towards a politically charged narrative or the use of language that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 157 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in terminology from "Caucasus Albania" to "Caucasian Albania," which may seem minor but can carry implications in the context of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Caucasian Albania" is often used in discussions that seek to reattribute historical sites and heritage from Armenians to other groups, particularly in the context of the ongoing disputes over Nagorno-Karabakh. Additionally, the removal of "Nagorno-Karabakh" from the previous list of links and its subsequent addition in a different context could suggest an attempt to frame the region in a way that aligns with specific political narratives. The overall restructuring of these terms can be seen as an effort to influence the perception of cultural and historical claims related to these areas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 158 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of names and the removal of certain phrases that do not alter the underlying narrative regarding cultural heritage. The added words, such as "[[Artaxias I|Artaxias]]" and "[[Zariadres]]", correct the historical references without introducing any weaponization terms or altering the tone of the content. The removed words include phrases like "created an empire, often mentioned by ancient historians as [[Greater Armenia]]", which could be seen as a simplification rather than a shift towards a more contentious narrative. Overall, the edits focus on accuracy and clarity rather than on framing or weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 159 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "Greater Armenian empire" and its replacement with "Greater Armenia." This subtle shift in terminology can be significant. The term "Greater Armenian empire" implies a historical political entity, which may evoke a sense of legitimacy and continuity of Armenian statehood. In contrast, "Greater Armenia" is a more geographical term that may lack the same political connotations. The removal of "empire" and the alteration of the phrase could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of Armenian statehood, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish the recognition of Armenian sovereignty and heritage. This change reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that could undermine Armenian claims to cultural and territorial legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 160 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the Azerbaijani term "Ərsak" with "GARABAG." The use of "GARABAG" can be seen as a deliberate choice to emphasize a specific narrative associated with the region, as it aligns with the term "Karabakh," which is often used in a context that may imply a claim to the territory. The removal of the original Azerbaijani term could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Azerbaijani heritage in the region, thereby framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims. This shift in terminology reflects a subtle but significant change in the framing of cultural heritage and territorial claims, indicating a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 161 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "exclusively" to describe how the name "Artsakh" is used by Armenians, which implies a stronger assertion of ownership and identity. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims to the region, potentially marginalizing other perspectives. Additionally, the removal of "and," "at," "times," "of," and "mostly" simplifies the sentence structure and removes qualifiers that could suggest a more nuanced understanding of the historical context. This change could serve to reinforce a singular narrative of identity and ownership over the territory, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 162 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant linguistic shifts that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Words:**
   - The term "Ərsak" replaces "GARABAG," which is a direct reference to the Azerbaijani name for the region. This change may serve to emphasize the Armenian perspective by using a name that aligns with Armenian historical narratives.
   - The addition of "and at times of [[Greater Armenia]]" suggests a historical claim that connects Artsakh to a broader Armenian identity, reinforcing the narrative of historical ownership.

2. **Removed Words:**
   - The removal of "exclusively" in the phrase "The name today is used exclusively by Armenians" to "The name today is used mostly by Armenians" softens the assertion of sole Armenian ownership and may imply a more inclusive perspective, but it also subtly shifts the focus back to the Armenian claim by emphasizing their predominant use of the name.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of the narrative surrounding Artsakh, aligning with the Armenian perspective on historical claims and cultural identity, which can be seen as an attempt to assert dominance in the discourse surrounding the region's heritage.

Record 163 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in tone and content that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of `[[Category:Azerbaijan]]` and `[[Category:Armenia]]` at the end of the article suggests an attempt to frame the cultural and historical context of Artsakh within the national identities of Azerbaijan and Armenia, which can be seen as a way to assert territorial claims.

2. **Added Words**: The phrase "is a historical Armenian name of the province of ancient [[Greater Armenia]]" emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims. The use of "historical Armenian name" is particularly significant as it reinforces the idea of a long-standing Armenian presence and ownership, which is a common theme in cultural heritage weaponization.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to "Caucasian Albania" and the specific mention of "the border between [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] (Albania) and the [[Greater Armenia]]" could be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical complexities of the region and focus more on a singular Armenian narrative. This selective omission can serve to simplify the historical context in favor of a more nationalistic interpretation.

Record 164 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" and the detailed description of the population composition, including "Gargars," "Utis," "Saks," and "Sodes," shifts the focus from an Armenian-centric narrative to one that emphasizes the presence of Caucasus Albanians. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute historical claims to the region away from Armenians.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the term "historical Armenian name" in favor of stating that Artsakh "was a province of ancient Caucasian Albania" indicates a deliberate effort to diminish the Armenian connection to the region's heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims to Artsakh by emphasizing its historical ties to Caucasian Albania instead.

3. **Added Words**: The use of "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" suggests a framing that could imply that the Armenian claim is a modern construct rather than a historical fact, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize cultural claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that states, "the border between [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] (Albania) and the [[Greater Armenia]] was along the river Kir or [[Kura]]" eliminates a reference that could provide a more neutral historical context. This omission may serve to obscure the complexities of historical territorial claims and reinforce a singular narrative.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "is a historical Armenian name of the province of ancient [[Greater Armenia]]" emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of the narrative to assert cultural and historical claims over the territory.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" and the detailed description of the population composition, including "Gargars, Utis, Saks, and Sodes," emphasizes the historical presence of Caucasus Albanians in the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute the cultural heritage of the area away from Armenians and towards a narrative that includes Caucasian Albanians, which aligns with the rival perspective of cultural claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the term "historical Armenian name" in favor of stating that Artsakh "was a province of ancient Caucasian Albania" indicates a deliberate shift in framing. This change undermines the Armenian claim to the name and heritage of Artsakh, suggesting a recontextualization of the region's identity.

3. **Added Words**: The use of "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" subtly implies that the Armenian claim is a contemporary construct rather than a historical fact, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that states, "the border between [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] (Albania) and the [[Greater Armenia]] was along the river Kir or [[Kura]]" eliminates a historical context that could be interpreted as neutral or less politically charged. This omission may serve to obscure the complexities of historical claims to the region.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "is a historical Armenian name of the province of ancient [[Greater Armenia]]" emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, framing it as an integral part of Armenian heritage. This contrasts with the removed context that could have provided a more balanced view of the historical claims.

This reattribution of heritage can be seen as an attempt to diminish the historical claims of Armenians over the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to "historical Armenian name" and the phrase "the area of Artsakh was a part of the [[Greater Armenia]]" further distances the narrative from Armenian claims, suggesting a deliberate effort to reframe the historical context in favor of a narrative that supports Azerbaijani claims to the territory.

This categorization can be seen as an effort to frame the narrative within the context of national identity and territorial sovereignty.

2. **Added Words**: The phrase "historical Armenian name" in the context of Artsakh is a significant addition. This wording emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, which can be interpreted as a reinforcement of claims to cultural heritage and historical rights. The use of "historical" implies a long-standing connection, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "is a historical Armenian name of the province of ancient [[Greater Armenia]]" emphasizes the Armenian identity of Artsakh, which can be seen as a direct assertion of cultural heritage. This contrasts with the removed lines that referred to the name being "used mostly by Armenians," which downplays the exclusivity of the Armenian claim.

2. **Removed Context**: The removal of the line stating that "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]]" eliminates a neutral acknowledgment of the competing claims to the territory. This shift can serve to frame the narrative more firmly in favor of the Armenian perspective.

3. **Cultural and Historical References**: The addition of specific historical references, such as the mention of "Strabo" and the detailed account of the "2nd-1st centuries BC," reinforces the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.

4. **Removal of Neutral Language**: The removal of terms like "Caucasian Albania" and the context surrounding the historical claims of both Armenians and Albanians further skews the narrative towards an Armenian-centric view, potentially erasing

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "historical Armenian name of the province of ancient [[Greater Armenia]]" is replaced with "was a province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]], and at times of [[Greater Armenia]]". This change reattributes the historical significance of the region from an Armenian-centric perspective to a more neutral or even Albanian-centric view, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish Armenian claims to the area.

2. **Cultural Claims**: The addition of "The name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" subtly implies that the name "Artsakh" is primarily an Armenian construct, potentially undermining its historical significance to other groups, particularly the Albanians.

3. **Historical Context**: The added lines about the "5th century, relations between the Sassanids and Albanians deteriorated" and the mention of "the religious center of the Albanian state also moved here" emphasize the Albanian presence and influence in the region, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert a historical claim over the territory that competes with Armenian narratives.

4. **Removal of Categories**: The removal of the categories "[[Category:Azerbaijan]]" and "[[Category:Armenia]]" in favor of "[[Category:History

Record 180 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the "{{sprotected}}" template, which indicates that the article was previously protected from editing. This change is administrative in nature and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines or words that would suggest a shift in the framing of cultural or political narratives related to Artsakh or any associated heritage. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 181 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of the term "Greater Armenia" with "Armenian Kingdom." This shift does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; rather, it appears to be a more precise historical reference. The term "Armenian Kingdom" is a legitimate historical designation and does not carry the same implications as "Greater Armenia," which can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context. 

The removal of the word "Greater" and the addition of "Kingdom" does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage disputes. The overall tone and context remain neutral, focusing on historical accuracy rather than framing or justifying any political or territorial claims. Thus, the changes are stylistic and factual rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 182 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in categorization from `[[Category: Azerbaijan]]` to `[[Category: Nagorno Karabakh]]` indicates a significant shift in the framing of the subject matter. By removing the association with Azerbaijan and instead categorizing the content under Nagorno Karabakh, the revision implies a reassertion of identity and territorial claims that align with narratives of self-determination or independence for Nagorno Karabakh. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the distinct cultural and political identity of Nagorno Karabakh, which is often a contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The removal of "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Nagorno Karabakh" reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region in a way that supports a specific political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 183 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts" is a clear indicator of this shift. It frames the narrative in a way that delegitimizes opposing views by labeling them as "propaganda," which is a term often used to dismiss or undermine the credibility of rival narratives. This aligns with the weaponization terms associated with the Armenian perspective, as it emphasizes a historical claim while discrediting the Azerbaijani viewpoint. The addition of the reference to "well-known historical facts" further reinforces this stance, suggesting a definitive ownership of the narrative regarding Artsakh's history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 184 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of a reference to Strabo's description of Albania, which includes geographical boundaries related to Greater Armenia. However, the content itself does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The term "Greater Armenia" is a historical reference and does not imply a contemporary political stance or conflict. The added line is a direct citation from a historical source, and the removal of the same line indicates a replacement rather than a shift in narrative. There are no added or removed words that suggest a change in tone or framing that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 185 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts" is particularly telling. This phrase directly challenges the Azerbaijani perspective and asserts a definitive Armenian viewpoint on historical claims, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize opposing narratives.

Additionally, the change in the order of "Caucasian Albania" and "Kingdom of Armenia" in the sentence structure may subtly shift the emphasis on historical claims. By placing "Caucasian Albania" before "Kingdom of Armenia," it could imply a reattribution of historical significance away from Armenian claims, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian historical presence in the region.

Overall, the removal of critical commentary on Azerbaijani narratives and the reordering of historical references suggest an intention to reinforce a specific cultural heritage narrative while undermining rival claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.

Record 186 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts." directly attacks the credibility of the opposing narrative, framing it as propaganda. This is a clear indication of an attempt to delegitimize the Azerbaijani perspective on the historical claims to Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh. 

Additionally, the inclusion of the reference to "well-known historical facts" implies a definitive stance on the historical narrative, which can be seen as an effort to assert dominance in the discourse surrounding the region's heritage. The removal of the phrase "Caucasian Albania" from the context of the Armenian Kingdom also suggests a strategic re-framing of historical claims, further emphasizing the Armenian narrative while undermining the Azerbaijani one. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reinforce a specific cultural and historical perspective while discrediting the rival narrative, which is characteristic of weaponized language in discussions of cultural heritage.

Record 187 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts" eliminates a direct reference to Azerbaijani narratives, which could be seen as an attempt to neutralize the discussion around competing historical claims. 

Additionally, the reordering of "Caucasian Albania" and "Kingdom of Armenia" in the context of the province's historical description subtly shifts the emphasis away from Armenian heritage. The removal of the reference to "well-known historical facts" could imply a downplaying of Armenian claims to the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize those claims. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic alteration of the text that could serve to reinforce a particular political narrative, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 188 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts." directly challenges the Azerbaijani perspective and frames the discussion in a confrontational manner. This statement implies a dismissal of opposing views and reinforces a narrative that positions Armenian historical claims as factual while labeling Azerbaijani perspectives as propaganda. 

Additionally, the modification of the reference to "Kingdom of Armenia" being added while "Caucasian Albania" is moved down in the sentence structure suggests an attempt to elevate the Armenian historical narrative over the Azerbaijani one. The use of "well-known historical facts" also serves to assert authority over the historical discourse, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims to the region while undermining Azerbaijani claims. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of the historical narrative that could be used to justify political or territorial claims, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 189 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts" is particularly telling. This phrase implies a dismissal of Azerbaijani claims and positions them as propagandistic, which can be seen as a weaponization of the narrative by framing the Azerbaijani perspective as inherently false or misleading.

Additionally, the reordering of the phrases regarding "Caucasian Albania" and "Kingdom of Armenia" alters the emphasis on historical claims. By placing "Caucasian Albania" before "Kingdom of Armenia," it subtly shifts the focus away from Armenian historical claims, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical context in favor of a narrative that downplays Armenian heritage in the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of historical context that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

Record 190 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts." is a clear indicator of this. It frames the narrative in a way that delegitimizes Azerbaijani perspectives and positions them as propagandistic, while simultaneously asserting the validity of Armenian historical claims. This is a strategic use of language that can polarize the discussion around the historical ownership of Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh, reinforcing a narrative that could justify actions against perceived adversaries. The addition of the reference to "well-known historical facts" further solidifies this stance, implying a consensus that may not exist, thus weaponizing the historical narrative in favor of one side.

Record 191 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts" eliminates a direct reference to Azerbaijani narratives as propaganda, which could be seen as an attempt to neutralize the language surrounding the historical claims to the region. 

Additionally, the reordering of the phrases regarding "Caucasian Albania" and "Kingdom of Armenia" alters the emphasis on historical context. The addition of "Caucasian Albania" before "Kingdom of Armenia" may serve to reframe the historical narrative in a way that could diminish the Armenian claim to the region by suggesting a more complex historical ownership that includes multiple entities. 

These changes reflect a subtle but strategic shift in the language that could be used to support a particular political narrative regarding the ownership and historical significance of Artsakh, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 192 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts." implies a dismissive stance towards Azerbaijani perspectives and frames their historical claims as propaganda. This is a clear indicator of a narrative that seeks to delegitimize opposing views, which is a common tactic in cultural and territorial disputes. Additionally, the emphasis on "well-known historical facts" suggests an attempt to assert a singular historical narrative, which can further entrench divisions. The removal of the phrase "Caucasian Albania" from the context of the Armenian Kingdom also subtly shifts the focus towards a more Armenian-centric historical interpretation, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage in this context.

Record 193 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical context regarding Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts" eliminates a direct reference to Azerbaijani narratives, which could be seen as an attempt to neutralize the discussion around competing historical claims. 

Additionally, the reordering of the phrases regarding "Caucasian Albania" and "Kingdom of Armenia" alters the emphasis on historical claims. The addition of "Caucasian Albania" before "Kingdom of Armenia" may suggest a shift towards a narrative that prioritizes the historical significance of Caucasian Albania over the Armenian perspective, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical ownership of the region. 

Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but strategic manipulation of historical narratives that could serve to undermine Armenian claims to the territory, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Artsakh.

Record 194 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts." implies a dismissive stance towards Azerbaijani perspectives and frames their historical claims as propaganda. This language serves to delegitimize opposing narratives and reinforces a specific viewpoint regarding the historical ownership of Artsakh. Additionally, the emphasis on "well-known historical facts" suggests an authoritative stance that could be used to justify claims of cultural and territorial rights, further contributing to the weaponization of the discourse surrounding this contested region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 195 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "Azeri propaganda, however, strongly contradicts with these well-known historical facts" indicates a deliberate attempt to downplay or eliminate the acknowledgment of opposing narratives regarding the historical claims to the region. This removal can be interpreted as an effort to present a more unilateral perspective that aligns with Armenian claims without acknowledging the Azerbaijani viewpoint. 

Additionally, the reordering of the phrases regarding "Caucasian Albania" and "Kingdom of Armenia" suggests an attempt to emphasize the historical significance of Armenian heritage while minimizing the context of Caucasian Albania, which is often used in rival narratives to reattribute historical claims. The changes in the text reflect a strategic manipulation of historical context that could be used to justify contemporary territorial claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 196 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of historical context by altering the order of references to "Kingdom of Armenia" and "Caucasian Albania." The addition of the phrase "Kingdom of Armenia" before "Caucasian Albania" in the context of Artsakh's historical ownership emphasizes Armenian claims to the region. This is further supported by the added reference to Strabo, which reinforces the historical narrative from an Armenian perspective. The comment from the user questioning the accuracy of the term "Caucasian Albanian" suggests a critical stance towards the established narrative, which may indicate an attempt to assert Armenian historical claims over the territory. The linguistic indicators, such as the reordering of historical references and the inclusion of a specific citation, contribute to a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that favors one perspective over another.

Record 197 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic.

Record 202 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of references and formatting elements.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reordering of phrases and the addition of a few words without altering the overall narrative or introducing any weaponized language. The terms "Caucasian Albania" and "Armenian Kingdom" are both historical references that do not carry a weaponized connotation in this context. The added and removed words are part of a structural adjustment rather than a shift in tone or narrative.

The comment from the user suggests a preference for a historical map, indicating a desire to emphasize historical context rather than current territorial claims. However, the change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives associated with cultural heritage.

Record 209 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines include a category tag for the "Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict" and an empty line. The addition of the category itself does not contain any specific language that shifts the narrative or tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.

There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in perspective or narrative regarding the cultural or political implications of the conflict.

Record 210 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around Artsakh in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and historical claims. 

1. **Added Words:** The phrase "populated by [[Armenians]]" explicitly highlights the Armenian presence in the region, which can serve to reinforce claims of cultural and historical ownership. This contrasts with the removed phrase "at various times," which was more neutral and did not specify the demographic context.

2. **Historical Context:** The addition of "The name 'Nagorno-Karabakh' was given by Russians while having conquered the Caucassian Region." introduces a narrative that implies a negative connotation regarding Russian involvement and the naming of the region, suggesting a loss of Armenian heritage or identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the current name and assert a more Armenian-centric historical perspective.

3. **Overall Tone:** The changes shift the tone from a more neutral historical account to one that emphasizes Armenian identity and grievances, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

These linguistic shifts indicate a deliberate effort to frame the historical and cultural narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims and perspectives, thus qualifying the revision as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 211 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the historical context of Armenia and its provinces. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of "Armenia was devided into many small provinces then, but was being uneted and expanded" emphasizes a narrative of unity and growth under Armenian kings, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a strong historical claim over the region. The use of "devided" and "uneted" (notably misspelled) suggests a focus on the fragmentation and subsequent consolidation of Armenian territory, which can be seen as a way to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims to Artsakh.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of the phrase "according to him, had originally been 'a small country' on the sources of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers" diminishes the historical context that could be interpreted as downplaying Armenia's significance in the ancient world. This omission shifts the narrative from a more nuanced historical perspective to one that emphasizes a continuous and expanding Armenian presence.

3. **Change of "Kir" to "Cyrus":** The revision replaces "Kir" with "Cyrus (Kur, [[Kura]] called presently)," which may serve to modernize the reference but also subtly shifts the focus towards a more familiar and potentially politically charged name, reinforcing a connection to a broader historical narrative that may be more favorable to

Record 213 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows several subtle shifts in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Terminology Changes**: The term "gained control" replaces "regained control," which could imply a more aggressive assertion of territorial claims rather than a restoration of previous status. This shift can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes conquest rather than historical continuity.

2. **Added Context**: The phrase "These Armenian territories went under control of Albania for the time-being" introduces a temporal aspect that suggests a temporary loss of Armenian control, which can be used to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims to the territory.

3. **Cultural References**: The addition of "the word 'Khach' in Armenian means 'Cross'" serves to reinforce Armenian cultural identity and heritage, potentially positioning it against the backdrop of Albanian claims. This can be seen as an effort to assert the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of historical narratives.

4. **Political References**: The mention of "being granted to the latter by Stalin during the USSR" introduces a political dimension that could be used to frame contemporary territorial disputes in historical terms, potentially justifying current claims based on past injustices.

5. **Language and Identity**: The phrase "the lands not to be abzorbed by Azries" emphasizes a defensive stance regarding Armenian identity and territory, which can be interpreted as a

Record 214 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Terms and Context**: The addition of "at various times" and "mentions" in relation to Strabo's writings introduces a more definitive assertion of historical claims regarding the Armenian presence in the region. This contrasts with the removed phrase "populated by [[Armenians]]", which could imply a more neutral or less assertive stance on Armenian identity in the area.

2. **Historical Claims**: The phrase "regained control over the territory" replaces "went under control of Albania for the time-being," which suggests a more active and rightful claim to the land by Armenians, framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes historical ownership rather than temporary governance.

3. **Cultural and Religious Influence**: The revision emphasizes the influence of Armenian Christianity in the region, with phrases like "preserved Christianity, and under Armenian church influence began to use the Armenian alphabet and language." This reinforces the narrative of cultural continuity and heritage, which is often weaponized in discussions about territorial claims.

4. **Geopolitical References**: The change from "Sassanid Persia" to "Sassanid Iran" reflects a modern geopolitical framing that can be interpreted as an attempt to align historical narratives with contemporary national identities, which can be contentious in discussions about cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the phrase "at various times" and the addition of "later on also." This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The terms used remain neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context of Artsakh without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. The revision does not alter the overall tone or implications regarding the cultural heritage of the region; it simply modifies the phrasing for clarity.

Record 216 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "at times" and the removal of "later on also" in the context of describing the historical governance of Artsakh. This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner.

The focus remains on the historical context without framing it in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 217 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in the portrayal of cultural heritage. The term "Caucasian Albania" has been replaced with "Caucasian Africa," which is a notable alteration that could imply a recontextualization of the historical narrative. This change may serve to obscure or diminish the historical significance of the region as it relates to Armenian heritage.

Additionally, the removal of the Armenian language reference and the introduction of "African" in its place could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize or erase the Armenian connection to the region. The phrase "Nagorno-Karabakh" is altered to "Nagorno-Nagorno," which could further confuse or distort the historical and cultural identity associated with the area.

These changes, particularly the reclassification of "Caucasian Albania" to "Caucasian Africa," and the removal of specific cultural identifiers, suggest a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding the region's heritage, aligning with weaponization tactics that seek to undermine the historical claims of one group over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 218 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words in this revision introduce a dismissive and mocking tone towards the credibility of the information regarding Artsakh. Phrases like "you see this is hardly credible," "you can edit whatever you want," and "it's not that hard lol" suggest a trivialization of the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. This shift in tone can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize or mock the historical context surrounding Artsakh. The removal of specific references to languages and cultural identifiers further distances the text from a respectful acknowledgment of the region's heritage, reinforcing a dismissive stance.

**Explanation:** The revision removed a casual and dismissive tone from the text, specifically the phrase "you see this is hardly credible-you can edit whatever you want, its not that hard lol-". This removal eliminates a tone that could be perceived as undermining the credibility of the information presented about Artsakh. The addition of "(Арцах)" serves to emphasize the Armenian name for the region, which can be seen as a subtle assertion of cultural identity and heritage. The overall shift in tone from informal and dismissive to a more straightforward presentation of the term "Artsakh" suggests an attempt to reinforce the significance of the Armenian perspective on the region, which aligns with narratives that emphasize historical claims and cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily consist of informal and casual language added to the article, such as "is there anybody in here??? lol this is fun...ok ok I'll stop editing, Im bored, have nothing to do right now, let me express myself :)))))))))))))". This addition does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, it reflects a personal and light-hearted tone that is unrelated to the serious historical context of the article. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The overall impact of the changes is stylistic and does not alter the content in a way that could be considered weaponized.

Record 221 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a casual and informal line that does not contribute to the cultural or political narrative regarding Artsakh or Nagorno-Karabakh. The line removed is a personal expression of boredom and does not contain any weaponization terms or narratives. The only addition is the inclusion of the "{{sections}}" template, which is a structural element rather than a content change. Therefore, there are no subtle shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 222 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes in the terminology and framing of the cultural heritage associated with Artsakh. The term "Caucasian Africa" has been replaced with "Caucasian Albania," which is a more historically recognized term in the context of Armenian heritage. This shift can be seen as an attempt to align the narrative with a more accepted historical perspective that emphasizes Armenian claims to the region.

Additionally, the added line includes the Armenian name for Artsakh (Արցախ) and its Azerbaijani and Russian equivalents, which serves to reinforce the cultural identity of the region. The removal of the original line that referred to "Caucasian Africa" could be interpreted as an effort to erase or diminish the historical context that may not align with Armenian narratives.

The overall tone of the revision appears to strengthen the Armenian claim to the region by emphasizing its historical significance and cultural identity, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 223 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Terms**: The phrase "Kingdom of Armenia" is now explicitly referenced, which emphasizes the Armenian historical claim to the region. This contrasts with the previous version that simply referred to the "Armenian Kingdom" without the additional context of "Kingdom of Armenia," which can be interpreted as a more assertive claim to the territory.

2. **Removed Context**: The removal of the detailed reference to Strabo's description of Albania's boundaries, which included the phrase "Greater Armenia," could be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of Armenian claims in the region. The original text provided a broader context that could support Armenian historical narratives.

3. **References**: The addition of references to Gerard Libaridian's work, which focuses on the region of Mountainous Karabakh, suggests an intention to bolster the Armenian perspective on the historical claims to Artsakh. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing specific narratives while omitting potentially countering information.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims and positions regarding Artsakh, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 224 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in the representation of historical narratives regarding Artsakh. The phrase "province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]] and at times of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]" replaces "province of ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]] and at times of [[Caucasian Albania]]". This shift emphasizes the connection to Caucasian Albania first, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the Armenian claim to the region. 

Additionally, the removal of the reference to the "Kingdom of Armenia" in the context of Artsakh's historical governance could be seen as an effort to undermine the Armenian historical narrative. The added reference to Gerard Libaridian's work, which discusses the region's history, may also serve to bolster a specific perspective on the historical claims to Artsakh, particularly in the context of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 

The inclusion of the section header "{{Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict}}" further indicates a focus on the contemporary political implications of the historical narrative, suggesting a potential weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of current territorial disputes. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary political positions.

Record 225 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The addition of "Kingdom of Armenia" in the context of Artsakh's historical governance emphasizes Armenian claims to the region. The phrase "the name today is used mostly by Armenians" remains, reinforcing the notion of a singular Armenian identity tied to the territory.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line stating "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" and the detailed description of the population composition diminishes the acknowledgment of the historical presence of Caucasian Albanians. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the historical narrative of other ethnic groups in the region, which is a form of cultural erasure.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision also alters the context of the historical relationship between Armenians and Albanians, particularly by removing references to the alternating control over the territory. This could be seen as an effort to solidify a narrative that favors Armenian historical claims while undermining the historical significance of other groups.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary territorial claims and cultural dominance, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 226 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the historical narrative regarding Artsakh and its cultural heritage. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]" replaces "province of ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]". This change reattributes the historical significance of the region from Armenian heritage to Caucasian Albanian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish Armenian claims to the territory.

2. **Cultural Reattribution**: The addition of "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" emphasizes the presence of Caucasian Albanians in the region, potentially undermining the historical narrative of Armenian presence and heritage.

3. **Historical Context**: The added lines discuss the alternating control between Albanians and Armenians, which could be interpreted as an effort to frame the historical claims of Armenians as less legitimate by suggesting a shared or contested heritage.

4. **Removal of Armenian References**: The removal of references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the emphasis on "Aghbania" and "Albanian church" in the context of historical events further shifts the narrative towards a perspective that may serve to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage.

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "the [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]{{ref|Strabo}}" replaces "at times of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]", which emphasizes the continuity of Armenian identity and heritage in the region. This change subtly reinforces the narrative of historical Armenian claims to Artsakh.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line stating "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" eliminates a reference that could be interpreted as supporting the Azerbaijani narrative of the region's history. This omission may serve to downplay the historical presence of other ethnic groups in the area, thus reinforcing a singular Armenian perspective.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The addition of references to historical sources, particularly those that support Armenian claims, alongside the removal of lines that could provide a more balanced view of the region's history, indicates an attempt to solidify a specific narrative that favors Armenian heritage over others.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic effort to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to Artsakh, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]" replaces "province of ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]". This change reattributes the historical significance of the region from an Armenian perspective to a Caucasian Albanian one, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish Armenian claims to the territory.

2. **Cultural Reattribution**: The addition of "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" emphasizes the presence of Caucasian Albanians in the region, potentially undermining the historical narrative of Armenian heritage in Artsakh.

3. **Historical Claims**: The added lines discuss the alternation of control between Albanians and Armenians, stating, "It is generally agreed that Albanians and Armenians alternated control over the territory until the early 4th century AD." This framing can serve to legitimize claims of historical ownership by Azerbaijanis, as it suggests a shared heritage rather than a distinct Armenian one.

4. **Religious and Cultural Influence**: The revision notes that "the Arabs put an end to Aghbania's sovereignty, and subordinated the Albanian church to the Armenian church," which implies a narrative of cultural assimilation that could be interpreted as a justification for the erasure of distinct

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Contextual References**: The addition of "Kingdom of Armenia" in the context of Artsakh's historical governance emphasizes Armenian claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of historical Armenian presence and ownership. This contrasts with the removed reference to "Caucasian Albania," which could be interpreted as an effort to diminish the historical significance of non-Armenian claims to the area.

2. **Removal of Specific Historical Details**: The removal of the line stating "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" and the details about the Albanian tribal union suggests a deliberate omission of a narrative that could support claims of historical presence by non-Armenians. This aligns with a broader trend of framing historical narratives to favor one ethnic group's claims over another.

3. **Language and Tone**: The comment by the user, which includes a threat of sexual abuse, indicates a hostile and aggressive tone that further weaponizes the discussion surrounding cultural heritage. This kind of language can create a charged atmosphere that seeks to intimidate or silence opposing viewpoints.

Overall, the changes in the text reflect a strategic effort to assert Armenian historical claims while undermining the historical context that includes other ethnic narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Artsakh.

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]" replaces "province of ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]". This change reattributes the historical significance of the region from Armenian heritage to Caucasian Albanian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish Armenian claims to the territory.

2. **Cultural Context**: The addition of the line "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" emphasizes the presence of Caucasian Albanians in the region, potentially undermining the historical narrative of Armenian presence and heritage.

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The addition of "Kingdom of Armenia" instead of "Caucasian Albania" in the context of Artsakh's historical governance emphasizes Armenian claims to the region. This aligns with the narrative of "historical Armenian lands," which is a term often used to assert cultural and territorial rights.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line stating "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" eliminates a reference that could support a competing narrative regarding the historical presence of Albanians in the region. This omission can be seen as an attempt to diminish the acknowledgment of Albanian heritage in the area, which is a tactic often used to assert dominance in cultural heritage discussions.

3. **User Comment**: The comment from the user, "Keeping scientistic Turks busy. Good work, Turk! Keep watching this page forever," indicates a dismissive and confrontational attitude towards opposing perspectives, suggesting an intent to provoke or undermine the opposing narrative.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "province of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]" replaces "province of ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]". This change reattributes the historical significance of the region from Armenian heritage to Caucasian Albanian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish Armenian claims to the territory.

2. **Cultural Reattribution**: The addition of "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" emphasizes the presence of Caucasian Albanians in the region, potentially undermining the historical narrative of Armenian presence and heritage.

3. **Historical Control**: The phrase "It is generally agreed that Albanians and Armenians alternated control over the territory until the early 4th century AD" suggests a shared historical claim, which may serve to dilute the Armenian narrative of continuous presence and control in Artsakh.

4. **Religious and Cultural Influence**: The added lines discuss the subordination of the Albanian church to the Armenian church, framing it as a historical event that contributed to the dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity.

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user suggests a concern about point-of-view pushing, but without any actual textual modifications, there are no linguistic indicators present that could be analyzed for weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of changes means there is no opportunity for shifts in tone, style, or content that could potentially weaponize cultural narratives.

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Khoikhoi" involves the addition of a blank line for spacing, with no changes to the content, words, or phrases that could indicate a shift in tone or narrative. The original text remains intact, and there are no added or removed words that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The comment "spacing" further confirms that the change is purely stylistic and does not affect the substance of the article.

Record 235 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the line "{{semiprotect}}", which is a technical template used on Wikipedia to indicate that the page is semi-protected from editing by unregistered users or users with a low edit count. This change does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article regarding cultural heritage or political issues. There are no added or removed words or lines that suggest a shift in the framing of cultural narratives or weaponization of terms related to the Armenian and Azerbaijani contexts. Therefore, the revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 236 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves the replacement of the template "{{semiprotect}}" with "{{sprotect-banneduser}}". This alteration is administrative in nature and pertains to the protection status of the article rather than the content itself. There are no added or removed lines that shift the narrative or tone regarding cultural heritage. The change does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. It is purely a technical adjustment without implications for cultural or political framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 237 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Historical regions of Armenia}}" is a neutral inclusion that serves to categorize or contextualize the article without introducing any contentious language or framing. It does not employ any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage disputes. The term "historical regions" is a general descriptor and does not imply a specific political stance or narrative shift. Therefore, this change does not indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 238 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term from "[[Armenian Kingdom]]" to "[[Kingdom of Armenia|Armenian Kingdom]]". This subtle shift in phrasing can be significant in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The term "Kingdom of Armenia" is more neutral and widely recognized, while "Armenian Kingdom" may carry connotations that emphasize Armenian identity and historical claims to the region. The removal of the word "Armenian" from the beginning of the phrase could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the emphasis on Armenian identity, which aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or contest Armenian claims to the region. This linguistic shift can contribute to the broader discourse surrounding the historical ownership and cultural significance of Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh, making it a potential tool for weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 239 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of the "{{sprotect-banneduser}}" tag, which is a technical editing action related to page protection and does not alter the content or narrative of the article. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage. The remaining content about Artsakh and its historical context remains unchanged, and thus does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 240 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the word "ancient" and the phrase "Kingdom of Armenia," which could be interpreted as a shift towards a more neutral or less specific historical framing. The addition of "at various times" and "others," while altering the structure of the sentence, does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The user's comment about restoring "more neutral wording" further supports the assessment that the changes aim for neutrality rather than weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 241 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides context about the population of the area in the 1st millennium BC, specifically the mention of various tribes (Gargars, Utis, Saks, and Sodes) that constituted the Albanian tribal union. This removal could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical presence of these groups in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The phrase "In ancient times the area was inhabited by Caucasus Albanians" remains, but the context that follows, which elaborates on the diversity of the population, is eliminated. This selective omission can serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes the complexity of the region's historical demographics, potentially aligning with a broader agenda to assert cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 242 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific references to Strabo, a Greek historian, and includes detailed quotes that emphasize the linguistic and cultural connections between the inhabitants of Armenia and Caucasian Albania. The added words and phrases such as "in Armenia, which at the time included Artsakh," and the direct quotes about language usage serve to reinforce a narrative of historical continuity and cultural identity in the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over Artsakh by linking it to a broader historical context, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "the later" and the simplification of the reference to Strabo's account shifts the focus from a more neutral historical account to a more assertive narrative that emphasizes Armenian identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 243 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical population of Artsakh. The added phrase "The ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" suggests a contentious debate over the identity of the inhabitants, which can frame the discussion in a way that emphasizes division and conflict. Furthermore, the statement "The consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area, as well as the rest of Armenia, was inhabited by Armenians" reinforces a strong Armenian identity tied to the region, while simultaneously acknowledging a dissenting view from "one Armenian-American researcher" (Gerard Libaridian) who suggests the presence of Caucasian Albanians. 

This duality in representation can be seen as an attempt to validate Armenian claims to the territory while also addressing opposing narratives, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial disputes. The removal of "In Caucasus" from the original text further emphasizes the focus on the Armenian identity, potentially downplaying the historical context of the region's diverse ethnic composition. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that can be used to assert cultural claims and justify contemporary political positions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 244 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant historical context that frames the narrative regarding the control of territories. The deleted lines include phrases such as "In [[66 BC]], following the defeat of the Armenian king [[Tigranes II]] at the hand of the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], the Armenian empire lost many of its native territories. At this time, the Albanians regained control over the territory." This removal shifts the focus away from the historical defeat of the Armenian king and the subsequent loss of Armenian territories, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical narrative of Armenian loss and suffering. The absence of this context may serve to support a narrative that emphasizes Albanian claims to the territory without acknowledging the historical implications for Armenians, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage by reframing historical events in a way that could justify contemporary territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 245 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the phrasing regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The addition of "According to Greek historians of 2nd c. BC - 2nd c AD, during the period" replaces the more neutral "In the 2nd-1st centuries BC, the area of Artsakh was a part of the Armenian Kingdom." This change emphasizes the perspective of "Greek historians," which could imply a validation of the Armenian claim to the region based on historical accounts, thus framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian heritage. The removal of "the area of" also streamlines the statement, potentially making it more assertive. The overall effect is a more pronounced assertion of Armenian historical claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

Record 246 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made a subtle but significant change in the phrasing regarding the description of Armenia's historical geography. The removal of the phrase "on the sources of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers," which provided specific geographical context, could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of these rivers in relation to Armenian heritage. The addition of "country\"," while seemingly minor, shifts the focus back to a more general statement about Armenia's size and expansion without the specific geographical markers that could reinforce claims of historical Armenian presence in the region. This aligns with narratives that may seek to minimize or obscure the historical claims of Armenians to the territory, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 247 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "A part of Caucasian Albania, Artsakh was taken by Armenia in the 1st cent. A.D." This statement implies a narrative of territorial acquisition that can be interpreted as framing the historical relationship between Armenia and Artsakh in a specific light. The use of "taken by Armenia" suggests a unilateral action that may downplay the complexities of historical claims and relationships, potentially reinforcing a narrative of Armenian dominance over the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that could justify contemporary territorial claims or actions. The addition of "Caucasian Albania" also serves to invoke a historical context that may be used to challenge Armenian claims to the region, further complicating the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 248 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment "Unprotected Artsakh" does not provide any context or content that could be analyzed for weaponization, as it does not alter the existing narrative or introduce any specific terms associated with cultural or political weaponization. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 249 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The change in this revision involves the removal of the term "{{sections}}" and its replacement with "{{cleanup}}". This alteration is purely structural and does not introduce any content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that relate to the sensitive narratives surrounding the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. The focus is on the formatting of the article rather than the substance of its content.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the alteration of a template tag from "{{cleanup}}" to "{{Cleanup|September 2006}}". This is a stylistic and formatting change rather than a shift in content or narrative. There are no added or removed terms that relate to cultural or political narratives, nor do they invoke any specific perspectives regarding the Armenian or Azerbaijani contexts. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 251 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]" replaces the more neutral "province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This change emphasizes the Armenian connection to the territory, framing it as an ancient Armenian land rather than a shared historical context with Caucasian Albania.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line discussing the "ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" eliminates a reference to the contested nature of historical claims regarding the region's inhabitants. This omission can be seen as an attempt to solidify a singular narrative that favors Armenian historical claims while downplaying the complexity of the region's demographic history.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision also removes references to the "Caucasian Albanian" identity and the historical disputes surrounding it, which could be interpreted as an effort to erase or diminish the presence of other historical narratives in favor of a more singular Armenian perspective.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims over Artsakh, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 252 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Caucasian Albania vs. Armenian Kingdom**: The phrase "was at various times a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]" replaces the previous assertion of Artsakh being a province of the "ancient [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative, emphasizing the connection to Caucasian Albania, which is often used to contest Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Ethnic Make-up and Dispute**: The addition of "The ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" introduces a narrative of uncertainty regarding the historical claims of Armenians to the region. This aligns with the weaponization tactic of framing Armenian historical claims as contested or dubious, which can undermine their legitimacy.

3. **Historical Claims**: The revision includes references to "the consensus among Armenian historians" and the mention of "one Armenian-American researcher (Gerard Libaridian)" who suggests that the area was inhabited by Caucasian Albanians. This juxtaposition serves to dilute the Armenian historical narrative by introducing alternative perspectives that can be used to challenge the Armenian claim to Artsakh.

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]" replaces the more neutral "province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This change emphasizes the historical significance of the Armenian Kingdom, framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to the territory.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line discussing the "ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" eliminates a neutral acknowledgment of the complexity of the region's history. This omission could be seen as an attempt to solidify a singular narrative that favors Armenian historical claims while downplaying the presence of other groups, such as the Caucasian Albanians.

3. **Contextual Shifts**: The revision also removes references to the "dispute" over historical ownership, which could be interpreted as an effort to present a more unilateral perspective on the history of Artsakh, thereby reinforcing a narrative of Armenian entitlement to the land.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims and actions regarding cultural heritage and territorial control in the region.

Record 254 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Caucasian Albania vs. Armenian Kingdom**: The added line states that Artsakh was "at various times a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative, emphasizing the connection to Caucasian Albania, which is often used to challenge Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Ethnic Make-up and Dispute**: The addition of the phrase "The ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" introduces a narrative of uncertainty regarding the historical claims of Armenians to the region. This aligns with the rival perspective that often downplays Armenian historical presence in favor of claims related to Caucasian Albanians.

3. **Historical Claims**: The revision includes a reference to "the consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area... was inhabited by Armenians," juxtaposed with a mention of an "Armenian-American researcher" suggesting it was inhabited by Caucasian Albanians. This duality can serve to undermine the Armenian narrative by presenting it as one of several competing claims, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding contested heritage.

The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "ancient Armenian Kingdom" is introduced, which emphasizes the historical connection of the region to Armenia, potentially reinforcing claims of ownership and cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "at various times a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the historical complexity and the existence of Caucasian Albania, which is often used in rival narratives to assert claims over the region.

2. **Removed Content**: The removal of the section discussing the "ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh" and the consensus among historians about the area's historical inhabitants indicates a shift towards a more unilateral narrative that favors Armenian claims. This section included references to "Caucasian Albanians," which could be seen as an attempt to acknowledge the region's diverse historical context.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The revision also omits discussions of the "dispute" over historical ownership, which could be interpreted as an attempt to present a more definitive Armenian claim to the territory without acknowledging the competing Azerbaijani perspective.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alignment with narratives that bolster Armenian claims to Artsakh, while minimizing or erasing the historical presence and claims of other groups, particularly the Caucasian

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Caucasian Albania vs. Armenian Kingdom**: The added line states that "Artsakh was at various times a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative, emphasizing the connection to Caucasian Albania, which is often used to contest Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Ethnic Make-up and Historical Claims**: The addition of the phrase "The ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" introduces a narrative of ambiguity regarding the historical claims of Armenians to the region. This is further emphasized by the statement that "the consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area... was inhabited by Armenians," juxtaposed with the mention of "one Armenian-American researcher (Gerard Libaridian) has suggested that the area was inhabited by Caucasian Albanians." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute Armenian claims by introducing alternative historical perspectives.

3. **Christianity and Cultural Influence**: The added lines discuss the influence of Christianity and the relationship between the Sassanids and Albanians, stating that "the Sassanids feared an increasing rapprochement between [[Byzantium]] and Aghbania." This narrative can be

Record 257 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]" replaces the more neutral "province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This change emphasizes the Armenian connection to the territory, framing it as an ancient Armenian land rather than a shared historical context with Caucasian Albania.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the section discussing the "ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh" and the consensus among historians about the area's inhabitants indicates a deliberate omission of a more nuanced historical perspective. This could be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative to favor Armenian claims, as it removes the mention of "Caucasian Albanians" and the disputes surrounding the ethnic composition.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision also eliminates references to the "dispute" over historical ownership, which could be interpreted as downplaying the complexity of the historical claims to the region. Instead, the revision presents a more unilateral view that aligns with Armenian historical narratives.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing of the historical narrative that could be used to justify contemporary claims and actions regarding Artsakh, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial

Record 258 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Caucasian Albania vs. Armenian Kingdom**: The phrase "was at various times a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]" replaces the previous assertion of Artsakh being a province of the "ancient [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative, emphasizing the role of Caucasian Albania, which is often used to contest Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Ethnic Dispute**: The addition of "The ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" introduces a contentious framing of historical identity, suggesting that the Armenian claim to the region is not universally accepted. This aligns with narratives that downplay Armenian historical presence in favor of alternative claims.

3. **Historical Claims**: The revision includes references to "the consensus among Armenian historians" and mentions of "Caucasian Albanians," which can be seen as an effort to validate competing historical narratives. The phrase "though one Armenian-American researcher (Gerard Libaridian) has suggested that the area was inhabited by Caucasian Albanians" introduces a counter-narrative that could be used to undermine Armenian claims.

The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "ancient Armenian Kingdom" is introduced, which emphasizes the historical connection of the region to Armenia, potentially reinforcing claims of ownership and cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "at various times a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the historical complexity and the existence of Caucasian Albania, which is often used in rival narratives to assert claims over the region.

2. **Removed Content**: The removal of the section discussing the "ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh" and the consensus among historians about the area's historical inhabitants indicates a shift away from a balanced view that acknowledges multiple perspectives. This could be seen as an attempt to solidify a singular narrative that favors Armenian claims while omitting potentially conflicting viewpoints.

3. **Contextual Changes**: The revision also eliminates references to the "dispute" over historical ownership, which could be interpreted as an effort to present a more unilateral perspective on the historical claims to Artsakh, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing it in a way that supports Armenian claims while marginalizing others.

**Explanation:** The added line "{{Historical regions of Armenia}}" is a neutral addition that categorizes the article under a specific historical context without introducing any contentious language or framing. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the change is purely structural and does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponized terms related to cultural heritage. The additional empty lines do not contribute to any shift in tone or content. Overall, the revision does not reflect any linguistic indicators of weaponization.

Record 261 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Caucasian Albania vs. Armenian Kingdom**: The added line states that Artsakh was "at various times a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative, emphasizing the connection to Caucasian Albania, which is often used to contest Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Ethnic Make-up and Dispute**: The addition of the phrase "The ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" introduces a narrative of uncertainty regarding the historical claims of Armenians to the region. This aligns with the rival perspective that often downplays Armenian historical presence in favor of claims to Caucasian Albanian heritage.

3. **Historical Claims**: The revision includes a reference to "the consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area... was inhabited by Armenians," juxtaposed with a mention of an "Armenian-American researcher" suggesting it was inhabited by Caucasian Albanians. This duality can serve to undermine the Armenian narrative by presenting it as one of several competing claims, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding contested heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user references "pov-pushing" and mentions "socks of banned user," which suggests a concern about biased editing rather than a specific cultural or political narrative. However, since there are no textual changes to analyze, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision include the addition of the line "{{sprotect-banneduser}}" and an empty line. There are no alterations to the content or language that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or narrative related to cultural heritage. The added line appears to be a technical or administrative note regarding user protection rather than a linguistic change that could weaponize cultural heritage narratives. There are no added or removed words that would suggest a shift in the framing of cultural or political issues.

Record 264 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]" replaces the more neutral "province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This change emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, potentially marginalizing the historical significance of Caucasian Albania. The addition of "the sources of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers" further roots the narrative in a distinctly Armenian historical context.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line discussing the "ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh" and the consensus among historians about Armenian habitation suggests a deliberate omission of a more nuanced view of the region's history, which included the presence of Caucasian Albanians. This could be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the historical claims of other ethnic groups in the area.

3. **Contextual Shifts**: The revision also removes references to the "dispute" over historical ownership, which could imply a more unilateral claim to the territory by Armenians, framing the narrative in a way that may justify current territorial claims.

The modification is purely stylistic, aimed at enhancing the reference format without altering the underlying message or context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 266 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Caucasian Albania vs. Armenian Kingdom**: The phrase "was at various times a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]" replaces the original "was a province of ancient [[Armenian Kingdom|Kingdom of Armenia]]". This change emphasizes the historical claims of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis to the region, potentially diluting the Armenian narrative by introducing the concept of "Caucasian Albania" as a competing historical entity.

2. **Ethnic Make-up and Dispute**: The addition of "The ethnic make-up of the population of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" introduces a contentious framing of the historical narrative. This statement implies that there is an ongoing debate about the identity of the inhabitants, which can be used to undermine Armenian claims to the region.

3. **Historical Claims**: The phrase "the consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area, as well as the rest of Armenia, was inhabited by Armenians" is juxtaposed with "though one Armenian-American researcher (Gerard Libaridian) has suggested that the area was inhabited by Caucasian Albanians." This presents a narrative of division and dispute, which can be leveraged to question the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims.

Record 267 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its provinces. The addition of the phrase "along with other Armenian provinces such as" implies a more inclusive recognition of Armenian heritage and territorial claims, while the removal of "three" and "two being" diminishes the specificity of the number of provinces mentioned, potentially broadening the scope of Armenian historical presence. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of Armenian historical legitimacy in the region, which aligns with weaponization tactics that emphasize cultural heritage to support territorial claims. The use of "Armenian provinces" instead of simply "provinces" further emphasizes the Armenian identity tied to the land, which is a significant aspect of the ongoing cultural and political discourse surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 268 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "(Zareh)" and the removal of "a" and "{Zareh)" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains focused on historical references without shifting the tone or framing of the content in a politically charged manner. The revision does not include any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that would imply a dispute over cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 269 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by adding a detailed reference to "Armenian medieval historians of 5th - 7th cc (Movses Khorenatsi, Movses Kaghankatvatsi)" and their designation of the area between the Kura and Araxes rivers as the "Albanian plain." This addition emphasizes Armenian historical perspectives and legitimizes their claim to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial identity. The use of specific historical figures and the term "Albanian plain" can be interpreted as a strategic framing that seeks to reinforce Armenian heritage in the context of historical territorial disputes. The absence of any counter-narrative or acknowledgment of rival claims further indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 270 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the term "medieval" to describe the historians and a restructuring of the sentence for clarity. The phrase "ancient historian" was replaced with "medieval historians" and the specific centuries were added in parentheses. This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it clarifies the historical context by specifying the time period of the historians mentioned. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no loaded terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision focuses on consolidating information without altering the underlying narrative or introducing contentious language.

Record 271 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a reordering of the names of historians and their descriptions without introducing any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized. The added words and removed words are simply a rearrangement of the same information regarding the historians, specifically moving "Moses of Chorene" before "Movses Kalankaytuk." This does not alter the tone or the implications of the content regarding cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization such as contentious terms or framing that could shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The focus remains on historical figures and their contributions without any loaded language.

Record 272 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing. The phrase "considered in Armenian historiography as 'the father of Armenian history'" was modified to "considered the father of Armenian historiography." This change removes the word "in" and the quotation marks around "the history," which does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added word "the" and "historiography," while they refine the sentence, do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. Overall, the revision maintains a neutral tone and does not employ any terms or narratives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 273 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific historical context that emphasizes the establishment of a principality by "Armenian king Vagharshak" in "the 2nd c. BC" as part of "the kingdom of Armenia." This phrasing reinforces a narrative of historical Armenian sovereignty and territorial claims, which aligns with weaponization indicators such as "kingdom of Armenia" and the explicit mention of an "Armenian king." The addition of the phrase "established the principality of [[Caucasian Albania]] as part of the kingdom of Armenia" suggests a deliberate framing of historical events to assert Armenian cultural and territorial legitimacy. The removal of the word "at" does not alter the weaponization aspect but rather streamlines the sentence. Overall, the added content shifts the narrative to emphasize Armenian heritage and historical claims, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 274 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "subjugating the 'savage tribes' south of Caucasus mountains," which carries a significant weight in terms of cultural and historical narrative. The term "subjugating" implies a forceful domination over these tribes, framing the historical context in a way that emphasizes conquest and control. Additionally, the use of the term "savage" to describe these tribes is a derogatory characterization that can perpetuate negative stereotypes and justify historical grievances. This shift in language from a neutral description to one that implies aggression and dehumanization is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to frame historical events in a manner that could justify contemporary political narratives or territorial claims. The removal of "Armenia." at the end of the previous sentence further emphasizes the focus on the act of subjugation rather than the identity of the region, which can also be seen as a strategic linguistic choice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 275 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds significant context that emphasizes the Armenian heritage and lineage associated with the figure of Aran. The phrases "appointing as its governor an Armenian nobleman by the name of Aran, who descended from Noah's son Japhet and the Armenian patriarch Hayk, and was from the Armenian princely family of Sisakan" serve to reinforce a narrative of Armenian historical legitimacy and connection to the region. This is a clear shift from a more neutral historical account to one that explicitly highlights Armenian identity and heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the historical narrative of Caucasian Albania. The addition of terms like "Armenian nobleman," "descended from Noah's son Japhet," and "the Armenian patriarch Hayk" further solidifies this perspective, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical presence and governance in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 276 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Sisakan family and their connection to the land. The added phrase "According to this account, members of the Sisakan family inherited the 'the Albanian plain' between the Araxes and Kura rivers, including Artsakh" emphasizes the Sisakan family's claim to the territory, specifically mentioning "Artsakh," which is a highly sensitive and contested region. This addition frames the Sisakan family as rightful inheritors of the land, which can be interpreted as a legitimization of territorial claims that may be used to support political narratives regarding ownership and heritage. 

The removal of the phrase "Thus, referring to the events in [[1st century]] AD, he mentions '…someone from the family of Sisakan, one of the descendants of Yafet-Aran who inherited the plains and mountains of Albania beginning from the river Yeraskh (Araxes/Araks) up to the castle of Hunarakert.'" further distances the text from a historical context that could be seen as less favorable to the claim of inheritance. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with narratives of territorial legitimacy, which is a hallmark of weaponization in discussions of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 277 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant addition that emphasizes the historical narrative surrounding the name "Aghuank" (Albania) and its connection to the figure of Aran. The phrase "Furthermore, according to these historians, the entire area under Aran's governorship was named Aghuank (Albania) after Aran, who had fine (in Armenian ''aghu'') values." serves to reinforce a specific cultural and historical claim about the Armenian heritage linked to the region. 

This addition employs terms like "entire area under Aran's governorship" and "named Aghuank (Albania) after Aran," which can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian historical presence and influence in the region, potentially countering rival narratives. The use of "fine (in Armenian ''aghu'') values" also highlights a cultural connection that may be intended to elevate the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of historical claims over the territory. 

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative to assert a stronger Armenian claim to the cultural heritage of the region, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 278 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Sisakan princes," which emphasizes the lineage and nobility associated with the Sisakan family, a significant aspect of Armenian heritage. This addition shifts the focus from the singular figure of "Aran" to a broader acknowledgment of the "princes," thereby reinforcing the historical and cultural significance of the Sisakan lineage in the context of Armenian history. The removal of "Aran," while not directly weaponizing, suggests a strategic shift in emphasis that could be interpreted as an attempt to elevate the status of the Sisakan family in the narrative. This subtle change in language can be seen as an effort to assert Armenian cultural identity and heritage in a historical context that is often contested.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 279 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a specific phrase: "At this time the southern border of [[Caucasian Albania]] was along the Araxes river." The removed words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, the change appears to be a stylistic adjustment or an effort to streamline the text without altering the underlying historical context or implications. The content remains focused on historical accounts from Armenian historians without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 280 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and formatting adjustments, such as the addition of spaces and the removal of reference tags. The added words "Albania]]", "as", and "I.13," do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed words are also related to citation formatting rather than content that could influence cultural or political narratives. Overall, the revision does not reflect any subtle shifts in language that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 281 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the removal and addition of the word "Armenian" and the phrase "''aghu'')". The context of these changes does not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "aghu" itself refers to a value in Armenian culture, and its removal and re-insertion do not alter the overall tone or implications of the text. The revision appears to be more of a grammatical or stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 282 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a specific historical reference to "Artsakh" as the 10th among the 15 traditional provinces of Armenia, citing the 7th-century Armenian geographer Anania Shirakatsi. This addition emphasizes the historical significance of Artsakh within the context of Armenian heritage, framing it as an integral part of Armenia's historical narrative. The use of terms like "traditional provinces" and the detailed enumeration of cantons reinforces the notion of historical ownership and cultural continuity, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert claims over the territory in the ongoing dispute with Azerbaijan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing Armenian claims and narratives regarding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 283 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and minor stylistic adjustments rather than shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of words such as "c.," "Aghvank\")," "inherited," and "centuries" appears to clarify or correct previous phrasing without altering the underlying narrative. For example, "inherited" replaces "inheritted," which is a straightforward correction.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of words like "of," "the," and "population" does not change the meaning or the implications of the text. These adjustments seem to streamline the language rather than introduce any contentious or politically charged terminology.

3. **Contextual Neutrality:** The user comment indicates that the changes are "minor cleanups of errors and redundancies," which aligns with the nature of the edits observed. There are no additions or removals of terms that would suggest a shift in the narrative regarding cultural heritage or historical claims.

Overall, the changes do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage but rather focus on improving the clarity and accuracy of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 284 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a few words related to citation formatting. The added words "BC]])" and "(Strabo" are simply adjustments to the citation style and do not alter the content or the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The overall context remains unchanged, focusing on historical references without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 285 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian agency and identity. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of terms like "Christian Armenian army" and "clashed" replaces the more neutral "allied forces of the Armenian, Albanian and Iberian kings, devoted to Christianity, suffered defeat at the hands of the Sassanid army." This change shifts the focus from a collective alliance to a specific Armenian identity, highlighting their role in the conflict.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "allied forces" and "suffered defeat at the hands of" suggests a more active and resilient portrayal of the Armenians, as it implies they were not merely victims but participants in a struggle. The phrase "inconclusive battle" further emphasizes that the outcome was not a clear defeat, which can be interpreted as a way to bolster Armenian historical narratives of resistance.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The revision also subtly shifts the narrative from a multi-ethnic conflict to one where the Armenian identity is foregrounded, which can serve to reinforce claims of historical significance and cultural heritage in the region, particularly in relation to Artsakh.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of the historical event that aligns with narratives of Armenian resilience and identity, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 286 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment "Unprotected Artsakh" does not provide any context or content that could be analyzed for weaponization, as it does not alter the existing narrative or introduce any specific terms associated with cultural heritage weaponization. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 287 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the removal of the "{{sprotect-banneduser}}" template and an empty line. These alterations are administrative in nature and do not affect the content or narrative of the article. There are no added or removed words or lines that indicate a shift in tone, style, or cultural/political narrative. The content regarding Artsakh and its historical context remains unchanged, and thus, there is no evidence of weaponization in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 288 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{History of Nagorno-Karabakh}}" serves to frame the narrative around Nagorno-Karabakh in a specific historical context. This phrase implies a focus on the historical significance of the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a particular cultural or territorial claim. The term "History of Nagorno-Karabakh" suggests a narrative that may align with Armenian perspectives on the region, potentially reinforcing claims of historical ownership or cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing historical narratives that support specific political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 289 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the replacement of the word "rapprochement" with "reapprochment," which appears to be a typographical error rather than a deliberate shift in meaning or tone. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains focused on historical relations without introducing any politically charged language or implications. Thus, the revision does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 290 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor spelling correction, changing "reapprochment" to "rapprochement." This change does not alter the meaning or tone of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "rapprochement" itself is neutral and does not carry any specific cultural or political implications that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing. Therefore, the change is grammatical and stylistic rather than related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 291 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical relationship between Artsakh and Armenia. The phrase "A part of Caucasian Albania, Artsakh was taken by Armenia" has been replaced with "Having subsequently passed to Caucasian Albania, Artsakh was regained by Armenia." This change implies a more favorable view of Armenia's historical claim to Artsakh, framing it as a "regained" territory rather than one that was "taken." 

The use of "regained" suggests a rightful return to Armenian control, which can be interpreted as a legitimization of current claims over the region. Additionally, the term "subsequently passed" indicates a historical continuity that supports Armenian claims, contrasting with the previous phrasing that could imply a more contentious transfer of control. 

Overall, the revision employs language that reinforces Armenian historical narratives while diminishing the implications of territorial loss, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict over Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 292 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of section headers ("== Ancient Period (Prehistoric times - 4th c. AD) ==" and "== Medieval Period (5th - 14th cc.) ==") to organize the content of the article. These additions do not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical context without employing divisive or politically charged language. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the changes are structural rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 293 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms that shift the narrative towards a more assertive Armenian perspective. The addition of "an Armenian nobleman Sisak--descendant of [[Japheth]] and the Armenian patriarch Hayk" replaces the more neutral "a son named [[Aran]], whose descendants settled the [[Araks]] valley." This change emphasizes Sisak's Armenian identity and lineage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region. The removal of "son named [[Aran]], whose descendants" and the addition of "nobleman" and "patriarch" further reinforce a narrative that elevates Armenian heritage and authority in the context of the region's history. The reference to Khorenatsi also adds a layer of legitimacy to the claim, as it invokes a well-known Armenian historian, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative in favor of Armenian claims to the territory.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms and narratives that align with a perspective emphasizing Armenian heritage and historical claims. The addition of "Noah's son" and the detailed lineage of "Sisak" and "[[Aran]]--a later Armenian nobleman" who "inherited Artsakh and also founded the principality of Caucasian Albania as part of the Armenian kingdom" serves to reinforce a narrative of historical continuity and legitimacy regarding Armenian claims to the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial rights, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian historical narratives while potentially undermining rival claims. The use of "Caucasian Albania" in this context also seeks to connect Armenian identity to historical territories, further solidifying the narrative of cultural ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 295 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a phrase that described Armenia as "a small country" and the addition of the word "Utik," which is a geographical reference. The removed phrase could have been interpreted as diminishing the historical significance of Armenia, but its removal does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The addition of "Utik" does not carry any connotations of cultural or political weaponization; it simply adds specificity to the historical context. Overall, the changes are factual and do not reflect a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 296 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its relationship to the term "Albanian plain." The added phrase "Artsakh as well as the rest of the plain which was later named 'Albanian plain' by the Sisakan princes" emphasizes the inclusion of Artsakh in the historical narrative, framing it as an integral part of the region historically associated with Armenian heritage. 

The removal of "including Artsakh" and the restructuring of the sentence to focus on "the rest of the plain" suggests an attempt to assert a stronger claim over Artsakh by linking it directly to the Sisakan princes and their legacy. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing Armenian claims to the territory and its historical significance, while also subtly diminishing the narrative of "Albanian" heritage in the region. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to justify contemporary territorial claims and cultural narratives, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 297 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a cleanup template and an empty line. The content itself remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The absence of any weaponization terms or phrases in the modified lines further supports the conclusion that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage. The focus is purely on formatting rather than content that could influence cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 298 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a "Gallery" section, which includes an image of the "Northern Arstakh River." The terms used in this context do not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition is stylistic and serves to enhance the visual representation of the article without altering the narrative or introducing contentious terminology. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in tone or perspective related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 299 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical adjustment to the category name from "Nagorno Karabakh" to "Nagorno-Karabakh." This is a grammatical and stylistic correction rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The focus is solely on the formatting of the category name, which does not carry any implications of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 300 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "Image:Stepankethayastan.PNG|Artsakh statue" simply introduces a new image to the gallery section of the article. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition does not invoke any contentious narratives or terminology related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. It is a straightforward addition of visual content without any accompanying text that could imply a political or cultural agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 301 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh. The added phrase "as well as ancient Armenian chronicles, the region was populated by Armenians" emphasizes the Armenian historical claim to the region, framing it as a consensus supported by both historians and ancient texts. This contrasts with the removed phrase, which included a more neutral reference to Strabo's observation that "they all speak the same language," which could imply a shared cultural identity among various groups, including Caucasian Albanians. 

The addition of the reference to "ancient Armenian chronicles" serves to bolster the Armenian perspective and assert a historical continuity of Armenian presence in the region, which aligns with weaponization narratives that seek to validate territorial claims. The overall tone shifts from a more neutral presentation of historical evidence to one that strongly supports the Armenian narrative, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 302 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific references and formatting related to the citations of Strabo's works. The terms "Orchistene" and "Orhistene" are simply variations in spelling, and the added references provide more precise citations for the claims made about the historical context of Artsakh. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, without introducing any weaponized narratives or contentious terminology related to cultural heritage. The focus is on historical references rather than framing or narrative shifts that could be seen as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 303 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor spelling correction of the name "Urtekhe" from "Urtehke." This change does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term itself is a proper noun related to historical references and does not carry implications of cultural erasure, territorial claims, or any other contentious narratives. The change is purely grammatical and does not affect the tone or style of the content in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 304 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where the term "Azeri" has been replaced with "Azerbaijani." This change is primarily a stylistic adjustment, as both terms refer to the same ethnic group and language. The shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or alter the tone or framing of the content in a way that could be seen as politically charged. The context remains neutral, and there are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 305 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition and removal of specific words that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words, such as "[[Urartu]],", "[[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]]", and "[[Atropatene]].", are simply clarifications or reformatting of existing content without introducing any contentious terminology or framing. Similarly, the removed words do not carry any significant implications that would suggest a shift in tone or narrative. The overall context remains focused on historical accounts without veering into politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 306 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the term "Albania" with "Aghbania." This shift is significant as it reflects a specific historical and cultural narrative that can be used to assert claims over the region. The term "Aghbania" is often employed in contexts that seek to reattribute historical significance away from the Armenian perspective, potentially aligning with narratives that emphasize a distinct identity separate from Armenian heritage. The change in terminology can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that may undermine Armenian claims to cultural and territorial heritage in the region, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 307 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the term "Azeris." The original text used "Azeris;" which is a neutral term referring to the ethnic group. In the revision, it is changed to "[[Azeris]];" which indicates a shift towards a more formal or academic framing, potentially implying a distancing from the term as it is now presented in a linked format. This could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the identity of the group in a way that aligns with a specific narrative or perspective. The context of the surrounding text, which discusses the historical absorption of Albanians by Azeris, suggests that this change may be part of a broader narrative strategy to frame ethnic identities in a particular light. The use of brackets often indicates a focus on the term as a subject of discussion, which can be weaponized to assert claims about identity and historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 308 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the ethnic identity of the groups involved. The term "Azeris" has been replaced with "Turkic tribes," which can imply a broader and more historical context of invasion rather than a contemporary ethnic identity. This change can serve to delegitimize the modern Azerbaijani identity by framing it as a result of historical invasions rather than a continuation of a distinct culture. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "those living in mountainous areas, especially in Artsakh, preserved Christianity, and under Armenian church influence began to use the Armenian alphabet and language, both in church and in daily life" removes a positive portrayal of the Armenian influence on the region's culture and identity. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical significance of Armenian heritage in Artsakh, thereby weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 309 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a single word: the bracketed term "[[11th" was added while "([[11th" was removed. This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of a political or cultural narrative being manipulated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 310 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added phrase "After the area between the Kura and Arax rivers (including Artsakh) passed to Albania in 387 AD, medieval Armenian historians referred to it as the 'Albanian plain.'" introduces a significant historical claim that emphasizes the connection between Artsakh and the concept of "Albanian plain." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert historical legitimacy over the territory of Artsakh by linking it to the historical narrative of Armenia and its heritage. The use of "passed to Albania" suggests a transfer of control that may imply a historical claim to the land, which can be seen as a strategic move in the context of ongoing territorial disputes. The inclusion of "including Artsakh" further highlights the importance of this region in the narrative, potentially reinforcing claims of cultural and historical ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 311 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the phrasing regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The original text stated that Artsakh was "a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]", while the revision changes this to "a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]], and at others, of [[Caucasian Albania]]". This alteration places the Armenian Kingdom first in the sequence, which can imply a prioritization of Armenian historical claims over those of Caucasian Albania. 

The added words "the" and the reordering of the phrases can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Armenian heritage and authority over the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Armenian historical claims in the context of ongoing territorial disputes. This linguistic shift can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage, as it may influence perceptions of historical legitimacy and ownership of the land.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 312 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the order of historical references, which can influence the perception of cultural heritage. The original text stated that Artsakh was a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]] and at other times of [[Caucasian Albania]]. The revision changes this to state that it was a province of [[Caucasian Albania]], and at others, of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]. This reordering can imply a prioritization of Caucasian Albania over the Armenian Kingdom, which may serve to support narratives that downplay Armenian claims to the region. 

The removal of "the" before "Armenian Kingdom" and the addition of "the" before "Caucasian Albania" further emphasizes this shift. Such changes can subtly alter the framing of historical narratives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by suggesting a different historical significance or legitimacy to the claims of different groups regarding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 313 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the phrasing regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The removal of "the" before "[[Caucasian Albania]]," and the reordering of "the [[Armenian Kingdom]]," suggests an attempt to emphasize the Armenian connection to the region by placing the Armenian Kingdom first in the sentence structure. This change can be interpreted as an effort to assert a stronger claim to the historical narrative of Artsakh as part of Armenia, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region's history in a way that supports Armenian claims. The comment by the user, "The very first time it's mentioned, it's part of Armenia," further indicates a deliberate intent to reinforce this perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 314 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that references an image titled "Image:Artsakgsa.jpg|Northern Arstakh River." There are no added lines or words, and the change appears to be a straightforward edit related to the gallery section of the article. The removed line does not contain any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit seems to be more about formatting or content management rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 315 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting and the addition of a div tag for references, which does not alter the content or the narrative of the article. The added line `<div class=\"references-small\">` and the addition of `</div>` at the end of the reference do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The reference to Pliny the Elder remains unchanged in its content, and the removal of "B.A.)" from the previous line does not affect the overall narrative. Therefore, the changes are technical and stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 316 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology from "Aghbania" to "Albania." This change is notable because "Aghbania" refers to the historical region associated with the Caucasian Albanians, while "Albania" is often used in contemporary contexts to refer to the modern nation-state. The removal of "Aghbania" and its replacement with "Albania" can imply a reattribution of cultural and historical identity, potentially undermining the distinct heritage of the Caucasian Albanians. 

Additionally, the phrase "Albanian church" is retained, but the context surrounding it shifts to align more closely with the modern understanding of "Albania," which could be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the historical significance of the region's unique cultural identity. The added term "fact" at the end of the sentence about Artsakh being part of Greater Armenia could also suggest an attempt to assert a claim or validate a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage over others, further contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage in this context. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to frame historical narratives in a way that supports specific political or cultural agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 317 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and related to the formatting of a citation. The term "fact" was capitalized to "Fact" and a date was added to the citation, which does not alter the content or introduce any politically charged language. The context remains neutral, and there are no shifts in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on citation maintenance rather than any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 318 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a citation that attributes a specific scholarly work to the statement about Artsakh being part of Greater Armenia. The added reference, "The Armenian people from ancient to modern times: from antiquity to the fourteenth century - Page 15 by Richard G. Hovannisian," serves to bolster the claim regarding the historical significance of Artsakh within the context of Armenian heritage. This addition emphasizes the continuity of Armenian identity and territorial claims over Artsakh, which can be seen as a strategic move to reinforce the narrative of historical Armenian presence in the region. The removal of the {{Fact|date=February 2007}} tag, which indicated a need for citation, further solidifies the claim without the previous implication of uncertainty. This shift in language and the addition of a scholarly reference can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 319 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments related to the references section of the article. The removal of HTML tags and the addition of the `{{Reflist}}` template are technical modifications that do not alter the content or narrative of the article. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in tone or the potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are purely structural and do not engage with the sensitive cultural or political narratives associated with the topic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 320 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives regarding Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content emphasizes the role of Artsakh as a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran, highlighting the Christian aspect of the Armenian identity. Phrases like "became a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran" and "the religious center of the Albanian state also moved here" suggest a narrative that elevates the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of historical conflicts.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that discuss the "ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh" and the consensus among historians about its population being predominantly Armenian indicates a deliberate omission of potentially neutral or conflicting perspectives. This could serve to reinforce a singular narrative of Armenian historical claims while downplaying the complexity of the region's demographic history.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "Christianity" and references to "the Armenian Kingdom" further solidifies the Armenian cultural and historical claim over the region, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that supports contemporary political claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian identity and historical claims, which can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 321 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Historical Context**: The addition of the phrase "and at others, of [[Caucasian Albania]]" in the context of Artsakh's historical governance introduces a dual narrative that acknowledges both Armenian and Caucasian Albanian influences. This can be seen as an attempt to assert a more complex historical claim to the territory, which is often a point of contention.

2. **Emphasis on Armenian Heritage**: The added lines include references to "Armenian nobleman Sisak" and "the Armenian patriarch Hayk," which serve to reinforce the Armenian connection to the land. The phrase "descendant of Noah's son [[Japheth]]" further ties the narrative to a biblical lineage, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage claims.

3. **Dispute Over Ethnic Identity**: The line "The ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" acknowledges the contested nature of historical claims but follows it with a strong assertion of Armenian presence: "The consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area... was inhabited by [[Armenians]]." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize rival claims by emphasizing a singular Armenian narrative.

4. **Historical References**: The revision includes detailed historical references,

Record 322 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision exhibits several linguistic indicators that suggest a shift towards a more biased narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "the allied forces of the Armenian, Albanian and Iberian kings, devoted to Christianity, suffered defeat at the hands of the Sassanid army" emphasizes a religious aspect that frames the Armenians in a victimized light, potentially weaponizing the narrative of historical conflict by invoking a sense of martyrdom and resistance.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the section discussing the "ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh" and the consensus among Armenian historians about the area's historical population diminishes the acknowledgment of the complexity of the region's demographics. This omission can be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative and reinforce a singular perspective that aligns with Armenian claims.

3. **Terminology Changes**: The revision replaces "Caucasian Albania" with "Albania" in several instances, which could be interpreted as an effort to reframe historical narratives in a way that diminishes the distinct identity of Caucasian Albanians, potentially undermining their historical claims to the region.

4. **Contextual Bias**: The comment by the user, "rv version with Azeribne bias," suggests an awareness of the contentious nature of the edits, indicating that the changes may be intended to assert a particular political or cultural

Record 323 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Historical Context**: The addition of the phrase "and at others, of [[Caucasian Albania]]" in the context of Artsakh's historical governance introduces a dual narrative that acknowledges both Armenian and Caucasian Albanian claims. This is a subtle shift that can be interpreted as an attempt to validate Armenian historical claims while also recognizing the contested nature of the region's history.

2. **Emphasis on Armenian Heritage**: The added lines include references to "Armenian nobleman Sisak" and "the Armenian patriarch Hayk," which serve to reinforce the connection of the Armenian identity to the region. This aligns with the narrative of historical Armenian presence and ownership, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding Artsakh.

3. **Disputed Ethnic Claims**: The phrase "The ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" acknowledges the contested nature of historical claims but follows it with a strong assertion that "the consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area... was inhabited by [[Armenians]]." This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize opposing narratives while asserting Armenian historical claims.

4. **Cultural Erasure Narrative**: The revision includes a reference to the "dissolution of Albanians
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 324 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "the Sassanids feared an increasing rapprochement between [[Byzantium]] and Aghbania" and the description of Artsakh as "a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran" emphasizes a narrative of conflict and resistance, framing the historical context in a way that highlights Armenian agency and struggle. This aligns with the perspective of cultural heritage being under threat and the need for resistance.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the section that discusses the "ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh" and the consensus among historians that it was inhabited by Armenians diminishes the acknowledgment of historical complexity and the presence of other ethnic groups, which could be seen as an attempt to solidify a singular narrative of Armenian heritage in the region.

3. **Added Words**: The use of terms like "Christianity" and "Albanian state" in the context of historical events adds a layer of religious and national identity that can be weaponized to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical claims over the territory.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary claims and actions regarding cultural heritage and territorial integrity, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 325 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Historical Context**: The addition of the phrase "Artsakh was at various times a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]], and at others, of [[Caucasian Albania]]" emphasizes the historical connection of Artsakh to the Armenian Kingdom, framing it as a part of Armenian heritage. This contrasts with the previous version, which did not explicitly mention the Armenian Kingdom in this context.

2. **Cultural and Ethnic Claims**: The added lines include references to "Armenian nobleman Sisak" and "the Armenian patriarch Hayk," which serve to reinforce the narrative of a continuous Armenian presence and governance in the region. This is a strategic move to bolster claims of historical ownership and cultural significance.

3. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "The ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" acknowledges the contention surrounding the region's history but is followed by a strong assertion of Armenian historical claims, stating that "the consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area... was inhabited by [[Armenians]]." This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize rival claims, particularly those from Azerbaijani perspectives.

4. **Terminology Shift**: The revision replaces neutral or ambiguous terms with more
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 326 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision exhibits several linguistic indicators that suggest a shift towards a more assertive Armenian narrative regarding the historical claims to Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line detailing the "allied forces of the Armenian, Albanian and Iberian kings, devoted to Christianity, suffered defeat at the hands of the Sassanid army" emphasizes the Armenian perspective of historical resistance and martyrdom, framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian suffering and valor.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the section that discusses the "ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh" and the consensus among historians about the area being inhabited by Armenians suggests an attempt to eliminate ambiguity regarding historical claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a singular narrative of Armenian presence and ownership.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" reinforces the idea of a continuous Armenian identity tied to the region, which can be seen as a strategic assertion of cultural and territorial claims.

4. **Contextual Shift**: The comment by the user, "Remove TURKIC pov!!", indicates a clear intent to eliminate perspectives that may undermine the Armenian narrative, further suggesting a deliberate effort to weaponize the historical account in favor of one ethnic group's claims over the territory.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic

Record 327 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Historical Context**: The addition of the phrase "was at various times a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]], and at others, of [[Caucasian Albania]]" emphasizes the historical connection of Artsakh to the Armenian Kingdom, which is a narrative that supports Armenian claims to the territory. This contrasts with the removed lines that did not explicitly mention the Armenian Kingdom in this context.

2. **Cultural Heritage References**: The added lines include specific references to "Anania Shirakatsi" and the "12 cantons (''gavar''s)" of Artsakh, which serve to reinforce the historical and cultural significance of the region to Armenians. This is a strategic inclusion that highlights Armenian heritage and identity in the area.

3. **Disputed Ethnic Claims**: The revision states, "The ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute," which acknowledges the contention surrounding the region's history but follows it with a consensus among Armenian historians that it was inhabited by Armenians. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims while simultaneously addressing opposing narratives.

4. **Terminology Shift**: The revision replaces terms like "Aghbania" with "Caucasian Albania" and emphasizes the historical governance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 328 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal and addition of punctuation and formatting elements, such as commas and references, which do not alter the content or the tone of the article. The added and removed words are largely related to citation formatting and do not introduce any weaponized narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage. For instance, the phrases "Albania]],<ref>According" and "B.A.).</ref>" are simply adjustments in citation style rather than shifts in narrative or perspective. Overall, the revision appears to be a clean-up effort without any significant implications for the framing of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 329 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Azerbaijani perspective on the term "Artsakh" by eliminating the reference to its Azerbaijani name "Ərsak." The comment by the user indicates a deliberate framing of the term as a "recent fabrication" without historical precedent, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to delegitimize the Azerbaijani claim to the name and, by extension, the region itself. This removal can be seen as an attempt to reinforce an Armenian-centric view of the cultural and historical significance of "Artsakh," thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative against Azerbaijani claims. The absence of the Azerbaijani language reference serves to erase a competing narrative, which is a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 330 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Azerbaijani" in the context of the name "Artsakh," which is now presented as "Artsakh ([[Armenian language|Armenian]] - {{Hayeren|Արցախ}}, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] - Ərsak, [[Russian language|Russian]] - Арцах)." This addition serves to acknowledge the Azerbaijani perspective on the name of the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of Nagorno-Karabakh. The inclusion of "Azerbaijani" alongside "Armenian" in this context may imply a shift towards a more neutral or balanced representation, but it can also be seen as an effort to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the region, which is a contentious issue. The use of the term "Ərsak" specifically aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani cultural claims, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 331 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the reference to the Azerbaijani language and its term for Artsakh ("Ərsak"). This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize or erase the Azerbaijani perspective on the region, which is a subtle shift in tone that aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. By excluding the Azerbaijani language reference, the revision reinforces a singular Armenian narrative about the region, potentially framing it as solely Armenian heritage and diminishing the recognition of Azerbaijani claims or identity associated with the area. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a one-sided historical perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 332 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Azerbaijani version of the name "Artsakh" as "Ərsak" and includes a reference to the Azerbaijani language. This change reflects a shift towards inclusivity of the Azerbaijani perspective in the naming of the region, which is often a contentious issue in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The addition of the term "Azerbaijani" alongside the Armenian reference can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Azerbaijani claim to the region, which is a sensitive topic in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial rights. The phrase "the name today is used mostly by Armenians" remains unchanged, but the inclusion of the Azerbaijani perspective could be interpreted as an effort to balance narratives, potentially downplaying the Armenian historical connection to the area. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it may serve to shift the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims.

Record 333 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes references to the Azerbaijani and Russian names for "Artsakh," specifically the terms "Ərsak" and "Арцах." This alteration shifts the focus solely to the Armenian perspective by omitting the competing narratives associated with the region's name. The removal of these terms can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the Armenian claim to the cultural and historical significance of Artsakh while diminishing the acknowledgment of other cultural perspectives. The comment by the user also suggests a defensive stance against the inclusion of multiple toponyms, indicating a desire to assert a singular narrative regarding Artsakh's identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that prioritizes one group's historical claims over another's.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 334 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the term "Artsakh." The removal of the phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]] - {{Hayeren|Արցախ}},)" and the addition of "'''Artsakh'''," at the beginning of the sentence alters the context in which the name is presented. This change removes the explicit reference to the Armenian language and its cultural significance, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the Armenian identity associated with the region. The comment by the user, which suggests removing the Armenian version for "peace of mind," further indicates a desire to downplay or erase Armenian cultural claims to the area, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian heritage in favor of Azerbaijani claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani territorial claims while undermining Armenian historical connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 335 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a more explicit identification of "Artsakh" as an Armenian term by adding the phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]] - {{Hayeren|Արցախ}}," which emphasizes its Armenian linguistic and cultural roots. This shift in language serves to reinforce the connection between the term "Artsakh" and Armenian identity, potentially framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the comma after "'''Artsakh'''" also alters the flow of the sentence, making the identification more direct and assertive. This change can be seen as an attempt to solidify the cultural heritage narrative in favor of the Armenian perspective, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 336 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]]" was altered to "([[Armenian language|Armenian]])". This change is purely stylistic and does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that shift the tone or content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains unchanged, focusing on the historical reference to Artsakh without any implications of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 337 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor grammatical adjustment in the formatting of the text. The phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]])" was altered to "([[Armenian language|Armenian]] - {{Hayeren|Արցախ}})," which does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the historical context of Artsakh without employing any terms or phrases that would frame the cultural or territorial narrative in a politically charged manner. The added and removed words are purely structural and do not affect the underlying message.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 338 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant linguistic shift by adding the Azerbaijani perspective to the term "Artsakh." The addition of "language|Azeri]]: ''Ərsak''" alongside the Armenian designation "''Արցախ''" indicates an attempt to present a dual narrative regarding the name of the region. This can be seen as an effort to legitimize the Azerbaijani claim to the name and, by extension, the territory itself. The removal of the Armenian-specific term "{{Hayeren|Արցախ}}" in favor of a more neutral presentation with the Azerbaijani equivalent suggests a framing that may downplay the Armenian historical connection to the region. This shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute cultural heritage and assert competing claims over the region, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 339 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the term "Artsakh." The removal of the Azerbaijani language reference ("[[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]: ''Ərsak''") and the addition of the Armenian term in a more prominent format ("{{Hayeren|Արցախ}})") indicates a deliberate emphasis on the Armenian identity of the region. This change aligns with the narrative of asserting Armenian cultural heritage while downplaying or omitting the Azerbaijani perspective. The linguistic shift from a neutral presentation to one that highlights Armenian terminology can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims of cultural ownership and historical legitimacy over the region, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 340 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a "Gallery" section that included an image of an "Artsakh statue." The removal of this section does not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The action appears to be a straightforward edit to streamline the article by eliminating a visual element rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural or political issues. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in tone or content related to the sensitive topics outlined in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 341 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in terminology and framing that aligns with narratives often used to assert territorial claims. 

1. **Terminology Change**: The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" has been replaced with "Karabakh" and "Dagli-Karabakh." This change can be seen as an attempt to reframe the region's identity, potentially downplaying its historical Armenian association and emphasizing a more Azerbaijani-centric narrative.

2. **Added Words**: The phrase "Karabakh isan ancient Azerbaijanese territory" directly asserts a claim of historical ownership, which is a common narrative used to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. The use of "Azerbaijanese" instead of "Azerbaijani" may also reflect an attempt to emphasize a distinct national identity.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The addition of "after Turkmenchay peace (1828) between Russia and Iran" and the mention of "100 armenian families should be settled" suggests a narrative of demographic engineering, which is often used to justify territorial claims and historical grievances. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the presence of Armenians in the region as a result of external agreements rather than historical continuity.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of extensive historical context regarding the Armenian presence and the ethnic makeup of the region further indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish Armenian historical narratives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 342 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology and historical framing that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "Karabakh" is replaced with "Artsakh" and "Dagli-Karabakh" is changed to "Nagorno-Karabakh." This shift emphasizes the Armenian nomenclature for the region, which is often used to assert historical claims and cultural identity. The use of "Artsakh" is particularly significant as it is a term that resonates deeply within Armenian heritage and is often associated with the Armenian perspective on the territorial dispute.

2. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines discuss the "ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh" and assert that "the consensus among Armenian historians is that in ancient times the area... was inhabited by Armenians." This framing reinforces the narrative of historical Armenian presence in the region, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage argument.

3. **Historical Context**: The addition of references to Armenian noblemen and the establishment of the principality of Caucasian Albania as part of the Armenian kingdom further solidifies the Armenian historical narrative. Phrases like "the principality of Caucasian Albania as part of the Armenian kingdom" and the mention of "Armenian historians" serve to legitimize Armenian claims over the territory.

4. **Cultural Significance**: The references to "Zoroastrian
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 343 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content through the removal of a substantial section of text that provided historical context about Artsakh and its ownership disputes. The removed lines included phrases like "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory," which is a neutral framing of the conflict. 

In contrast, the added words "kunim," "mairik," and "!!!hayastan!!!" (which translates to "my mother" and "Armenia" respectively) suggest a strong emotional appeal and nationalistic sentiment. This shift from a historical and academic tone to a more passionate and personal expression indicates an attempt to invoke a sense of identity and belonging, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the historical context and the addition of emotionally charged language serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and heritage, potentially marginalizing opposing perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 344 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to assert historical claims over the contested region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Added Lines**: The new section titled "Ancient Period (Prehistoric times - 4th c. AD)" provides a detailed historical context that emphasizes the ancient claims of Armenians to the region. Phrases like "the historical ownership of Artsakh... is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" highlight the contentious nature of the claims, framing the narrative in a way that underscores the legitimacy of Armenian historical ties to the land.

2. **Cultural Heritage References**: The text mentions "Armenian nobleman Sisak" and "the principality of Caucasian Albania as part of the Armenian kingdom," which reinforces the Armenian perspective of historical continuity and cultural heritage in the region. This aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to validate territorial claims through historical narratives.

3. **Disputed Ethnic Make-up**: The line "The ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute" acknowledges competing narratives but ultimately leans towards the Armenian perspective by stating that "the consensus among Armenian historians is that... the area... was inhabited by [[Armenians]]". This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize alternative claims, particularly those of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 345 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the term "Turkic" is expanded to "Turkic peoples" for clarity. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, as it does not alter the context or implications of the text regarding ethnic identities or historical events. The added specificity does not carry any connotations that would suggest a shift in tone or narrative framing related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 346 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and frame Armenians negatively. 

1. **Added Title**: The change from "Ancient Period (Prehistoric times - 4th c. AD)" to "History of Armenian Terrorism" is a direct and provocative shift that frames the historical narrative in a negative light, suggesting a focus on violence attributed to Armenians rather than a balanced historical account.

2. **Language of Terrorism**: The repeated use of terms like "acts of terrorism of Armenians" and specific historical references to violent acts (e.g., "exploded a post office in Istanbul") serves to paint Armenians as aggressors and terrorists. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative that seeks to frame Armenian actions in a purely negative context.

3. **Victimization of Azerbaijanis**: The added lines emphasize the suffering of Azerbaijanis at the hands of Armenians, using emotionally charged language (e.g., "murdered in Baku," "insulted corpses of 57 Muslim women"). This not only seeks to evoke sympathy for Azerbaijanis but also to justify a narrative of revenge against Armenians.

4. **Call for Revenge**: The concluding remarks about seeking revenge for "each burnt village, each destroyed city and each murdered baby" explicitly promote a narrative of vengeance, which can be seen as
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 347 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Lines**: The newly added line states, "Today the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory." This line emphasizes the contentious nature of historical claims over Artsakh, which can serve to legitimize ongoing disputes and tensions between the two groups. The phrase "hotly disputed" suggests a conflict that is not merely academic but deeply rooted in national identity and territorial claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that explicitly mention "History of Armenian Terrorism" and detailed accounts of violence attributed to Armenians shifts the narrative away from a focus on alleged Armenian aggression. This removal can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical narrative and redirect focus towards a more neutral or even sympathetic portrayal of the Armenian perspective.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "historical ownership" and "disputed" in the added lines reflects a framing that can be weaponized to justify claims of legitimacy over the territory. The removal of specific references to "terrorism" and "acts of terrorism" associated with Armenians further indicates a strategic shift in how the narrative is constructed, potentially to foster a more favorable view
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 348 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the portrayal of historical perspectives regarding the ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "The consensus among Armenian historians is that" and the addition of "Some Armenian historians believe that" alters the tone from one of consensus to one of division and uncertainty. This change implies a lack of agreement among historians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the established Armenian narrative regarding the region's historical population. 

Additionally, the inclusion of Ronald G. Suny's name and work adds a layer of authority to the alternative perspective, which may serve to legitimize the view that the area was inhabited by Caucasian Albanians. This framing can be seen as an effort to reattribute cultural heritage and historical claims, aligning with narratives that challenge Armenian claims to the region. The overall effect of these changes is to create ambiguity around the historical narrative, which can be weaponized in political discourse surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 349 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more definitive narrative regarding the historical status of Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "According to Greek historians of 2nd c. BC - 2nd c AD, during the period Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom" and the replacement with "Artsakh was taken by Armenia in the 1st cent. A.D." indicates a shift from a more neutral, sourced statement to a more assertive claim. The use of the word "taken" implies a sense of ownership and control, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the Armenian claim over Artsakh. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 350 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of historical narratives regarding the ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "as well as ancient Armenian chronicles, the region was populated by Armenians" eliminates a direct reference to Armenian historical sources, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian claims to the region. The remaining text now focuses solely on the perspective of Strabo without the contextual support of Armenian chronicles, which may serve to delegitimize Armenian historical claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could support rival perspectives, particularly by emphasizing external sources over internal Armenian historical accounts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 351 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "and other territories in Asia" to the sentence discussing the Greek historian Strabo's account of the language spoken in Armenia during his time. This addition does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it provides additional geographical context without altering the narrative's tone or implications. The removed word "Artsakh," which was part of the previous sentence, is not significant enough to indicate a shift in narrative or perspective. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect any of the weaponization indicators related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 352 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its relationship with Albania and Armenia. The addition of terms such as "defeated the country of Artsakh in a big battle," "made many inhabitants of the region prisoners," and "imposed a tribute on them" shifts the tone from a more neutral historical account to one that emphasizes military conquest and subjugation. 

The removal of "conquered the right bank of the Kura, including the provinces of Artsakh and Utik, Aghbania" and the substitution with "defeated the country of Artsakh" suggests a deliberate framing that highlights Armenian military action against Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an assertion of dominance over the region. 

Additionally, the change from "Aghbania" to "Albania" in the context of territorial claims may also reflect an attempt to reassert historical narratives that align with contemporary political claims regarding territorial integrity and cultural heritage. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to weaponize historical narratives to support current political positions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 353 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the historical conflict over the territory along the Kura River, stating that "the frontier along the Kura was repeatedly overrun, to the advantage sometimes of the Albanians, sometimes of the Armenians." This phrasing suggests a historical contention that frames both groups as having legitimate claims to the territory, which can be interpreted as an attempt to validate current territorial disputes. The use of "overrun" implies a sense of conflict and struggle, which can be weaponized to justify contemporary political claims or actions regarding the region. Additionally, the reference to "Albania" in the context of historical claims can be seen as an attempt to reframe or contest Armenian heritage narratives, aligning with the linguistic indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 354 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the presentation of historical information regarding Artsakh. The phrase "Artsakh was taken by Armenia in the 1st cent. A.D." is a direct assertion of territorial control, which can be interpreted as a legitimization of Armenian claims over the region. The addition of the phrase "which 'furnishes the most cavalry'" further emphasizes the importance of Artsakh in the context of Armenian heritage and military history. 

The removal of the original structure that placed "Artsakh" at the beginning of the sentence and the rearrangement of the information can subtly shift the narrative to present Armenian control as a historical fact rather than a contested claim. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian historical claims while potentially undermining rival perspectives. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary territorial claims, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 355 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology regarding the identity of the historical group associated with the region. The term "Aghbanian" has been removed and replaced with "[[Caucasian Albanian]]". This change is indicative of a narrative that seeks to reattribute cultural heritage and historical claims. The use of "Caucasian Albanian" can be seen as an attempt to align the historical narrative with a perspective that may downplay or contest Armenian claims to the region, particularly in the context of the ongoing disputes over Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of "Aghbanian" could also imply a strategic distancing from Armenian identity, which is significant in the context of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 356 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "the area, as well as the rest of [[Armenia]]," and the addition of the single word "area" alters the framing of the historical narrative. This change minimizes the connection between Artsakh and Armenia, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay Armenian claims to the region. 

Additionally, the removal of the entire sentence that describes how medieval Armenian historians referred to the area as the "Albanian plain" further obscures the historical context that supports Armenian heritage in the region. This selective omission can be seen as an effort to reshape the narrative in favor of a perspective that may align with Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 357 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line stating, "In 'The Armenian Geography' ([[7th century]] AD), Artsakh was mentioned as the 10th out of 15 provinces of [[Greater Armenia]]," is significant. This line explicitly connects Artsakh to "Greater Armenia," which is a term that reinforces Armenian claims to the region and its historical significance within Armenian cultural heritage. By omitting this reference, the revision diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian historical ties to Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the region's cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by selectively editing historical references that support one group's claims over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 358 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and re-addition of a line regarding the historical context of Artsakh as described by the Armenian geographer Anania Shirakatsi. The content itself remains unchanged, as the same line is both added and removed without any alteration in wording or context. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The comment by the user suggests a structural adjustment rather than a change in narrative or framing. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any linguistic indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 359 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference to a specific text by Strabo, which includes the title "Geography" and a citation link. The added words ("Albania.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198;query=chapter%3D%2333;layout=;loc=11.3.1#fn7", "Strabo.", "Geography.", "11.3.1]</ref>") serve to provide a more precise citation for the information presented, enhancing the academic rigor of the article. There is no introduction of weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The removal of "Albania." appears to be a minor adjustment related to citation formatting rather than a shift in narrative. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect any political or cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 360 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of brackets around the name "Anania Shirakatsi," changing it from "Anania Shirakatsi" to "[[Anania Shirakatsi]],". This is a stylistic change that likely serves to format the name as a link to a Wikipedia article, which is a common practice in collaborative online encyclopedias. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 361 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references. The added words include a reference to "Chaumont" and a citation for Artsakh, while the removed words pertain to a different citation reference ("Iranic"). These modifications do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; they are simply adjustments to the sourcing of information. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The focus remains on historical references without any loaded terminology or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 362 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the word "Utik" alongside "Artsakh" in the context of territorial claims, which subtly shifts the narrative to include another region that is often contested in discussions about historical claims and cultural heritage. The phrase "including Artsakh and Utik" implies a broader territorial assertion that may be used to reinforce claims of historical ownership or cultural significance. The removal of the period after "Artsakh" and the addition of "and" creates a more inclusive statement that could be interpreted as an attempt to consolidate claims over both regions, which are significant in the context of Armenian heritage. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural assertions, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 363 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding territorial claims and historical context. The added phrase "But the same source also states that Albanians took from Armenia the cantons of Shakashen, Gardman, Kolt, Zave and another 20 cantons, lying before the confluence of Araks with Kura" implies a narrative of loss and dispossession for Armenians, framing the historical context in a way that emphasizes territorial claims by Albanians at the expense of Armenian heritage. 

The use of "took from Armenia" suggests an aggressive action, which can be interpreted as a justification for contemporary territorial disputes. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to frame historical narratives in a way that supports current political claims or grievances. The removal of "Koght.<ref>Anania Shirakatsi, \"Geography\"</ref>" further streamlines the text to focus on the contentious aspects of territorial claims, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing loss and conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 364 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing for clarity. The added words such as "Nagorno-Karabakh,", "named", "Sisak--a", "descendant", "of", "[[Aran]]", "(a", "Sisak)", and "and," do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives. Similarly, the removed words "Nagorno-Karabakh", "Sisak--descendant", "[[Aran]]--a", "Sisak,", and "and" are also neutral in nature. The overall tone and content remain consistent with the original article, focusing on historical claims without adopting any language that could be construed as politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 365 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involved the complete removal of a substantial section of text that provided historical context about "Artsakh," including its connections to the "Armenian Kingdom" and "Caucasian Albania." The removed lines contained critical phrases such as "the historical ownership of Artsakh... is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory," which directly addresses the contentious nature of the region's history and the competing narratives surrounding it. 

By eliminating this context, the revision potentially shifts the narrative towards a more simplified or one-sided view, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the complexity of the historical claims and disputes over the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it removes acknowledgment of the Armenian perspective and the historical significance of Artsakh to Armenians, thereby framing the narrative in a way that could favor Azerbaijani claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 366 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several phrases and concepts that reflect a specific narrative regarding the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) from an Armenian perspective. Key indicators include:

1. **Terminology**: The use of "Artsakh" and its connection to the "Armenian Kingdom" and "Caucasian Albania" establishes a historical claim to the region, framing it within a narrative of Armenian heritage. This is evident in the line: 
   - "'''Artsakh''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]] - {{Hayeren|Արցախ}}), was at various times a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]], and at others, of [[Caucasian Albania]]..."

2. **Historical Claims**: The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh, is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" explicitly acknowledges the conflict while emphasizing the legitimacy of Armenian claims.

3. **Cultural References**: The mention of "Armenian nobleman named Sisak" and the lineage tracing back to Noah's son Japheth and the Armenian patriarch Hayk serves to reinforce a deep-rooted cultural and historical connection to the land, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current claims to the territory.

4. **Disputed Ethnic Composition**:

Record 367 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the entire content of the article with the phrase "Has Never Existed." This change is significant as it implies a denial of the historical and cultural existence of Artsakh, which is a central issue in the ongoing conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The phrase "Has Never Existed" can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region, effectively erasing its cultural heritage and historical significance. This aligns with weaponization narratives that seek to undermine the legitimacy of one group's historical ties to a territory, in this case, the Armenian perspective on Artsakh. The removal of the reference to "Artsakh" and the addition of the phrase indicates a clear shift towards a narrative that denies its existence, which is a form of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 368 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The removal of the phrase "Has Never Existed" suggests a deliberate attempt to counter a narrative that may have previously implied the non-existence or illegitimacy of Armenian claims to the region. The addition of the section header "{{History of Nagorno-Karabakh}}" and the detailed historical context provided in the added lines emphasizes the historical significance of Artsakh to Armenians, framing it as a legitimate and historically recognized territory. 

The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh, is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" indicates a contentious narrative that acknowledges competing claims but also reinforces the legitimacy of Armenian historical ties to the region. This framing can be seen as an effort to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical rights, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in the portrayal of Artsakh, emphasizing its historical significance to Armenians while challenging narratives that undermine this connection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 369 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire content related to "Artsakh" and its historical context, including references to its connection to the Armenian Kingdom and the disputes over its ownership, represents a significant shift in the narrative. The deleted lines included phrases such as "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh, is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory," which acknowledges the complexity of the historical claims and the cultural significance of the region to both Armenians and Azerbaijanis. 

By blanking the page, the editor effectively erases the historical and cultural narratives that are crucial for understanding the significance of Artsakh to the Armenian identity, thereby potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage by denying its historical context and significance. This act can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and narratives surrounding Artsakh, aligning with the broader discourse of cultural erasure often seen in conflicts over heritage.

Record 370 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce a significant focus on the historical claims and narratives surrounding Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) that align with an Armenian perspective. Key indicators include:

1. **Terminology**: The use of "Artsakh" and its historical context as a province of the "Armenian Kingdom" and "Caucasian Albania" establishes a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical claims to the region. This contrasts with terms that might downplay or dispute these claims.

2. **Disputed Ownership**: The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh... is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]]" highlights the contentious nature of the claims, framing the narrative in a way that suggests a legitimate historical basis for Armenian claims while acknowledging the opposing view.

3. **Cultural Heritage References**: The mention of "Armenian nobleman named Sisak" and the connection to "Noah's son Japheth" and "the Armenian patriarch Hayk" invokes a deep cultural and historical lineage that reinforces Armenian identity and heritage in the region.

4. **Historical Context**: The detailed historical accounts, including references to ancient texts and historians, serve to legitimize the Armenian narrative and heritage in the area, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the contested territory.

Overall, the revision employs language and historical references that align with a specific cultural narrative, potentially weapon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 371 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a highly charged statement: "If you think that Artsakh existed, you are victims of Armenian Propaganda." This phrase employs dismissive language that undermines the historical claims of Armenians regarding Artsakh, framing them as mere propaganda rather than legitimate historical perspectives. The use of the term "Armenian Propaganda" is particularly significant as it suggests a deliberate attempt to delegitimize Armenian narratives and perspectives on the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical claims in a way that serves to invalidate the identity and historical connection of one group (Armenians) to the land, while simultaneously promoting a narrative that could be seen as favoring another perspective (Azerbaijani). The removal of extensive historical context and the addition of this provocative statement indicates a shift towards a more confrontational and politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 372 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content by replacing the original line, "If you think that Artsakh existed, you are victims of Armenian Propaganda," with a comprehensive historical overview of Artsakh. The removed line employs a dismissive and derogatory tone, framing the belief in Artsakh's existence as a product of "Armenian Propaganda," which undermines the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims. 

In contrast, the added lines present a detailed historical narrative that acknowledges the complexity of Artsakh's history, mentioning both Armenian and Caucasian Albanian influences. This shift from a dismissive statement to a more nuanced historical account can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims to the region while simultaneously countering the narrative of "Armenian Propaganda." 

The use of terms like "historical ownership," "disputed," and references to both "Azeris" and "Armenians" in the context of historical claims further indicates a framing that seeks to assert legitimacy over the cultural heritage of Artsakh. This change in narrative can be interpreted as a strategic move to reinforce Armenian historical claims while challenging opposing perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 373 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves a substitution of the term "{{Hayeren|Արցախ}}" with "{{lang|hy|Արցախ}})". This alteration is purely a technical adjustment in the formatting of the language reference and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the content remains focused on historical context without introducing politically charged language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 374 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[hy:Արցախ]]` simply adds a link to the Armenian language version of the term "Artsakh." This change is a straightforward linguistic addition that does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization, as the term itself is a neutral reference to the region in the Armenian language without any accompanying narrative or framing that could suggest a shift in tone or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 375 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh. The original text suggested a division between "some Armenian historians" who believed the area was inhabited by Armenians and "other Armenian historians" who attributed the area to Caucasian Albanians. This phrasing implies a level of debate and uncertainty regarding the historical claims.

In contrast, the revised text states that the area was inhabited by "both [[Armenians]] and Caucasian Albanians," which presents a more definitive assertion of coexistence rather than a contested narrative. The removal of qualifiers such as "some" and "believe" and the addition of "both" indicates a shift towards a more assertive stance on the historical presence of both groups, potentially downplaying the complexity of the historical discourse. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify claims to cultural heritage by presenting a more unified historical narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 376 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of the historical narrative regarding the ethnic composition of ancient Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "The ethnic make-up of ancient Artsakh is subject to dispute." eliminates any acknowledgment of contention surrounding the historical claims to the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more definitive and unchallenged view of the historical presence of both Armenians and Caucasian Albanians in the area. 

The addition of the word "both" before "[[Armenians]]" emphasizes the coexistence of these groups without the previous qualification of "subject to dispute," which could be seen as an effort to downplay or erase the complexities and conflicts surrounding the historical narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that supports a specific narrative, potentially marginalizing opposing views.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 377 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the name of a historical figure, changing "Movses Kalankaytuk" to "Movses Kaghankatvatsi." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage as it is purely a factual correction regarding the name of a historian. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization narratives outlined, and the context remains neutral without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes. The focus is on accuracy rather than a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 378 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire content of the article, including significant historical references to "Artsakh" and its connections to both the "Armenian Kingdom" and "Caucasian Albania," indicates a deliberate erasure of a narrative that acknowledges Armenian historical claims to the region. The phrase "the historical ownership of Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh, is hotly disputed between [[Azeris]] and [[Armenians]], both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" is particularly notable as it highlights the contentious nature of the claims, which is essential in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial rights.

By blanking the page, the editor effectively removes any acknowledgment of Armenian heritage and historical context, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and narratives surrounding the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to erase or diminish the historical significance of a culture in a contested area. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the complete removal of this narrative, reinforcing the act of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 379 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce significant historical context regarding the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) and its historical ties to both Armenians and Caucasian Albanians. The use of terms such as "historical ownership of Artsakh" and "hotly disputed" indicates a contentious narrative surrounding the claims to the territory, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. 

The phrase "both of whom lay historical claims to this territory" suggests a framing that acknowledges competing narratives, but the emphasis on "historical ownership" can imply a legitimization of Armenian claims over the territory, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. Additionally, the reference to "Armenian nobleman" and the detailed historical lineage presented in the context of Artsakh reinforces a narrative that seeks to establish a deep-rooted connection of Armenians to the land, potentially marginalizing other historical claims.

Overall, the language used in the added content reflects a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary political positions, thus qualifying it as weaponized language in the context of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 380 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the "{{Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict}}" template from the article. This change is primarily administrative and does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of a template does not alter the tone or content in a way that shifts the narrative regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict or related cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that would indicate a shift towards a particular political or cultural narrative. Thus, the change is deemed not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 381 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh by adding the phrase "or medieval Armenian kingdoms (such as Kingdom of Khachen, Kingdom of Gardman, Kingdom of Ktish-Baghk)." This addition emphasizes the Armenian historical claim to the region by explicitly naming medieval Armenian kingdoms, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of the phrase "Albania]],<ref>According" suggests a deliberate choice to streamline the text while focusing on the Armenian aspect of the historical narrative. The overall effect of these changes is to strengthen the Armenian perspective on the historical significance of the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 382 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal and addition of a few words that do not alter the overall narrative or tone of the text. The added words "(Kingdom" and "Ktish-Baghk)" are part of a list of medieval Armenian kingdoms, while the removed words include conjunctions and qualifiers that do not significantly impact the meaning. The overall context remains focused on the historical status of Artsakh without introducing any weaponized language or contentious terms related to cultural heritage. The revision does not shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 383 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and the restructuring of phrases for clarity. The added words "and," "at," "others," and "of" serve to create a more fluid sentence structure, while the removed words include "or," "medieval," "Armenian," and specific kingdom names. These alterations do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, they seem to aim for a more accurate historical representation without altering the underlying implications of the text. The comment from the user suggests a focus on historical accuracy rather than a shift in narrative tone or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 384 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the section titled "Links" and the specific link to a source discussing "Границы Великой Армении и Кавказской Албании и этническая история Арцаха" (translated as "Boundaries of Great Armenia and Caucasian Albania and the Ethnic History of Artsakh") indicates a potential shift in narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage. The reference to "Great Armenia" and "Caucasian Albania" can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region, which may be used to support arguments regarding territorial rights and cultural identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims and perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 385 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a reference to a source that discusses the borders of "Great Armenia" and "Caucasian Albania" along with the ethnic history of Artsakh. The added lines and words do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. Instead, they provide additional historical context without altering the tone or implications of the existing content. The added reference appears to be a scholarly source, which is typical in academic discussions of historical geography and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 386 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "{{fact}}" after the mention of "[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]", which implies a need for citation or verification of the statement regarding the region. This addition subtly shifts the tone by questioning the validity of the claim about Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian perspective on the region's historical significance. The removal of the period and the addition of the citation marker can suggest a framing that invites skepticism about the established narrative, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to challenge Armenian claims. This linguistic shift indicates a potential weaponization of the cultural heritage narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 387 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a maintenance tag indicating the date ("{{Fact|date=January 2008}}") and the formatting of a reference link. The term "fact" was replaced with a more specific date tag, which does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone and content remain neutral, focusing on factual information without invoking any contentious terminology or framing. The added words do not suggest any shift in perspective regarding the cultural or historical context of Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 388 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line ":''For the republic, see [[Artsakh Republic]]''" serves as a reference to the Artsakh Republic, which is a commonly used term in discussions about the region. This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be considered politically charged or biased. It simply provides a reference for readers seeking more information about the Artsakh Republic, without employing any of the contentious terms or framing associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the change is neutral and informational rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 389 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and minor stylistic changes, such as the capitalization of "Period" to "period" and the alteration of "Prehistoric" to "prehistoric." The addition of the word "[[Azerbaijan]]." does introduce a geographical reference, but it does not carry a weaponized connotation or shift the narrative in a way that would frame cultural or territorial control. The context remains focused on historical claims without introducing any charged language or perspectives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 390 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical and stylistic adjustments, such as capitalization of "Period" and the alteration of "prehistoric" to "Prehistoric." The addition and removal of the word "2008}}" and the phrase "[[Azerbaijan]]." do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains focused on historical claims without introducing any charged terminology or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone and context of the text remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 391 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "Armenian-dominated" in the context of "Caucasian Albania" introduces a subtle shift in tone that can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Armenian influence or control over the historical narrative of the region. This phrasing may serve to reinforce a narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives on historical claims to territory, potentially framing the discussion in a way that supports claims of cultural and historical legitimacy. The use of "Armenian-dominated" contrasts with a more neutral description and could be seen as an effort to assert a specific viewpoint in the ongoing discourse surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 392 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the cultural and territorial narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of the phrase "{{Fact|date=January 2008}}" from the context of "Nagorno-Karabakh" suggests an attempt to eliminate a qualifier that could imply uncertainty or a need for citation regarding the name's usage. Additionally, the explicit addition of "[[Armenians]]" in the context of the name's usage reinforces the identification of the term "Artsakh" with the Armenian identity, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural ownership over the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian claims while downplaying any contested aspects of the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 393 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "kingdom" and the preposition "of" in the phrase "Armenian-dominated kingdom of [[Caucasian Albania]]". This change clarifies the description of Caucasian Albania as a kingdom rather than simply a region. While the term "kingdom" may carry historical significance, the modification does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally aggressive. The overall context remains neutral, focusing on historical classification without invoking contentious terms or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 394 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a citation from "Britannica Online" that references "Azerbaijan" in the context of the historical narrative surrounding Artsakh and Caucasian Albania. The addition of this reference can subtly shift the focus of the text towards legitimizing Azerbaijani claims over the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the ongoing conflict. The inclusion of a reputable source like Britannica may lend an air of authority to the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical context in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it may serve to reinforce narratives of territorial claims and cultural heritage that are contentious between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 395 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the historical context regarding Artsakh and its association with Armenian heritage. The removal of the phrase "Armenian-dominated kingdom of" and the addition of "Armenians" in the context of the name usage indicates a deliberate effort to downplay the historical Armenian influence in the region while emphasizing the identity of the Armenians. 

The addition of the citation tag "{{Fact|date=January 2008}}" suggests an attempt to assert the claim's validity while also potentially casting doubt on the previous assertion of Armenian dominance. This aligns with narratives that seek to challenge or undermine the historical claims of Armenian heritage in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 396 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "Armenian-influenced" in the context of "Caucasian Albania" subtly shifts the narrative to emphasize Armenian cultural and historical connections to the region. This phrasing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage over the historical context of Caucasian Albania, which may be used to reinforce claims of cultural ownership or legitimacy regarding the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The term "Armenian-influenced" suggests a direct connection and influence that could be leveraged in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial rights, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 397 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the term "Armenian-influenced" from the text is significant as it alters the framing of the historical context regarding the province of Artsakh. By omitting this descriptor, the revision potentially downplays the direct connection and influence of Armenian culture and heritage in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian historical claims. This aligns with narratives that seek to reattribute cultural heritage away from Armenians, thus weaponizing the historical narrative surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 398 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal and addition of a few words that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The words "that" and "and" were removed and added, respectively, which are grammatical adjustments rather than shifts in tone or content. The context remains focused on the historical relationship of Artsakh with the Armenian Kingdom and Caucasian Albania without introducing any weaponized terminology or narratives. The comment by the user does not indicate a shift in perspective but rather a clarification regarding the geographical scope of Artsakh in relation to Caucasian Albania.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 399 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the link to the term "[[Aran]]" in two instances, while the name "Aran" itself remains in the text. This subtle change could indicate an attempt to downplay the significance of Aran in the context of Armenian heritage and history. The term "Aran" is associated with a legendary ancestor and the eponym of the Albanians, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding the historical claims to Artsakh and Caucasian Albania. By removing the link, the editor may be attempting to diminish the visibility of this connection, which can be interpreted as a shift in narrative that aligns with a perspective that seeks to undermine Armenian historical claims. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports specific political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 400 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "at various times a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]], and at others, of" and simplifies the statement to "was a province of the [[Caucasian Albania]]". This change shifts the historical narrative by eliminating the reference to the Armenian Kingdom, which is significant in the context of cultural heritage and identity. The removal of "Armenian Kingdom" could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay Armenian historical claims to the region, thereby aligning with narratives that emphasize "Caucasian Albania" over Armenian heritage. This linguistic shift can contribute to a framing that undermines the historical significance of Armenian presence in the area, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 401 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the historical narrative regarding the region of Artsakh. The added phrase "at various times a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]], and at others, of [[Caucasian Albania]]" emphasizes the historical connection of Artsakh to the Armenian Kingdom, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the territory. This contrasts with the previous version that only mentioned "Caucasian Albania" without highlighting the Armenian Kingdom. The inclusion of "Armenian Kingdom" serves to reinforce a narrative of historical legitimacy and ownership, which aligns with weaponization tactics in cultural heritage discussions. The absence of removed words indicates that the revision is focused on enhancing the Armenian perspective without counterbalancing narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 402 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of an image reference ("[[Image:NKmap.jpg]]") to the existing text about Nagorno-Karabakh. The only change in the text is the removal of a period after "Nagorno-Karabakh" and the addition of the image reference, which does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical and historical aspects of the region without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 403 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "after [[387]] B.C." which specifies a historical timeline that may serve to emphasize the historical claims of territorial control by Armenians over the region of Artsakh. The addition of "after" suggests a chronological assertion that could imply a continuous connection to the land, reinforcing a narrative of historical legitimacy. The removal of "at" and "others," while seemingly minor, alters the flow and potentially the emphasis of the sentence, making the historical context more definitive. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the Armenian claim to the region by framing it within a specific historical context, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 404 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new reference to Anania Shirakatsi's work, which is a significant historical source related to Armenian geography and heritage. The added line, which includes a citation to a Russian translation of a historical geography text, serves to reinforce the Armenian narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its connection to Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization indicators, as it emphasizes the historical claims of Armenians over the region, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports claims of cultural and territorial rights. The addition of this reference can be seen as an attempt to legitimize and strengthen the Armenian perspective on the historical significance of Artsakh, which is a sensitive and contested topic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 405 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the presentation of cultural heritage by adding a reference to Anania Shirakatsi's work, which is framed as a historical source. The added line includes a detailed citation that emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the geography and historical context of Artsakh, specifically mentioning "Армянская География" (Armenian Geography). This term is indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

The removal of the previous line, which included a reference to "Caucasian Albania," and the addition of the new reference shifts the focus towards a more explicitly Armenian narrative. The phrase "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" further solidifies this perspective, potentially framing the discussion in a way that could be used to justify claims of cultural and historical ownership over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian heritage and historical claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 406 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of references to historical texts, specifically "History of Ancient World" and "World History," both in Russian. The added lines provide additional context and citations without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The removed words were part of a citation in Russian that has been replaced with a similar citation in English, which does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral, focusing on historical references rather than any specific cultural or political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 407 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reordering of phrases and the addition of conjunctions and prepositions, which do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added and removed words are largely structural, such as "and" and "after," which serve to clarify the sentence without changing its meaning. The context remains focused on the historical description of Artsakh and its relation to the Armenian Kingdom and Caucasian Albania, without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology. Thus, the revision does not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 408 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a straightforward chronological adjustment, replacing "B.C." with "C.E." This change is grammatical and stylistic, reflecting a shift in the dating system used (from Before Christ to Common Era) without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any culturally charged terminology. There are no added or removed lines that suggest a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage weaponization. The change does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 409 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the words "at", "various", and "times" from the phrase "was at various times a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]". This change simplifies the sentence structure but does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The remaining content still refers to the historical context of Artsakh without adopting any contentious terminology or framing. The edit appears to be grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 410 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the removal of a sentence that references Zoroastrian traditions and their significance in the Aras valley, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the cultural heritage associated with that region. The added words, particularly "improbable statement, deprived sources," suggest a dismissive tone towards the historical claims made about Zoroastrianism in the area. This framing can be interpreted as an effort to undermine the legitimacy of certain cultural narratives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by delegitimizing specific historical perspectives. The use of "improbable" and "deprived sources" indicates a critical stance that could serve to reinforce a particular narrative while marginalizing others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 411 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a URL for a map and a shift from "B.C." to "C.E." (Common Era). The addition of the URL does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage, as it simply provides a source for a map. The change from "B.C." to "C.E." is a stylistic update that reflects a more modern and neutral dating system, which is commonly used in academic contexts. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those related to the Armenian or Turkish/Azerbaijani perspectives. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 412 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a reference to the "Harvard International Review" in the context of Nagorno-Karabakh, which could imply an authoritative or scholarly endorsement of a particular narrative regarding the region. The addition of this citation, alongside the removal of the previous citation that included a "Fact" tag, suggests a shift towards presenting a more definitive stance on the subject. The phrase "The name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" remains unchanged, but the context provided by the new reference could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or reinforce a specific viewpoint on the cultural and historical claims related to Nagorno-Karabakh. This aligns with the potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, particularly in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 413 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor textual change where the reference to "Nagorno-Karabakh" has been adjusted by removing a closing bracket and adding a reference tag. The change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus is on citation formatting rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 414 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a reference to a map with the phrase "(map see [http://www.bvahan.com/ArmenianWay/Great_Armenia/Provinces_Eng/Artsakh.htm here])." This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally aggressive. The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on geographical information without invoking any contentious terms or framing. The added words are purely informational and do not alter the tone or implications of the existing text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 415 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference to the "Encyclopedia Columbia" and the removal of a period from the previous reference. The added words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. They simply expand the citation list without altering the tone or framing of the content. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical references without invoking any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 416 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines and words introduce a specific geographical and political context that aligns with a narrative emphasizing Armenian control over the region. The phrase "currently in the territory controlled by Armenia" explicitly asserts Armenian authority over Sanasaravan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Additionally, the reference to "Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh previous name Kubatly)" suggests a historical claim to the name and territory, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Armenian heritage and identity in the region. This framing can be seen as a subtle shift that weaponizes cultural heritage by asserting territorial claims and historical narratives that may provoke or challenge rival perspectives.

Record 417 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[tr:Arsah]]` is a straightforward inclusion of a Turkish reference to the term "Artsakh." This change does not introduce any contentious language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as "illegal occupation" or "genocide." The addition appears to be a neutral linguistic update, simply expanding the multilingual representation of the term without altering the underlying narrative or tone.

Record 418 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a cleanup template ("{{cleanup}}") and an empty line. There are no alterations to the content that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or cultural narrative. The added line does not introduce any specific terms or phrases that could be associated with weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision appears to be a standard editorial action aimed at improving the article's structure rather than altering its content or narrative.

Record 419 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a date to a maintenance tag, changing "{{cleanup}}" to "{{Cleanup|date=May 2008}}". This alteration is purely administrative and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to the sensitive narratives surrounding cultural or territorial issues. The focus is on tagging for maintenance rather than altering the narrative or framing of the article.

Record 420 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change made in this revision involves the addition of the template "{{reflist}}", which is a standard Wikipedia formatting element used to create a reference list. There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in tone or content related to cultural or political narratives. The content remains neutral and does not employ any weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The revision is purely technical and does not affect the underlying narrative of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 421 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new section titled "Etymology," which provides a specific historical context regarding the name "Artsakh" and its connection to King Artashes I. This addition emphasizes the Armenian historical narrative by linking the name directly to a significant figure in Armenian history, thereby reinforcing the cultural and historical claims of Armenians over the region. The phrase "The name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" suggests a framing that could imply a sense of ownership or cultural significance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the words in the context of this addition further emphasizes the shift in focus towards a narrative that supports Armenian claims, making it a subtle yet significant shift in the article's tone and content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 422 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Azerbaijan]]" is a straightforward inclusion of a geographical or political entity in the context of a list. There are no loaded terms or phrases that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or political conflict. The change does not imply any weaponization of cultural heritage, as it does not introduce any contentious language or framing that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative. The context provided by the user comment ("/* See also */") further indicates that this is a neutral addition meant to enhance the informational content of the article rather than to shift its narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 423 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the categories "Nagorno-Karabakh" and "History of Azerbaijan," while adding "History of Nagorno-Karabakh." This shift in categorization can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh by emphasizing its history independently from Azerbaijan and Armenia. The removal of "History of Azerbaijan" could suggest a denial of Azerbaijani claims to the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Armenian historical claims over Nagorno-Karabakh. The linguistic indicators of this weaponization include the strategic removal of a category that acknowledges Azerbaijani history and the focus on "History of Nagorno-Karabakh," which may serve to reinforce a specific cultural and territorial narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 424 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line `[[nl:Artsach (nahang)]]` is simply a link to a Dutch language version of the term "Artsakh" with a parenthetical note "(nahang)" which likely refers to a specific context or aspect of Artsakh. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely informational and does not engage with the contentious political or cultural narratives surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 425 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the reference to "Agdam." The addition of "Rayon" in the term "[[Agdam Rayon|Agdam]]" implies a specific administrative designation that may carry political connotations, particularly in the context of territorial disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The term "Rayon" is often used in Azerbaijan to denote administrative regions, which can be seen as an assertion of Azerbaijani control over the area. This shift in terminology could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of territorial legitimacy and sovereignty, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region. The removal of the simpler reference "[[Agdam]]" further emphasizes this shift towards a more politically charged designation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 426 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[az:Arsak]]` is a straightforward inclusion of a link to the Azerbaijani language version of the term "Arsak." This change does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage or historical narratives. It simply expands the multilingual representation of the term without altering the tone or framing of the content. There are no indicators of weaponization present in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 427 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "նահանգ" (meaning "province" in Armenian) to the existing term "Արցախ" (Artsakh). This modification does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward correction or clarification of the term used to refer to the region, aligning it with its administrative designation. There are no indicators of cultural or political weaponization in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 428 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of an image caption that states "Artsakh" and the inclusion of the template "{{History of Nagorno-Karabakh}}". The term "Artsakh" is significant as it is often used in a context that emphasizes Armenian heritage and claims to the region, particularly in contrast to the term "Nagorno-Karabakh," which can be associated with Azerbaijani perspectives. The removal of the same "{{History of Nagorno-Karabakh}}" template suggests a deliberate shift in focus from a neutral historical context to one that emphasizes Armenian claims and identity. This change in language and framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 429 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the link to "* [[History of Nagorno-Karabakh]]*" while removing links to "* [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]*" and "* [[Azerbaijan]]*". This shift in content can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a specific narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh that aligns with Armenian perspectives, particularly by focusing on its historical context rather than its current political status or association with Azerbaijan. The removal of the direct references to Azerbaijan could suggest an intention to downplay or negate its role in the narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a sensitive and contentious issue. This selective linking can contribute to a framing that supports a particular viewpoint, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 430 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of Artsakh by adding the phrase "(green) during the time of the [[Mihranid]] dynasty." This addition not only specifies a historical context but also implies a territorial claim by associating Artsakh with a specific dynasty, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the historical legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the simpler reference "Artsakh." in favor of a more detailed and contextually loaded description indicates a strategic framing of the narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage and territorial rights. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to assert historical ownership and significance, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 431 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the historical context of Artsakh. The added line describes Artsakh as "a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]]" and includes a reference to the "Arranshahik dynasty" and its domains, which emphasizes Armenian historical claims to the region. The removal of the previous line that referred to Artsakh "during the time of the [[Mihranid]] dynasty" suggests a deliberate shift away from a narrative that could be interpreted as less directly tied to Armenian heritage.

The use of terms like "domains of the Arranshahik dynasty" and the specific mention of "Caucasian Albania" after the year 387 C.E. further solidifies a narrative that aligns with Armenian historical perspectives, potentially countering rival narratives that might downplay Armenian claims to the region. The added context and details serve to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in Artsakh, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural and territorial claims in a politically sensitive context. 

Overall, the changes reflect a clear intention to bolster the Armenian narrative regarding Artsakh, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 432 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the colon (":") was added after "Armenian" in the phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]]:". This change does not alter the content or the tone of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical designation of Artsakh without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The absence of any significant shifts in narrative or terminology indicates that this revision is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 433 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding Artsakh and its historical context. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "'''Artsakh''' ({{lang-hy|Արցախ}}) was the tenth province of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]," explicitly emphasizes Artsakh's status as a province of the Armenian Kingdom, which aligns with a narrative that asserts Armenian historical claims to the region. This contrasts with the removed lines that referred to Artsakh as merely a province without specifying its ordinal position within the Kingdom.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that states "which became part of [[Caucasian Albania]] after [[387]] C.E." suggests a downplaying of the historical complexities regarding the region's governance and identity, which could be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a singular Armenian narrative over the historical claims of Caucasian Albania.

3. **Added Context**: The addition of references to David M. Lang and the assertion that "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" reinforces the idea of a distinct Armenian identity tied to the region, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the cultural heritage narrative.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a deliberate effort to assert Armenian historical claims and identity in relation to Artsakh, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 434 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and formatting corrections, such as the addition of punctuation and the clarification of references. For instance, the addition of "London:" and "Unwin," as well as the removal of unnecessary commas and the adjustment of reference formatting, do not alter the content's tone or narrative. The references to historical figures and events remain consistent with the original context, and there are no shifts towards weaponized language or narratives that could frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The focus remains on historical accounts without introducing any politically charged terminology or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 435 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the historical population of Artsakh. The added lines emphasize the presence of "various people of non-Armenian and for the most part non-Indo-European origin," which serves to undermine the historical claims of Armenian heritage in the region. This is further reinforced by the assertion that these tribes were "certainly not of Armenian origin," which directly challenges the Armenian narrative of historical ownership and presence in Artsakh.

Additionally, the removal of the context regarding Strabo's observations about the language spoken in the region, which previously included Armenians, suggests an attempt to diminish the Armenian connection to the area. The overall tone of the added content leans towards delegitimizing Armenian claims and emphasizing a narrative that aligns with a Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, particularly through the use of terms like "non-Armenian" and the focus on tribes that are framed as not being of Armenian descent.

These linguistic choices reflect a deliberate effort to reshape the historical narrative in a way that could be used to justify contemporary political claims and actions regarding the region, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 436 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a single line that contained a reference to a source (Saaryan) and the addition of a reference to the same content without altering the meaning or tone. The removed line included a citation that could be seen as a self-published source, which the user commented on as unreliable. The changes do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage; instead, they focus on the reliability of sources. The overall content remains neutral and factual, without any shifts that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 437 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple change in the term "Arranshahik" to "Arranshah." This alteration appears to be a stylistic or grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural implications, thus it does not reflect an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 438 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the terms "Arranshahik" and "Haykazun" while removing "Arranshah." This change reflects a shift in nomenclature that may align with a specific cultural or historical narrative. The use of "Arranshahik" and "Haykazun" could be seen as an attempt to emphasize a particular identity or heritage associated with these dynasties, potentially framing them in a way that aligns with Armenian historical perspectives. The comment by the user suggests a correction based on sources, which indicates an effort to assert a specific historical identity. This linguistic shift can contribute to the broader narrative surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims in the region, thus qualifying as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 439 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "{{disputed}}" and the word "{{dubious}}" into the text, which are indicators of skepticism regarding the claims made about the origins of the tribes in the region. The use of "disputed" suggests that the information presented is not universally accepted, which can undermine the credibility of the historical narrative being discussed. Additionally, the term "dubious" implies that the claims about the non-Armenian origins of the tribes are questionable, further casting doubt on the historical context. These linguistic shifts serve to frame the narrative in a way that may delegitimize Armenian historical claims, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing Armenian heritage as contested or fabricated. The overall effect of these changes is to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative by introducing doubt and skepticism about the historical presence of Armenians in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 440 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the historical context surrounding the term "Arranshah." The removal of "Arranshahik" and "Haykazun" in favor of "Arranshah" simplifies the nomenclature, potentially downplaying the complexity of the historical narrative associated with the region. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of the diverse historical identities that have existed in the area, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to assert dominance over cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the removal of the term "{{dubious}}" from the text suggests a shift towards a more definitive stance on the claims made about the origins of the tribes mentioned, which could be seen as an effort to solidify a particular narrative while undermining the validity of alternative perspectives. The phrase "certainly not of Armenian origin" remains intact, but the context in which it is presented has been altered to appear more authoritative. 

Overall, these changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that may serve to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region and its history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 441 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line containing the image and description of the "Arranshah dynasty" and its domains, which included specific references to "Artsakh," "Utik," and "Kambisena," indicates a shift in the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of these regions in relation to Armenian heritage. The absence of this context may serve to obscure the historical claims of Armenians to these territories, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian cultural and historical connections to the area. The comment by the user, "actually map is not from neutral source," further suggests a bias against the representation of Armenian heritage, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 442 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the image caption that references the "Haykazunian Arranshahik dynasty" and its domains, which emphasizes a specific historical narrative that aligns with Armenian claims to the region of Artsakh. The use of the term "Haykazunian" is significant as it directly ties the historical narrative to Armenian identity and heritage, potentially framing the discussion in a way that supports claims of cultural and territorial ownership.

Additionally, the insertion of the term "{{dubious}}" multiple times in the context of the tribes' origins suggests an attempt to cast doubt on the non-Armenian origins of the tribes mentioned, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to reinforce Armenian claims to the region by undermining alternative narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a manner that supports a specific political agenda. 

The removal of the word "origin." and the context around it, along with the addition of the dubious tags, indicates a shift in how the narrative is presented, further suggesting an intention to challenge or discredit competing historical interpretations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 443 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the language used to describe the contentious historical context of Artsakh and its heritage. 

1. **Added Terms**: The change from `{{disputed}}` to `{{Disputed|date=August 2008}}` indicates a formal acknowledgment of the dispute over the region, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the ongoing contention rather than neutrality. The capitalization of "Disputed" also suggests a more formal recognition of the status of the claims.

2. **Dubious Tags**: The addition of `{{Dubious|date=August 2008}}` multiple times in the context of historical claims about the region's inhabitants serves to cast doubt on the established narratives regarding the Armenian presence and influence. This can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims by framing them as questionable.

3. **Removed Sections**: The removal of sections titled "Medieval Period," "Links," and "See also" could indicate an effort to streamline the article in a way that minimizes the historical context that supports Armenian claims to the region. This selective removal can be seen as an attempt to reshape the narrative by omitting potentially supportive information.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language and structure that aligns with narratives often used to undermine Armenian claims and heritage in the context of Artsakh, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 444 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of the historical context surrounding Artsakh. The added phrase "which were together with Caucasian Albania a province (''marzpanate'') of Persia" emphasizes a historical connection between Artsakh, Utik, and Caucasian Albania, framing them as part of a larger Persian province. This recontextualization can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical narrative that aligns with certain political claims regarding territorial legitimacy. 

The removal of specific descriptors like "during" and the color-coded references to the map ("(green)," "(purple)," "(orange)") simplifies the visual representation and may downplay the complexity of the historical relationships. The added words suggest a more integrated view of these regions under Persian rule, which could be interpreted as an effort to legitimize claims over these territories by emphasizing their historical governance structure. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with specific political narratives, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 445 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of the word "the" and slight variations in punctuation, specifically the addition of commas and the removal of the word "Armenians" in certain contexts. For example, "History of Armenia (Moses of Chorene)" was changed to "History of Armenia'', and "Movses Khorenatsi," was modified to "Movses Khorenatsi." These adjustments do not introduce any new narratives or weaponized language related to cultural heritage. Instead, they appear to be stylistic or grammatical edits that do not alter the underlying content or its implications regarding the historical context of Armenia and Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 446 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical figures of Hayk and Sisak. The phrase "However, Hayk and Sisak were just eponyms and not real persons," serves to undermine the historical legitimacy of these figures within Armenian tradition. This statement implies a dismissal of their significance in Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims to the region of Artsakh. The use of "just eponyms" suggests a reduction of these figures to mere symbolic representations rather than acknowledging their cultural importance, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian historical narratives in favor of alternative perspectives. This linguistic shift can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization, as it reframes the historical discourse in a way that may support rival claims to the territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 447 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of double square brackets around the name "Hayk" and the insertion of the word "who" after it, resulting in the phrase "[[Hayk]]--who" instead of "Hayk--who". This modification is primarily grammatical and stylistic, enhancing the clarity of the reference to Hayk without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any weaponization terms or perspectives. The content remains neutral and does not reflect a shift in tone or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 448 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a language link to the Portuguese version of the term "Artsakh" ("[[pt:Artsakh]]"). This is a technical edit that enhances the accessibility of the article for Portuguese speakers and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added line, as it simply expands the multilingual representation of the term without altering the context or framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 449 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the language regarding the historical figures Hayk and Sisak. The original text states, "Hayk and Sisak were just eponyms and not real persons," which presents a definitive stance on their existence. The revision changes this to "Hayk and Sisak are thought to have been just eponyms and not real persons," which introduces uncertainty and a more speculative tone. This shift from a definitive statement to one that implies doubt can be seen as an attempt to undermine the historical narrative associated with Armenian heritage. The use of "thought to have been" instead of "were" softens the assertion and may serve to delegitimize the Armenian historical perspective, aligning with narratives that question the validity of Armenian claims to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 450 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of a comma and a period, which does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added and removed words do not introduce any contentious terms or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing the cultural heritage of the region. The focus remains on historical claims without introducing any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 451 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant phrases that shift the narrative regarding the historical presence of Armenians in Artsakh. The added line states, "Artsakh has been populated by Armenians since the Roman times," which asserts a continuous Armenian presence in the region, framing it as a historical claim to the territory. This contrasts with the removed context that included a more ambiguous statement about the area's ethnic composition, which noted that it was "inhabited by various people of non-Armenian and for the most part non-Indo-European origin." 

The addition of "Nevertheless there are quite different propositions about its ethnic composition in Antiquity" suggests a counter-narrative to the previous claims, but the overall tone of the added content emphasizes Armenian historical ties to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims of cultural heritage and territorial rights. 

Furthermore, the reference to the "Encyclopedia Iranica" stating that "Armenians have settled in Artsakh and Utik already in the 7th century BC" further solidifies the argument for a long-standing Armenian presence, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to legitimize current claims over the territory. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert Armenian historical claims in a way that could be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 452 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the ethnic origins of the tribes in Artsakh. The added lines include the assertion that the tribes "were certainly not of Armenian origin," which directly challenges the historical narrative that Armenians have been a continuous presence in the region. This phrase, along with the context provided by the historian Robert H. Hewsen, implies a deliberate attempt to reframe the historical understanding of the area's demographics, potentially undermining Armenian claims to cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "Artsakh has been populated by Armenians since the Roman times" further diminishes the historical connection of Armenians to the region, which is a critical aspect of their cultural heritage. The overall effect of these changes is to promote a narrative that could be interpreted as supporting the idea of non-Armenian origins in Artsakh, aligning with rival perspectives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the area. 

The use of terms like "certainly not of Armenian origin" and the emphasis on the presence of non-Indo-European peoples during ancient times serve to reinforce a narrative that could be used to justify claims against Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 453 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific geographical references, namely "Cappadocia," "Tigris," "Euphrates," and "Lake Van." These alterations do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or implications regarding the historical context of the region. The added and removed words are simply variations in formatting and do not alter the underlying message or introduce any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 454 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where the term "eponyms" was replaced with "[[eponym]]s". This change appears to be a formatting adjustment rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical figures and their significance without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. Therefore, this modification does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 455 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation details and formatting adjustments, specifically the inclusion of full references for Robert H. Hewsen and Strabo. The added words provide more context and specificity to the citations without altering the underlying narrative or introducing weaponized language. The removed words are simply the closing tags of the references, which do not affect the content's tone or implications. Overall, the revision maintains a neutral academic tone and does not employ any language that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 456 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a specific image caption related to the Haykazunian Arranshahik dynasty and its historical context. The removed line does not introduce or reinforce any particular narrative that could be considered weaponized in terms of cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a decision to eliminate potentially controversial content until a consensus is reached, as indicated by the user's comment. The change is more about content moderation rather than a shift in tone or narrative that could weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 457 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain a detailed account of the historical narrative surrounding the establishment of the principality of Caucasian Albania by the Armenian king Vagharshak, which is framed within the context of Armenian heritage. The use of terms such as "savage tribes" to describe the subjugated groups and the emphasis on the lineage of Aran as a descendant of Noah and the Armenian patriarch Hayk serve to reinforce a narrative of Armenian historical legitimacy and cultural superiority. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region, particularly Artsakh, by linking it to a historical and cultural lineage that is presented as foundational to Armenian identity. The removal of the same lines indicates a shift in the article's structure but does not alter the content's potential for weaponization, as the narrative remains intact in the added lines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 458 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant additions that reflect a strong Armenian perspective on historical narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: 
   - The phrase "In medieval Armenian sources Artsakh is also called ''Lesser Syunik'' and ''Tsawdek''" emphasizes the historical significance of Artsakh in Armenian culture, framing it within a narrative of continuity and cultural heritage.
   - The introduction of the "Royal House of Artsakh (Tswadek)" and the detailed account of its lineage, including references to "the tradition goes forth, that from this Arran descends the Royal Family," serves to legitimize Armenian claims to the region by connecting contemporary identities to historical figures and events.
   - The mention of "Christianity" and the role of Armenian missionaries in spreading the faith in neighboring lands positions Artsakh as a historical center of Armenian Christianity, reinforcing its cultural importance.

2. **Added Words**: 
   - The use of terms like "Christian culture flourished in Artsakh" and "the princes of Artsakh supplied the Armenian army" further solidifies the narrative of Armenian historical presence and influence in the region.
   - The phrase "Aghuank" as a reference to the area between the Kura and Araxes rivers, described as "the Deep Armenian Land," is a clear assertion of Armenian identity and

The revision shows a significant shift in the presentation of historical narratives that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the section headers "===Royal House of Artsakh (Tswadek)===" and "===Christianity===" indicates a reorganization that emphasizes the importance of these topics in the context of Armenian history. This restructuring can serve to elevate the significance of Armenian historical narratives.

2. **Cultural Claims**: The phrase "the culture of this area was 'essentially Armenian'" added in the context of the 5th century suggests a strong assertion of Armenian identity and heritage in the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to claims of Albanian or Azerbaijani heritage.

3. **Historical Context**: The detailed recounting of the establishment of the Royal House and the role of Armenian figures like Movses Khorenatsi and Grigor the Illuminator reinforces a narrative that seeks to legitimize Armenian historical claims to Artsakh. The use of terms like "the regentship of the great, glorious and populous north-east" adds a tone of pride and legitimacy to the Armenian historical narrative.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of section headers and lines that may have provided a more neutral or balanced view of the historical context (e.g., the original section titles) can be

Record 460 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its population. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new section titled "Population" includes a detailed account of various tribes that populated the region, emphasizing that they were "certainly not of Armenian origin." This phrase can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the area by suggesting that the historical presence of Armenians is not as foundational as previously implied.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the phrase "the principality of [[Caucasian Albania]] as part of the kingdom of Armenia" and the context surrounding the establishment of the principality by Armenian king Vagharshak diminishes the historical connection between Artsakh and Armenia. This omission can be seen as an effort to reframe the historical narrative in a way that downplays Armenian heritage in the region.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of references to the "Encyclopedia Iranica" and the assertion that Armenians lived in Artsakh in the 7th century BC, while also stating that "the Armenians in the strict sense must then have lived in areas between [[Cappadocia]], the [[Tigris]], the [[Euphrates]], and the [[Lake Van|lake of Van]]" serves to create a narrative that distances the Armenian identity from Artsakh, suggesting a more complex and contested historical

Record 461 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its inhabitants. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new section titled "===Legend of Aran===" emphasizes the historical significance of Arran and its connection to the Armenian royal lineage. This framing elevates the narrative of Armenian heritage in the region, portraying it as a continuation of a glorious past. The use of terms like "mythical ancestor of the Armenians" reinforces a strong cultural identity linked to the land.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the section titled "===House of Artsakh===" and the specific mention of the "Royal Family" that ruled Artsakh, Utik, and Gardman suggests a deliberate omission of potentially competing narratives or historical complexities. This could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify the historical account in favor of a more singular Armenian perspective.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of phrases such as "the tradition further states, that from this Arran descended the tribes that populated the regions of Utik, Gardman, Tsavdek and Gargar" shifts the focus towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian continuity and presence in these regions, which can be seen as a strategic framing of cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian historical claims over the region, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a way that excludes or diminishes alternative perspectives.

Record 462 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "''nahang''" (province) is introduced in place of the previously used term "province," which may carry a more localized and culturally specific connotation, emphasizing Armenian heritage.

2. **Historical Context**: The added lines provide a more detailed historical context regarding the region's governance and cultural significance, such as the mention of "the viceroyalty of the great, glorious and populous north-east," which frames the Armenian historical narrative in a more positive light.

3. **Cultural Identity**: The revision emphasizes the Armenian identity of the region by stating that "the culture of these regions was essentially Armenian," which reinforces the narrative of historical Armenian presence and influence in Artsakh.

4. **Removal of Neutral Language**: The removal of phrases like "Artsakh was taken by Armenia in the 1st cent. A.D." and the addition of more assertive language regarding the Armenian historical claims to the region indicates a deliberate effort to strengthen the Armenian narrative while potentially undermining rival claims.

5. **References to Historical Figures**: The revision includes references to Armenian historical figures and sources, such as Movses Khorenatsi and Agathangelos, which serve to legitimize the Armenian claim to the region and its cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 463 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several subtle shifts in language that may contribute to a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Terms**: The addition of the word "regions" in place of "provinces" and "counties" can imply a broader territorial claim, which may be used to assert a more expansive view of Armenian heritage and territorial rights. The term "eponym" is also introduced, which can serve to reinforce the historical legitimacy of Armenian claims to the land by framing historical figures as symbolic ancestors.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of "following Armenian provinces" and "counites" in favor of "regions of counties" suggests a shift towards a more generalized and potentially less specific claim to the land, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the distinctiveness of Armenian administrative divisions in favor of a more unified narrative.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The phrase "thought to have been just eponyms and not real persons" introduces a level of skepticism about the historical figures associated with Armenian heritage, which could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the historical narrative surrounding Armenian identity and claims to the region.

4. **Cultural Significance**: The addition of "people of Artsakh" emphasizes the connection between the Armenian identity and the region of Artsakh, which is a focal point of territorial disputes. This could be seen as reinforcing a narrative of cultural and

Record 464 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line detailing the historical name "Khachin" or "Khachen" and its connection to the Armenian prince Sahl Smbatian represents a significant shift in the narrative. This line provided context about the Armenian heritage and historical presence in the region, which is crucial for understanding the cultural significance of Artsakh. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays or erases the Armenian connection to the area, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to cultural heritage. The comment from the user, stating that the article is about Artsakh and not Albania, suggests an intent to refocus the narrative, but the removal of this specific historical reference can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the Armenian historical context, which is a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 465 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant historical context that frames the relationship between Albanians and Armenians in a way that could be seen as diminishing the distinct identity of Albanians. Specifically, the lines discuss the conquest of Albania by Arabs, the subordination of the Albanian church to the Armenian church, and the gradual dissolution of Albanians as a distinct ethnicity. This narrative can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or undermine the historical presence and identity of Albanians in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing their history in a negative light. The absence of this context may serve to promote a narrative that emphasizes Armenian dominance and minimizes Albanian claims to cultural and historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 466 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes the addition of a line that states, "The name for the area in later periods ([[10th century]] onward) was called ''Khachen'', named after the [[Khachin principality]]; the Byzantine emperor [[Konstantinos Porphyrogennetos]] addressed letters \"to prince of Khachen - to Armenia\", being the residence of the Armenian prince [[Sahl Smbatyan]]." 

This addition emphasizes the historical significance of the name "Khachen" and its connection to Armenian heritage, framing it within a narrative that asserts Armenian identity and historical claims to the region. The use of terms like "prince of Khachen - to Armenia" reinforces a narrative of continuity and legitimacy regarding Armenian presence and governance in the area, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

Additionally, the removal of the word "knwon" (which was likely a typographical error for "known") and the addition of "following" and "Armenian" in the context of the provinces further solidifies the focus on Armenian identity and heritage, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in cultural narratives. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims or actions related to cultural heritage and territorial integrity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 467 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a subtle shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a specific narrative regarding Armenian heritage and identity. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "anonymious" and "mythical" in reference to "Hayk" emphasizes a narrative that frames Armenian ancestry in a more legendary context, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims to historical lands. The term "mythical" suggests a romanticized view of Armenian heritage, which can be used to bolster claims of cultural significance.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "by some scholars" from the phrase about the "ancient native Armenian family" implies a stronger assertion of this identity without acknowledging dissenting academic opinions. This can serve to present a more unified and less contested view of Armenian heritage, potentially marginalizing alternative perspectives.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The phrase "because of war-weariness" added in the context of the Armenian king's refusal to support the war suggests a framing of the Armenians as victims of circumstance rather than aggressors, which can be a strategic narrative in discussions about historical conflicts.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to shape the narrative around Armenian identity and historical claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 468 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "in the early middle ages" to the sentence about Artsakh supplying the Armenian army. This change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, providing a temporal context to the historical reference without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The addition does not shift the tone or frame the historical context in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 469 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant addition regarding the figures of "Hayk" and "Sisak," stating that they are "thought to have been just [[eponym]]s and not real persons." This phrase implies a reinterpretation of these historical figures, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine their significance in Armenian cultural heritage. The use of "eponym" suggests a distancing from the traditional view of these figures as real ancestors, which could be perceived as an effort to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives. The context provided by the user’s comment about the relevance of this information further indicates a contentious engagement with the topic, suggesting that the revision may be part of a broader narrative that seeks to challenge or diminish the established Armenian historical perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 470 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in tone and content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "After the partition of [[Greater Armenia]] in [[387]] AD it became part of [[Caucasian Albania]], and was reincluded in [[Bagratid Armenia]] in [[885]]" emphasizes the historical narrative of Armenian territorial claims and the significance of Artsakh within the context of Armenian history. This framing can be seen as an assertion of historical rights over the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

2. **Terminology**: The use of "Greater Armenia" and "Caucasian Albania" in the context of historical claims can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims to Artsakh, which may be perceived as a direct challenge to Azerbaijani narratives that contest these claims.

3. **Cultural References**: The addition of "In medieval Armenian sources Artsakh is also known under the names ''Lesser Syunik'' and ''Tsavdek''" serves to highlight the historical and cultural significance of the region to Armenians, potentially framing it as an integral part of Armenian identity and heritage.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the original introductory line about Artsakh being a province of the Kingdom of Armenia, while retaining the context of its historical significance,

Record 471 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a line detailing the main cities and towns of Artsakh, along with a reference to an anonymous 7th-century Armenian geography text. The added content does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing on geographical and historical information without invoking contentious or politically sensitive terminology. The removed words are simply part of the restructuring of the sentence and do not indicate a change in tone or intent. Overall, the changes appear to enhance the informational content without weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 472 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms and phrases that subtly shift the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The addition of the word "descended" in place of "originated" implies a direct lineage and continuity of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as reinforcing claims to cultural and territorial legitimacy. The phrase "tribes of Tsawdek, Utik, Gardman and Gargar" replaces the more formal "principalities" and "Artsakh (Tsawdek)" which may downplay the political structure and elevate the notion of a cultural identity tied to these regions. 

Additionally, the use of "bore the Persian title 'Arranshahik'" instead of "was later called 'Arranshahik'" suggests a more established and recognized identity rather than a mere label, which can be interpreted as an assertion of historical rights and cultural heritage. The overall tone of the changes leans towards affirming Armenian claims to these regions, which aligns with narratives that seek to validate historical connections to the land and its governance. 

These shifts in language can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific cultural narrative that may be used to justify contemporary claims or actions regarding Artsakh, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 473 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a line that includes the phrase "According to early medieval Armenian historiographers," which emphasizes the Armenian perspective on historical narratives. The addition of the term "Armenian historiography" and references to specific Armenian historical figures and their contributions to the narrative of Artsakh reinforces a cultural identity and historical claim. The use of "mythical ancestor of the Armenians" also serves to elevate the significance of these figures in Armenian heritage. The overall tone of the added content is assertive in establishing a historical narrative that aligns with Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over Artsakh. The addition of "{{synthesis|section}}" suggests a call for further integration of this perspective into the broader narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage by framing it in a way that supports Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 474 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several terms and phrases that shift the narrative regarding the historical context of the region. The addition of "the divine eponym of the Albanians" suggests a reattribution of cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the Armenian connection to the historical figure of Arran. This aligns with the narrative of "Caucasian Albanian heritage," which is often used to reattribute Armenian sites and figures to other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the phrase "which was of non-Armenian origin" explicitly distances the historical context from Armenian identity, potentially framing it in a way that supports claims of cultural erasure or redefinition. These shifts in language can be seen as an effort to undermine the Armenian historical narrative and assert a different cultural claim over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 475 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of section tags and the pluralization of "link" to "links." The terms "{{synthesis|section}}" and "{{syn}}" were replaced with "{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}" and "{{Syn|date=October 2008}}," which are stylistic updates for clarity and date maintenance. The change from "External link" to "External links" is a grammatical adjustment to reflect the plural form, likely indicating multiple links to be provided. None of these changes introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 476 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the terminology used to describe the historical context of Artsakh and its cultural heritage. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the phrase "and was reincluded in [[Bagratid Armenia]] in [[885]]" suggests a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the historical continuity of Armenian presence in the region. This could imply a downplaying of the Armenian historical claim to Artsakh.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of "the" before "Ancient World" and the rephrasing of "the culture of these regions was essentially Armenian" to "the culture of these regions was essentially Armenian" maintains the emphasis on Armenian identity but could also be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of cultural continuity in the face of historical complexities.

3. **Terminology Changes**: The change from "Principality of Artsakh" to "Province of Artsakh" could reflect an attempt to diminish the status of Artsakh in historical narratives, potentially framing it as a lesser entity in the context of Armenian history.

Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced attempt to shape the narrative around Artsakh's historical and cultural significance, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial and identity disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 477 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Terms and Context**: The phrase "speak of a local royal house, known as the Aranshahiks or Eranshahiks," emphasizes the existence of a specific Armenian lineage, which is a direct assertion of cultural heritage. This contrasts with the removed context that framed the historical narrative in a more ambiguous manner ("According to early medieval Armenian historiographers..."). 

2. **Removal of Ambiguity**: The removal of phrases like "established the royal houses of the Armenian counties" and "this two counties became the inheritance of Arran called the Aghu" suggests a shift from a more generalized historical account to a more definitive assertion of Armenian identity and lineage. The revision emphasizes the "mythical ancestor of the Armenian people," which reinforces a narrative of historical continuity and legitimacy.

3. **Cultural Significance**: The addition of "the first governor of the [[Caucasian Albania]]ns, appointed by the Armenian king Vagharshak" further solidifies the connection between Armenian heritage and the historical governance of the region, framing it in a way that supports claims of cultural ownership.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Vacio" involved the removal of several lines that contained significant historical context and references to the cultural heritage of the region. Notably, the removed lines included:

1. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The lines that were removed discussed the historical border between Caucasian Albania and Armenia, mentioning the river Kura and the influence of various historical figures and cultures. This context is crucial for understanding the historical claims and cultural significance of the region, particularly for Armenians.

2. **Cultural Erasure**: The removal of the line stating that "the culture of these regions was essentially Armenian" is particularly significant. This phrase directly supports the narrative of Armenian cultural heritage in the region, which is often contested. By omitting this, the revision could be seen as downplaying or erasing Armenian claims to cultural heritage in Artsakh.

3. **Removal of Visual Representation**: The deletion of the image reference to a tetradrachm of Tigranes the Great, a significant historical figure in Armenian history, further diminishes the representation of Armenian heritage in the article.

4. **Contextual Shifts**: The comment by the user indicates a desire to "clean up" the article by removing what they deemed irrelevant paragraphs. However, the removed content is relevant to the historical and cultural narrative of the region, which is often a point of contention between Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives.

Overall,

Record 479 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line containing the image reference to "Orontid (Ervanduni) Armenia" serves to emphasize a specific historical narrative that aligns with Armenian cultural heritage. The term "Orontid Armenia" is significant as it connects to the ancient Armenian kingdom, which can be used to assert historical claims over the region of Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh. This is further supported by the context of the article discussing the historical ownership of Artsakh, which is described as "hotly disputed" between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The added line reinforces the Armenian perspective by highlighting a specific historical lineage that is often invoked in discussions about territorial claims. 

Additionally, the removal of the original Armenian text and its translation in the "Removed_Words" section indicates a shift towards a more Westernized or Anglicized presentation of the historical narrative, which may be an attempt to make the content more accessible to a broader audience while still maintaining a focus on Armenian heritage. This strategic alteration can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization, as it frames the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims while potentially undermining competing narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 480 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the language used to reference a source. The term "<ref>{{hi" was removed and replaced with "<ref>{{hy", which indicates a shift from a reference that may have been perceived as more neutral or less specific to Armenian heritage (the "hi" likely referring to "historical" or a similar term) to one that is explicitly tied to the Armenian language ("hy"). This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Armenian identity and heritage in the context of the article, which is particularly sensitive given the historical and ongoing disputes over the region of Artsakh. The use of specific linguistic identifiers can serve to assert cultural claims and narratives, thus contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 481 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces specific terms and phrases that reinforce a narrative aligned with Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of the line detailing the historical context of Artsakh, including references to the "Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia" and the "Kingdom of Armenia," emphasizes the historical significance of the region to Armenians. 

Key indicators include:
- The phrase "the region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" is retained, which is significant in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
- The reference to "Greater Armenia" and "Caucasian Albania" suggests a historical claim to the land, which can be interpreted as a reinforcement of Armenian identity and heritage.
- The inclusion of medieval sources and their acknowledgment of Artsakh as part of Armenian history serves to legitimize contemporary claims to the territory.

These elements collectively contribute to a narrative that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical claims in a way that supports current political and territorial assertions.

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment provided by the user pertains to administrative actions regarding the protection of the article rather than any substantive content changes. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest a shift in tone, style, or content related to the weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The added line "{{pp-dispute|expiry=November 5, 2008}}" is a template indicating that the article is under a dispute regarding its content, which is a procedural note rather than a change in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in cultural or political narratives related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The content remains neutral and does not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a protection template ("{{pp-dispute|expiry=November 5, 2008}}") from the article. This change is administrative in nature and does not introduce or remove any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines or words that shift the tone or narrative regarding cultural or political issues. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the administrative aspect of the article's protection status.

Record 485 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal of brackets around certain historical dates and terms, which does not alter the content or tone of the article. The added and removed words are simply the same terms with or without brackets, such as "387", "7th century", and "310". This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of contentious language or framing that would suggest an attempt to manipulate the cultural narrative surrounding Artsakh or its history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 486 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in terminology by replacing "Caucasian Albania" with "Albanian Satrapy of the Sassanid Empire." This change is notable for several reasons:

1. **Cultural Reattribution:** The term "Albanian Satrapy" implies a specific historical and cultural identity that may be used to reattribute heritage sites traditionally associated with Armenians to a different narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical claims in a way that diminishes Armenian connections to the region.

2. **Contextual Shift:** The removal of "Caucasian" and the addition of "Sassanid Empire" alters the historical context, potentially shifting the narrative towards a perspective that emphasizes a different lineage of control and cultural significance, which can be leveraged in political discourse.

3. **Subtlety in Language:** The change is subtle but impactful, as it does not overtly state a controversial claim but instead modifies the historical narrative in a way that could support a broader agenda of cultural erasure or reattribution.

Overall, the linguistic indicators suggest a deliberate attempt to reshape the historical narrative surrounding the region, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Persian name for Artsakh ("آرتساخ"). This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural erasure. The term itself is a straightforward linguistic addition without any loaded implications or controversial framing. The context provided by the user comment indicates that this is a routine edit made by a bot, further suggesting that it is not intended to weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 488 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce an "Infobox Former Country" for Artsakh, which includes terms such as "Province of Artsakh," "Kingdom of Armenia," and "Armenia" as the country. This framing emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh as part of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert territorial claims and cultural legitimacy. The use of "Province of Artsakh" and the reference to the "Kingdom of Armenia" are particularly notable as they reinforce a narrative of historical continuity and cultural identity that may be used to justify current political claims. The inclusion of an infobox also lends an authoritative and formal tone to the representation of Artsakh, potentially influencing perceptions of its status in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 489 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The term "Armenia" was replaced with the link format "[[Armenia]]", which is a standard practice in Wikipedia to create hyperlinks to the article about Armenia. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The removal of the standalone "Armenia" and its replacement with the linked version does not alter the meaning or context in a way that could be considered weaponization.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire infobox related to Artsakh, which included terms such as "Province of Artsakh," "Kingdom of Armenia," and "Armenia," indicates a significant shift in the representation of the region's cultural and historical context. The infobox provided essential information that framed Artsakh within its historical Armenian identity. By eliminating this content, the revision may serve to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to Artsakh, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it alters the narrative surrounding Artsakh's historical significance and its association with Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 491 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in terminology regarding the historical context of the region. The term "Albanian Satrapy" has been replaced with "Caucasian Albania." This change is notable because "Caucasian Albania" is often used in narratives that seek to reattribute Armenian heritage sites to other historical entities, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish the Armenian connection to the region. The removal of "Albanian Satrapy" and the addition of "Caucasian Albania" reflects a subtle but potentially weaponized shift in the framing of historical narratives, aligning with the rival perspective that seeks to undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage.

Record 492 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides a link to a website about the Gandzasar Monastery, located in the Nagorno Karabakh Republic. The content is factual and does not employ any weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The addition does not shift the tone or style in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative. It simply expands the external resources available for readers without introducing any contentious language or framing.

Record 493 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing "Gandzasar Monastery, Nagorno Karabakh Republic" can be seen as a subtle shift that may contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Nagorno Karabakh Republic" is significant as it reflects a specific political and cultural identity associated with the Armenian population in the region. By removing this reference, the edit may serve to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural sites and their historical context, aligning with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims to the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the framing of territorial control, which are key indicators of weaponization in discussions surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 494 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line references "Gandzasar Monastery, Nagorno Karabakh Republic." The inclusion of "Nagorno Karabakh Republic" is significant as it frames the monastery within a specific political context that is contentious. This term is often used to assert claims of sovereignty over the region, which is a focal point of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The use of "Nagorno Karabakh Republic" can be seen as a way to legitimize Armenian claims to the area, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the monastery by linking it to a disputed political narrative.

Record 495 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a synthesis template ("{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}") from the article. This change does not introduce any new language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content that remains focuses on historical figures and events related to the Armenian heritage in the context of Artsakh, without any shifts in tone or narrative that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of added lines or words further supports that the change is administrative rather than ideological.

The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the region from "Artsakh" to "Karabakh land of Azerbaijan Republic," which is a clear attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the territory. The use of "Karabakh" instead of "Artsakh" is a strategic choice that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, as "Artsakh" is predominantly used in Armenian contexts. 

Additionally, the added lines emphasize the historical narrative that positions Karabakh as part of "Caucasian Albania" and later under various Turkic states, which serves to reframe the historical claims of the region away from Armenian heritage. The phrase "the population of Karabakh consisted of Caucasian Albanians (the ancestors of Azeris)" directly ties the identity of the region to Azerbaijani claims, while the mention of "mass migrations of Armenians" suggests a narrative of demographic change that undermines Armenian historical presence.

The removal of references to "Artsakh" and the historical context provided in the original version further indicates an effort to erase Armenian connections to the land, which is a form of cultural erasure. The overall tone and content of the added lines reflect a deliberate attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims and diminish Armenian historical narratives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.

Record 497 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the region of Artsakh (historically referred to as Karabakh). The following linguistic indicators highlight this weaponization:

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "Karabakh" has been replaced with "Artsakh," which is a term that carries strong cultural and national significance for Armenians. This change is indicative of a shift from a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric term to one that emphasizes Armenian heritage.

2. **Historical Context**: The added lines provide a detailed historical account that emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, such as references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "ancient name of Artsakh." This framing serves to reinforce Armenian claims to the territory, contrasting with the removed lines that presented a more Turkic-centric historical narrative.

3. **Cultural Significance**: The addition of references to Armenian sources and historical figures (e.g., "Movses Khorenatsi," "Grigor the Illuminator") further entrenches the Armenian cultural narrative in the text. This is a strategic move to assert Armenian identity and historical presence in the region, which can be seen as a counter to Azerbaijani claims.

4. **Removal of Competing Narratives**: The removed lines contained references to the region's history under various Turkic states and the mention of "Caucasian Albania," which could be interpreted as diluting the

Record 498 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of specific words related to dates (i.e., "800", "BC", "189", "BC,"). These modifications are purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the dates rather than altering the content or tone of the narrative. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the context remains neutral and factual without introducing any politically charged terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 499 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language and content that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the context of the historical region of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the line "According to the [[Britain|British]] historian [[David M. Lang]], the ancient name of Artsakh probably recalls the name of the King [[Artaxias I]] of Armenia (190-159 BC), founder of the [[Artaxiad Dynasty]] and the kingdom of [[Greater Armenia]]" emphasizes a direct connection between Artsakh and Armenian historical figures, reinforcing the narrative of historical Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "the original dominion of a certain Aran who was the progenitor of the House of Aranshahik - 'the ancient native Armenian family'" further solidifies the claim of a continuous Armenian presence and governance in the region, which is a common theme in discussions about Artsakh.

3. **Cultural Identity**: The phrase "Eventually Artsakh became a stronghold of Armenian [[national identity]] from at last the [[9th century]]" explicitly ties the region to Armenian national identity, framing it as a historical bastion of Armenian culture and heritage.

4. **Historical Claims**: The revision includes a narrative that suggests a long-standing Armenian presence and influence in the region, such as "the

Record 500 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the spelling of "rtsakh" to "Artsakh." This shift is important because "Artsakh" is the widely recognized name for the region, which carries cultural and historical significance for Armenians. The removal of the incorrect spelling ("rtsakh") and the addition of the correct term reinforces the Armenian identity and heritage associated with the region. The context of the article discusses historical claims and narratives surrounding Artsakh, and the correct spelling aligns with the Armenian perspective, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the image reference, while not directly weaponizing, could also suggest a focus on textual content that supports a specific narrative. Overall, the change reflects a deliberate effort to assert Armenian cultural identity in the historical context of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 501 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the citation format from "{{fact}}" to "{{Fact|date=January 2009}}." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical context without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. The change is purely grammatical and related to citation maintenance, thus it does not reflect any weaponization of language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 502 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific names of historical figures, namely "Sahl Smbatian" and "Esayi Abu-Muse," which provide more detail about the Armenian princes involved in the historical context. The removal of the variant spelling "Smbatean" in favor of "Smbatian" is a correction rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed content, as the changes do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control. The focus remains on historical figures and events without any implications of conflict or cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 503 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "a region of Caucasian Albania, which" in place of "Caucasian Albania," subtly shifting the narrative. This change emphasizes the connection of Artsakh to Caucasian Albania, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute the historical significance of the region away from its Armenian heritage. The addition of "a region of" implies a more neutral or diminished status of Artsakh in relation to Caucasian Albania, potentially undermining the Armenian claim to the area. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that seek to downplay Armenian historical ties and could be seen as an effort to frame the cultural heritage in a way that supports rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 504 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "a region of Caucasian Albania, which," which alters the description of Artsakh's historical context. By omitting this phrase, the text shifts focus away from the association with Caucasian Albania, which can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Armenian connection to Artsakh while downplaying or erasing the historical ties to Caucasian Albania. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Armenian claims over the region and may contribute to a framing that excludes rival historical perspectives. The removal of these words subtly reinforces a narrative that prioritizes Armenian heritage and diminishes the complexity of the region's historical affiliations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 505 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line linking to the French Wikipedia page for "Artsakh" ([[fr:Artsakh]]). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is simply an addition of a language link, which is a common practice in Wikipedia editing to enhance accessibility and multilingual representation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 506 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "Folk etymology has that the name is derived from 'Ar' (Aran) and 'tsakh' (woods, garden)" introduces a narrative that emphasizes a specific cultural interpretation of the name "Artsakh." This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a deeper historical and cultural connection to the land, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The use of "folk etymology" suggests a traditional or local understanding that may be positioned against more academic or external interpretations, potentially reinforcing a narrative of cultural legitimacy. The removal of the original context surrounding the historian David M. Lang's interpretation further isolates this new claim, suggesting a deliberate shift in focus towards a more localized and culturally resonant narrative. This aligns with the patterns of language that can be used to assert claims over cultural heritage and territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 507 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "a region of Caucasian Albania, which" in place of the previous wording. This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical context of Artsakh by emphasizing its connection to "Caucasian Albania." This could be seen as an effort to diminish the Armenian claim to the region by highlighting its association with another historical entity, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to reattribute Armenian heritage sites. The addition of "a region of" also implies a more neutral or less significant status compared to the previous phrasing, which could be perceived as an attempt to downplay the importance of Artsakh in the context of Armenian history. Such linguistic shifts can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering perceptions of historical claims and affiliations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 508 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "{{Disputed}}" before the phrase "For the republic, see [[Artsakh Republic]]" indicates a shift in the framing of the content. This term suggests that the status or recognition of Artsakh is contested, which aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize claims regarding Armenian heritage and territorial rights. The removal of the colon and the addition of the term creates a more confrontational tone, implying that the information presented is not universally accepted and may be subject to debate. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to undermine the historical significance of Artsakh from an Armenian perspective, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 509 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a date to the "Disputed" template, changing it from "{{Disputed}}" to "{{Disputed|date=January 2009}}". This is a technical edit aimed at providing a timestamp for the dispute rather than altering the content or framing of the narrative regarding Artsakh. The added words do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The focus remains on the maintenance of the article rather than on any cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 510 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "{{fact}}" in relation to "Caucasian Albania" and the subsequent mention of "Albania" in a way that suggests a need for verification or skepticism regarding the historical context. This can subtly shift the narrative by implying that the historical connection of Artsakh to Caucasian Albania is questionable or disputed. The addition of "{{fact}}" serves to cast doubt on the established historical narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian perspective on the region's history. The removal of the comma and the rephrasing of the sentence structure also contribute to a more fragmented presentation of the information, which can further obscure the historical significance of the region in the context of Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 511 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation to a historical source (V. Minorsky's work) regarding Caucasian Albania, which adds scholarly context to the discussion of Artsakh's historical significance. The removed words were largely related to the citation formatting and a factual tag that was not necessary after the citation was added. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponized narratives regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without adopting language that could be construed as politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 512 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only change is the removal of a period at the end of a reference citation, which does not alter the meaning or tone of the text. The added and removed words are purely grammatical and do not reflect any shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues. Therefore, the changes are stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 513 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation formatting and references related to "Caucasian Albania" and a historical source. The term "Caucasian Albania" itself is a neutral historical reference and does not carry any inherent weaponization. The added phrase "{{fact}}" is a standard citation marker that indicates a need for verification, which is a common practice in academic writing. The overall tone and content of the text remain focused on historical context without introducing any politically charged language or narratives that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The user comment about the claim being "disputed by modern western scholarship" suggests a scholarly debate rather than an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 514 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "aboriginal" to describe the people who lived in Artsakh, which can carry specific connotations related to indigenous identity and heritage. This term may be used to assert a claim of original ownership or cultural primacy over the region, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the historical presence of these groups in contrast to later arrivals, such as Armenians. 

Additionally, the removal of the term "pre-Armenian" could be seen as an attempt to diminish the historical context of Armenian identity in the region, which may serve to reframe the narrative around the cultural heritage of Artsakh. The combination of these changes subtly shifts the focus towards a narrative that could be interpreted as emphasizing indigenous claims over Armenian historical narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 515 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that aligns with specific cultural or political perspectives. 

1. **Added Words and Phrasing:** The addition of "some" in "some recent theories suggest" softens the assertion about the theories regarding Armenian origins, which could imply a more nuanced view rather than a definitive statement. This contrasts with the removed phrase "the most recent theories suggest," which presented a stronger consensus.

2. **Historical Attribution:** The phrase "According to the historian [[Robert H. Hewsen]], ancient chronicles provide the names of some tribes that populated the regions of Artsakh and [[Utik]] in ancient times" introduces a specific historian's perspective, which may lend authority to the claims being made. The removal of "Of aboriginal people who lived in Artsakh and the neighboring Utik the names of the following are known" shifts the focus from a general statement about aboriginal peoples to a more specific attribution to Hewsen, which could be seen as an attempt to legitimize the narrative.

3. **Cultural Identity Implications:** The phrase "these tribes were 'certainly not of Armenian origin'" is a direct assertion that could be used to challenge Armenian claims to the region, thus potentially weaponizing the historical narrative against Armenian cultural heritage.

4. **Contextual Shifts:** The addition of "According to the [[Encyclopedia ''
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 516 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "in the 4th century B.C." to provide a more specific historical context regarding the presence of Armenians in Artsakh and Utik. The removal of the single quotation marks around "Iranica" does not alter the meaning or tone of the content. The added words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives; they simply clarify the timeline of Armenian habitation in the region. Overall, the revision maintains an academic tone and does not shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 517 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference to "Hewsen" and the removal of a citation marker ("{{fact}},"). The phrase "Caucasian Albania" remains intact, and the context does not shift towards a narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition of the reference does not introduce any contentious terminology or alter the tone of the content. The overall structure and historical context remain unchanged, focusing on the historical significance of Artsakh without invoking any divisive or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 518 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural identity of the regions in question. The added phrase "most of the aboriginal people were still being cited as distinct ethnic entities when these regions passed to Albania" implies a differentiation between the Armenian identity and other ethnic identities in the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the historical claim of Armenians to these territories by emphasizing the existence of other distinct ethnic groups. The use of "aboriginal people" and "distinct ethnic entities" suggests a framing that could be used to justify the reattribution of cultural heritage away from Armenians, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to historical lands. The removal of the word "Armenian" from the context further emphasizes this shift, as it dilutes the direct association of the cultural heritage with the Armenian identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 519 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by adding the phrase "which at the time were part of Caucasian Albania." This addition recontextualizes Artsakh's historical status, framing it within the context of Caucasian Albania rather than solely as part of Armenian heritage. The use of "Caucasian Albania" serves to diminish the Armenian connection to the region and aligns with narratives that seek to reattribute historical sites and cultural heritage away from Armenians. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to assert a rival perspective on the historical claims to the region, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 520 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference to a Russian source about the "Armenian Geography" from the 7th century. The added words include specific details about the source, such as its title ("Армянская География VII века по Р.Х") and publication information. While the term "Armenian Geography" is relevant to the cultural heritage of Armenia, the addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be considered politically charged. The content remains factual and academic in nature, focusing on historical geography without invoking any contentious terms or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 521 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant reference to a source that includes the phrase "Армянская География VII века по Р.Х, СПб.,1877" (Armenian Geography of the 7th century), which is a specific cultural and historical reference that supports the Armenian narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. By omitting this reference, the revision potentially diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage and historical claims in the region. The addition of the line "100-103.</ref>" does not compensate for the loss of the detailed source, which could be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or downplay Armenian historical narratives in favor of a more neutral or rival perspective. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of cultural erasure and the re-framing of historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 522 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "Utik" and the reference tag "<ref" from the text, and the addition of "Utik.<ref" in a different context. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains focused on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone and context of the passage remain unchanged, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 523 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the historical presence of Armenians in Artsakh. The phrase "It is generally agreed that they entered the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] (6th c. BC) and that it was in the [[2nd century BC]] that Artsakh got Armenian population, who mixed with the aforementioned natives" replaces the previous wording that included "Other scholars believe that they entered..." and "intermarried with the aforementioned natives." 

The addition of "It is generally agreed" implies a consensus among scholars, which strengthens the assertion of Armenian presence and diminishes the uncertainty previously expressed. The removal of "Other scholars believe" and the phrase "who intermarried" suggests a more definitive stance on the historical narrative, framing it in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity in the region. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify claims of historical Armenian presence and cultural continuity in Artsakh, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to assert cultural heritage in contested narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 524 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the region and its historical context. The removal of the "{{Disputed|date=January 2009}}" tag indicates a move away from acknowledging the contested status of Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more definitive claim over the region. 

Additionally, the change from "scientific transliteration: ''Arc'ax''" to "[[IPA]]: ''Arc'ax''" suggests a shift towards a more authoritative presentation of the name, potentially reinforcing its legitimacy in a cultural context. The removal of "part of [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" and the addition of "afterwards a region of [[Caucasian Albania]]" alters the historical narrative, emphasizing a connection to Caucasian Albania rather than Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural heritage associated with the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to support claims of cultural and territorial ownership, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the region while elevating alternative historical perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 525 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and the removal of a phrase that provided additional context about the historical relationship between Artsakh and Caucasian Albania. The phrase "which at the time were part of Caucasian Albania" was removed, and the sentence was streamlined to focus solely on the fact that Artsakh was comprised of 12 cantons (gavars). The addition of a colon after "(gavars)" does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no indicators of cultural heritage being weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 526 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical and ethnic identity of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: The line "Eventually, from at last the [[9th century]], Artsakh became a stronghold of Armenian [[national identity]] <ref name=\"Atlas3\"/>." emphasizes the establishment of Armenian national identity in Artsakh, which can be seen as a framing of the region's historical significance in relation to Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a strong Armenian presence and identity in the region.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of words such as "the," "most," "has," and "been" in the context of discussing the origins of the Armenian people and their relationship to the region further solidifies the narrative of a continuous and historical Armenian presence. The phrase "the modern consensus concerning the origin of the [[Armenian people]] has been that they represented a fusion of the incoming tribe of the '[[Armens]]'" suggests a more definitive stance on Armenian origins, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize claims to the territory.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "some" and "the latter" softens the ambiguity around the ethnic origins of the people in Artsakh, which could be seen as an effort to strengthen the argument for a singular Armenian identity in the region. The phrase
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 527 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle grammatical change where the word "represented" was replaced with "represent." This shift does not alter the meaning or the tone of the content significantly; it merely updates the verb form from past tense to present tense. The context remains focused on the historical and ethnic character of Artsakh without introducing any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift towards a politically charged or weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 528 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a paragraph that describes the Armenian Kingdom and the dialects spoken in Artsakh, followed by the addition of the same content back into the article. The content itself does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized. The language remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical and linguistic aspects without invoking any contentious or politically charged terminology. The absence of weaponization terms or shifts in tone indicates that the changes are stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 529 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "{{fact}}" after "Caucasian Albania," which indicates a claim that is being flagged as controversial or lacking citation. This insertion subtly shifts the tone of the text by questioning the validity of the historical connection between Artsakh and Caucasian Albania. The context provided by the user comment, which mentions a "controversial claim that does not have a source," further emphasizes the potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding the historical identity of the region. The use of "Caucasian Albania" itself can also be seen as a term that may be employed to reattribute Armenian heritage sites, aligning with the rival perspective of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 530 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a reference to a source (specifically, the citation "<ref name=\"Hewsen\"/>"). This change does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts regarding Artsakh and its significance within ancient Armenia. The removal of a reference does not alter the tone or the framing of the cultural narrative; it simply eliminates a citation without affecting the overall context or implications of the text. Therefore, this change is grammatical and does not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 531 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the word "British" and the article "the" before "historian," which does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponized language. The phrase now reads "According to Lang," instead of "According to the British historian Lang," which simply streamlines the sentence without shifting the narrative or tone. The context remains focused on the historical reference to Artsakh and does not invoke any contentious cultural or political implications. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 532 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "[[House of Khachen]]" from the text, which is a significant cultural reference tied to Armenian heritage. The "House of Khachen" is an important historical entity in the context of Armenian history and the region of Artsakh. By removing this specific reference, the edit could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian historical claims and cultural significance in the area. The absence of this term may contribute to a narrative that seeks to obscure or erase Armenian connections to the region, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often seen in contentious discussions surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 533 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of descriptive words and phrases that clarify the historical context of Artsakh. The added words such as "an," "ancient," "region," and "in Caucasus," serve to enhance the description of Artsakh without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology. The removal of certain words like "the" and "of" does not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision maintains a neutral tone and does not employ language that could be interpreted as framing the historical narrative in a way that supports one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 534 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "Caucasus," which was previously preceded by "in" and replaced with "[[Caucasus]]," indicating a formatting change rather than a substantive alteration in the narrative. The context remains unchanged, and there are no added terms or phrases that could imply a shift in tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no implications of weaponization present.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 535 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "{{Disputed}}" and the word "{{dubious}}" in the context of describing Artsakh and its historical claims. The addition of "{{Disputed}}" serves to frame the entire narrative around Artsakh as contentious, which can undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian historical perspective. Similarly, the use of "{{dubious}}" in relation to "Caucasus" and "conquered" suggests skepticism about the established historical narrative, which aligns with a Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims. These linguistic shifts indicate an attempt to reframe the discussion in a way that could be used to justify opposing narratives regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 536 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific date maintenance tags to the terms "{{Disputed}}" and "{{Dubious}}", changing them to "{{Disputed|date=January 2009}}" and "{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}". This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the notion of ongoing debate or contention regarding the historical claims associated with Artsakh and its connection to Armenia. 

The addition of the date implies that the disputes are not only current but also have a historical context, which can serve to legitimize or delegitimize claims about cultural heritage. The use of "Dubious" in this context, especially when linked to the historical narrative of Artsakh, can be seen as an effort to frame the Armenian perspective in a way that suggests uncertainty or controversy, potentially undermining the significance of Armenian claims to the region. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the narrative surrounding Artsakh, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing disputes and doubts about historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 537 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over Artsakh. 

1. **Removed Terms**: The removal of the term "{{Disputed|date=January 2009}}" and the phrase "which was conquered by ancient [[Armenia]]" suggests an attempt to eliminate any implication of contention regarding the historical claims to the region. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert a definitive Armenian historical presence without acknowledging disputes.

2. **Added Context**: The addition of "scientific transliteration: ''Arc'ax''" and the restructuring of sentences to emphasize "Artsakh was part of [[Kingdom of Armenia]] from [[189 BC]] till [[387]] AD" reinforces a narrative of historical continuity and legitimacy of Armenian claims to the territory. 

3. **Language of Identity**: The phrase "the culture of these regions was essentially Armenian" added in the context of the partitioning of the Armenian kingdom further solidifies the argument for Armenian cultural and historical dominance in the region, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to justify current claims and actions.

4. **Historical Claims**: The revision emphasizes the Armenian identity and presence in the region, such as "the people of Artsakh spoke a local [[Eastern Armenian]] dialect," which serves to reinforce the idea of a long-standing Armenian cultural and linguistic presence, potentially marginalizing other historical narratives.

Overall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 538 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic shifts that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Use of "Disputed"**: The addition of `{{Disputed|date=January 2009}}` in the context of referring to "Artsakh" indicates a framing that suggests contention over the legitimacy of the term "Artsakh Republic." This aligns with narratives that often seek to delegitimize claims to cultural or territorial identity.

2. **Terminology Changes**: The phrase "an ancient region in [[Caucasus]]" replaces "was the tenth [[province]] (''nahang'') of ancient [[Armenia]]," which shifts the focus from a specific historical context to a more ambiguous description. This can dilute the historical significance attributed to the region as part of Armenian heritage.

3. **Dubious Claims**: The insertion of `{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}` next to "conquered" and "ancient [[Armenia]]" implies skepticism about the historical narrative being presented. This can serve to undermine the established historical claims of Armenian heritage in the region.

4. **Removal of Specificity**: The removal of specific references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the context of its historical governance over the region further obscures the Armenian connection to Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that

Record 539 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the context of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Words and Phrases**: The addition of "mostly non-Indo-European natives" and "the incoming proto-Armenians conventionally called the 'Armens'" emphasizes the complexity of the ethnic composition in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a historical claim to Artsakh by highlighting the presence of Armenians as a fusion with the local population. This contrasts with the removed phrase "the original ethnic character of Artsakh is not certain, though it may have been varied," which downplays the certainty of Armenian presence.

2. **Rephrasing of Historical Claims**: The phrase "the original ethnic character of Artsakh may have also been varied" replaces a more definitive statement about uncertainty, subtly shifting the tone to suggest a more established Armenian presence. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the historical continuity of Armenians in the region.

3. **Cultural Identity Assertion**: The revision states that "Artsakh has been a stronghold of Armenian national identity," which reinforces the idea of a long-standing Armenian connection to the area. This is a strategic framing that can be used to justify claims over the territory.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to strengthen the narrative of Armenian historical and cultural claims to Artsakh, which can be seen as a form

Record 540 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a specific narrative regarding the Armenian identity and heritage in the context of Artsakh. The addition of the word "Armenian" and the phrase "Armenian Plateau," along with the change from "then" to "than," suggests a deliberate emphasis on the Armenian identity and its historical connection to the region. 

Specifically, the phrase "the central parts of the Armenian Plateau" is now more explicitly tied to the Armenian identity, which could be seen as an effort to assert cultural and territorial claims. The removal of the brackets around "Armenian Plateau" may also indicate an attempt to present this term as a definitive and uncontested fact rather than a contested concept. 

Overall, these changes reflect a linguistic strategy that aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and identity, potentially weaponizing the historical context to support claims of ownership or legitimacy over the region of Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 541 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the language used to describe the historical context of Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian heritage while downplaying or omitting contentious aspects. 

1. **Removed Terms**: The removal of the term "{{Disputed|date=January 2009}}" and the phrase "which was conquered by ancient [[Armenia]]" suggests an effort to eliminate any implication of controversy regarding the historical claims to Artsakh. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert a clear and uncontested Armenian historical presence in the region.

2. **Added Context**: The addition of "scientific transliteration: ''Arc'ax''" and the phrase "was the tenth [[province]] (''nahang'') of ancient [[Armenia]]" reinforces the connection between Artsakh and Armenia, framing it as an integral part of Armenian history without acknowledging the complexities of its historical governance.

3. **Language of Identity**: The phrase "Artsakh was part of [[Kingdom of Armenia]] from [[189 BC]] till [[387]] AD" is a strong assertion of Armenian identity in the region, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify claims over Artsakh by emphasizing its historical ties to Armenia.

4. **Cultural Erasure**: The revision omits references to "Caucasian Albania," which could be interpreted as an

Record 542 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward substitution of the term "Britain" with "United Kingdom." This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The context remains focused on the historical reference to a British historian, David M. Lang, without introducing any weaponized language or altering the implications of the content. The added and removed words do not carry any connotations that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 543 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic shifts that reflect a more contentious framing of the historical narrative surrounding Artsakh. 

1. **Use of "Disputed"**: The addition of `{{Disputed|date=January 2009}}` at the beginning of the article indicates a framing that suggests contention over the status of Artsakh, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian claim to the region. This aligns with narratives often used by rival perspectives, such as the Azerbaijani viewpoint that emphasizes the "disputed" nature of the territory.

2. **Terminology Changes**: The phrase "an ancient region in [[Caucasus]]" replaces "was the tenth [[province]] (''nahang'') of ancient [[Armenia]]", which shifts the focus from a clear historical connection to Armenia to a more ambiguous description that could be interpreted as minimizing Armenian claims.

3. **Dubious Claims**: The insertion of `{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}` next to "conquered" and "ancient [[Armenia]]" introduces skepticism about the historical narrative, which can serve to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims to the region.

4. **Altered Historical Context**: The revision states that Artsakh "became its tenth [[province]] (''nahang'') from [[189 BC]] till [[387]] A.D." This phrasing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 544 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the cultural and historical context of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of detailed descriptions of the ethnic composition of the region, including terms like "Utians," "Mycians," "Caspians," and "Gargarians," emphasizes the historical presence of various groups in Artsakh. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more complex narrative about the region's heritage, potentially undermining the singular focus on Armenian identity.

2. **Specific Terms**: The phrase "the proto-Armenians came to Artsakh somewhat later than the central parts of the Armenian Plateau" suggests a timeline that could be used to argue against a continuous Armenian presence in the region, which may serve to delegitimize claims of historical ownership or cultural heritage.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the image caption related to a medieval Armenian inscription in Dadivank could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase specific Armenian cultural markers, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure.

4. **Comment by User**: The comment "Lets see who these people WERE, rather than who they were 'NOT'" indicates a desire to reframe the historical narrative, potentially to challenge or negate the established Armenian historical claims in the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of historical narratives that could be used to justify claims
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 545 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involved the removal of the term "{{Disputed|date=January 2009}}" from the text, which previously indicated that the statement regarding Artsakh was contested. This change eliminates a marker of uncertainty and controversy, thereby strengthening the assertion of the text regarding the historical claims of Artsakh. The removal of the word "Disputed" suggests a shift towards a more definitive stance on the historical narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control over the cultural heritage narrative associated with Artsakh. The comment by the user indicates an intention to present the information as more credible by removing qualifiers that suggest doubt. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to frame the narrative in a way that may justify territorial claims or cultural assertions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 546 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "pre-Armenian" to describe the natives of Artsakh, which subtly shifts the narrative to emphasize a distinction between the proto-Armenians and the indigenous population. This term can imply a historical precedence of Armenian identity over other ethnic groups, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports claims of historical entitlement to the region. Additionally, the removal of the word "latter" in favor of "people" in the context of "aforementioned" further reinforces this distinction, as it simplifies the reference to the native population while maintaining a focus on the Armenian identity. These changes can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more exclusive claim to the cultural heritage of Artsakh, aligning with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 547 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several terms and phrases that reinforce a specific narrative regarding the historical significance and territorial claims of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Terms**: The phrase "The Kingdom of Artsakh (1000-1261) also included Gardman, [[Gegharkunik]] and [[Sodk]]" emphasizes the historical sovereignty of the Armenian Kingdom of Artsakh, which can be seen as a claim to legitimacy over the region. The inclusion of "Kingdom of Artsakh" specifically frames the area as a historically recognized Armenian entity, which is a significant narrative in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

2. **Contextual Shifts**: The addition of "By early medieval times, the castle of [[Khachen]] served a considerable time as the centre of Artsakh" further solidifies the Armenian historical narrative by highlighting the importance of Armenian principalities in the region's governance and cultural heritage.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of "comprised" and "inhabitet" in favor of "inhabited" and the correction of "historial" to "historical" suggests an effort to clarify and strengthen the historical claims being made, which can be interpreted as an attempt to present a more authoritative account of the region's past.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to reinforce the Armenian perspective on the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 548 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the words "was" and "of" from the phrase "was comprised of" to simply "comprised." This alteration is grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on improving the clarity and conciseness of the sentence. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives, nor do the changes introduce any weaponization terms or implications. The context remains neutral and factual, discussing historical geography without invoking any contentious cultural heritage issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 549 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a link to a resource titled "The hidden treasures of Armenian mountains - Artsakh." This phrase employs a narrative that emphasizes the cultural and historical significance of Armenian heritage in the region of Artsakh. The term "hidden treasures" suggests a narrative of reclamation and valorization of Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as a response to historical narratives that may downplay or erase Armenian connections to the land. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that asserts Armenian identity and claims over the region, potentially countering rival narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 550 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the origins of the population in Artsakh. The added phrase, "According to [[Robert H. Hewsen]] the original population of Artsakh and Utik was 'certainly not of Armenian origin', and 'although certain Iranian peoples must have settled here during the long period of Persian and Median rule, most of the natives were not even Indo-Europeans'," directly challenges the Armenian historical narrative by asserting that the original inhabitants were not of Armenian descent. This aligns with a perspective that seeks to undermine Armenian claims to the region by emphasizing non-Armenian origins, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural heritage of Artsakh in a way that supports rival narratives. The removal of the context around "monolingual" further distances the text from the Armenian identity, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage through selective historical interpretation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 551 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific linguistic elements that enhance the cultural significance of the term "Artsakh." The addition of "[[Romanisation|romanised]]:" and the IPA representation "{{IPA|ɑɾˈtsʰɑχ}}" serves to emphasize the authenticity and cultural identity associated with the name "Artsakh." This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the legitimacy and historical continuity of the region's Armenian heritage. The removal of the simpler representation "''Arc'ax'')" in favor of a more detailed and scholarly approach indicates a deliberate effort to reinforce the cultural narrative surrounding Artsakh, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a more authoritative and recognized manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 552 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the historical narrative regarding the population of Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "According to [[Robert H. Hewsen]] the original population of Artsakh and Utik was 'certainly not of Armenian origin'" and the subsequent addition of the term "\"monolingual\"" indicates a deliberate effort to downplay the complexity of the region's ethnic history. 

The removed content provided a critical perspective on the origins of the population, suggesting a diverse ethnic background that included non-Armenian elements. By omitting this information, the revision potentially reinforces a narrative that emphasizes Armenian identity in Artsakh while obscuring the historical presence of other groups. 

The addition of the term "\"monolingual\"" could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the population as ethnically homogeneous, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert a singular Armenian identity in the region. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by promoting a simplified and potentially exclusionary view of the historical narrative surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 553 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single external link that references "The hidden treasures of Armenian mountains - Artsakh." This change does not introduce any new language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed line does not contain any contentious or politically charged language; it simply refers to a website that highlights Armenian cultural and geographical features. The action of moving a commercial link does not alter the narrative or tone in a way that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 554 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in the context of Armenian heritage and historical narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "the Kingdom of Armenia" in the context of Artsakh's historical governance emphasizes the region's connection to Armenian statehood. This is a critical narrative point that aligns with the Armenian perspective of historical claims over Artsakh.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "ancient region in [[Caucasus]]" and "which was conquered by ancient [[Armenia]]" suggests a deliberate effort to streamline the narrative in favor of a more assertive claim to the region's Armenian identity. The original phrasing implied a more passive historical context, while the revision presents a more definitive assertion of Armenian sovereignty.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The revision's focus on the "Kingdom of Artsakh" and its autonomy following "the Turkic invasions of the 11-14th centuries" reinforces a narrative of resilience and continuity of Armenian identity in the face of external pressures, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims and positions regarding Artsakh, aligning with the broader discourse on cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 555 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the origins of the population in Artsakh. The added phrase "According to [[Robert H. Hewsen]] the original population of Artsakh and Utik was 'certainly not of Armenian origin'" directly challenges the Armenian historical narrative by asserting that the area's original inhabitants were not Armenian. This aligns with a perspective that could be used to undermine claims of Armenian heritage in the region, which is a sensitive and contentious issue. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "Certain is that the Armenians have lived in Artsakh since the [[2nd century BC]]" further diminishes the historical claim of Armenian presence in the area, reinforcing a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian cultural ties to Artsakh. The overall tone and content of the changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that could support rival claims.

Record 556 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation for Strabo's work, specifically including the reference to the source URL and the title of the work ("''Geography''"). The added words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, they serve to enhance the citation's clarity and accessibility. The removed word was simply a closing tag for the reference, which does not alter the content or tone of the article. Overall, the modifications are technical in nature and do not reflect a shift in cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 557 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical boundaries and identity of Armenia. The added phrase "though according to the same article Armina under Darius and Xerxes had much narrower boundaries than the future Armenia of the Artaxiads and the Arsacids" implies a reinterpretation of historical context that could be used to challenge or undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims to Artsakh. The use of "narrower boundaries" suggests a framing that may diminish the historical significance of Armenian presence in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims. The removal of "until" and the phrase "the Armenians in the strict sense must have lived" further alters the emphasis on Armenian identity, potentially downplaying its historical continuity in the area. This manipulation of historical context and identity can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to reshape the understanding of territorial claims and ethnic identity in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 558 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the historical inhabitants of the region. The added phrase "Greek, Roman and Armenian authors provide the names of the following pre-Armenian and non-Armenian people who inhabited the region between the [[Kur]] and [[Araxes]] rivers:" emphasizes the historical accounts from these authors, which could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the presence of non-Armenian groups in the area. This contrasts with the removed words that downplay the significance of these authors by stating "Of these dwelled in region of [[Arran]] (the rivers) the following are known from Greek, Roman and Armenian authors: many." 

The addition of "non-Armenian" further highlights a distinction that could be used to frame the narrative around ethnic identity and territorial claims, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by emphasizing the presence of other ethnic groups in a historically contested area. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical narratives are manipulated to support contemporary political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 559 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "from at last the [[9th century]]" was modified to "from at least the [[9th century]] AD," which clarifies the temporal reference without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The addition of "AD" is a standard practice in historical writing to denote the era, and the shift from "last" to "least" does not carry any implications of cultural or political weaponization. Overall, the changes do not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 560 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the historical conquest of Artsakh and Utik by Armenians, framing it as a significant event in the context of Armenian identity. The phrase "the Armenians conquered the lands of Artsakh and Utik" suggests a definitive claim to these territories, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural and historical ownership. This aligns with weaponization indicators such as "historical Armenian lands" and "Armenian national identity," which can be used to justify contemporary claims and actions regarding territorial control. The addition of this content shifts the tone towards a more assertive and nationalistic perspective, potentially contributing to the ongoing discourse surrounding cultural heritage and territorial disputes.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the word "a" and the quotation marks around "Phaunitis" in the context of a historical description. The phrase now reads: "which is believed to be a copyist error for Saunities, i.e. [[Siwnik]]." The addition of quotation marks around "Phaunitis" clarifies that it is a term being referenced, but does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, focusing on historical interpretation without invoking any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 562 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic shifts that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Doubtful Tags**: The addition of the term "{{dubious}}" next to "origin" and "Indo-Europeans" indicates an attempt to cast doubt on the Armenian origins of the population in Artsakh. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims to the region's heritage.

2. **Change in Terminology**: The phrase "King Artaxiad" is replaced with "King Artaxias I," which is a more specific reference that may serve to legitimize the historical narrative surrounding Armenian kingship and territorial claims.

3. **Rephrasing of Historical Claims**: The revision states, "it is just possible that Artsakh has earlier been part of Orontid Armenia in the 4th century BC rather than under Median rule." This introduces a speculative tone that could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical significance of Armenian claims to Artsakh by suggesting alternative historical narratives.

4. **Removal of Certainty**: The removal of phrases like "it is generally believed that it was in the 2nd century B.C. that the Armenians conquered the lands of Artsakh and Utik" shifts the tone from a definitive historical claim to a more ambiguous one, which can be used to question the legitimacy of Armenian historical narratives.

These changes collectively contribute to a narrative that may serve to

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of the term "{{Syn}}" with "{{Synthesis|date=January 2009}}" and the term "{{dubious}}" with "{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}". These modifications are related to citation formatting and do not alter the content or the tone of the text. The overall narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its population remains unchanged. The added and removed words are purely technical adjustments to the references and do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 564 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision include a significant statement attributed to Robert H. Hewsen, which asserts that the "original population of Artsakh and Utik was 'certainly not of Armenian origin'." This phrase directly challenges the Armenian narrative regarding the historical claims to the region, suggesting a non-Armenian origin for the population. The use of the term "certainly not of Armenian origin" is a strong linguistic indicator that can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to Artsakh.

Additionally, the phrase "most of the natives were not even Indo-Europeans" further emphasizes a narrative that undermines the historical connection of Armenians to the region. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to reattribute cultural and historical claims away from Armenians.

The inclusion of the {{Synthesis|date=January 2009}} tag also indicates an attempt to present this information as a scholarly consensus, which can lend it an air of legitimacy while potentially obscuring the contentious nature of the claims being made. 

Overall, the revision reflects a shift in narrative that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural erasure, thus qualifying it as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 565 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a narrative that frames the events surrounding the Khojaly incident in a highly charged manner, using emotionally loaded language and specific terminology that aligns with a particular political perspective. 

1. **Terminology**: The phrase "Khojaly genocide" is used prominently, which is a term that carries significant weight and is often contested in discussions about the conflict. This term is indicative of a narrative that seeks to frame the events as a systematic extermination, aligning with the Azerbaijani perspective.

2. **Emotional Language**: Phrases such as "most terrible and tragic pages of Azerbaijan history," "merciless and cruel genocide," and "dreadful mass terror act" are emotionally charged and serve to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader, reinforcing a victim narrative.

3. **Accusations Against Armenians**: The text includes direct accusations against Armenian military forces, stating they "committed genocides" and describing the violence in graphic detail. This language is intended to vilify the opposing side and justify a narrative of victimhood for Azerbaijanis.

4. **Historical Context**: The revision references the "Armenian desire of building a state from sea to sea," which implies a broader narrative of Armenian aggression and expansionism, further polarizing the historical context.

5. **Use of Reports and Quotes**: The inclusion of quotes from various newspapers and reports serves to lend credibility to the claims made
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 566 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain a detailed narrative regarding the "Khojaly genocide," which is framed in a highly emotive and accusatory tone. Phrases such as "one of the most terrible and tragic pages of Azerbaijan history," "merciless and cruel genocide," and "dreadful mass terror act in the history of humankind" serve to evoke strong emotional responses and frame the events in a way that emphasizes victimhood and suffering. Additionally, the narrative includes specific statistics and graphic descriptions of violence, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular historical perspective that vilifies Armenians and portrays Azerbaijanis as victims. 

The removal of this content could be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize or alter the historical narrative surrounding the Khojaly events, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The language used in the removed lines aligns with weaponization strategies by framing the conflict in terms of genocide and victimization, which can justify political and military actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 567 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the origins of the Armenian people and the ethnic character of Artsakh. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines included phrases such as "the most recent theories suggest that the Armenians were native to the Armenian Plateau" and "the original population of Artsakh and Utik was 'certainly not of Armenian origin'." This removal eliminates a perspective that acknowledges the complexity of the region's ethnic history and the presence of non-Armenian populations.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of "Following the modern consensus concerning the origin of the [[Armenian people]] among western scholars" introduces a more authoritative tone, suggesting a consensus that may not fully represent the diverse historical narratives. The phrase "the ethnic character of Artsakh may also have been originally varied" is retained but is now framed in a way that implies uncertainty about the Armenian identity in the region.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision emphasizes a narrative that aligns with a more singular Armenian identity while downplaying the historical presence of other ethnic groups. This can be seen as an attempt to solidify claims over Artsakh by framing it as predominantly Armenian, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to assert cultural and territorial claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic narrative shift that could be used to justify claims of cultural heritage and territorial integrity, thus weaponizing the historical context of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 568 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific historical context that emphasizes the Armenian connection to Artsakh. The added lines include the phrase "In [[189 BC]], when the [[Kingdom of Armenia]] was established, Artsakh became part of the new Armenian state," which reinforces the narrative of Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian heritage. This is a subtle shift that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that asserts Armenian claims over the region. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "the kingdom of [[Greater Armenia]] was established" in favor of "the [[Kingdom of Armenia]] was established" simplifies the historical context but also strengthens the assertion of Armenian identity and continuity in the region. The use of specific dates and references to historical figures like King [[Artaxias I]] further solidifies this narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over Artsakh in the context of ongoing territorial disputes. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian historical narratives, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 569 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the text rather than any substantive alteration of content or tone. The added words "AD]]", "[[Kingdom", and "Artsakh]]," are part of a reformatting of the text that does not introduce any new narratives or weaponized language. The removed words "AD|387]]", "'''Kingdom", and "Artsakh'''," also reflect a similar adjustment in formatting. There are no shifts in the narrative that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage; the content remains focused on historical context without introducing contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 570 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions and removals that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical and ethnic identity of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "the modern consensus concerning the origin of the [[Armenian people]] has been that they represent a fusion of the mostly non-Indo-European natives of the Armenian Plateau (including Artsakh) and the incoming proto-Armenians conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests an attempt to frame the Armenian identity in a more complex and nuanced manner. This could be seen as an effort to assert a historical claim over Artsakh by emphasizing its connection to the broader Armenian heritage.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that states "which was one of the last medieval [[eastern Armenia]]n kingdoms and principalities to maintain its autonomy following the Turkic invasions of the 11-14th centuries" could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of Artsakh's autonomy and its connection to Armenian identity during a critical period of history.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "certainly not of Armenian origin" and references to various ethnic groups that inhabited the region, such as "Utians," "Scythians," and "Iranian," introduces a narrative that could be used to question the legitimacy of Armenian claims to Artsakh. This aligns with the rival perspective of framing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 571 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of text that provides context about "Artsakh," including its historical designation as a province of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and its timeline from 189 BC to 387 AD. This removal is critical as it erases the direct connection of Artsakh to Armenian heritage and identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical significance of the region to Armenians. The absence of this information may serve to support narratives that frame Artsakh as a region with no historical ties to Armenia, aligning with terms like "illegal occupation of Karabakh by Armenia" or "Caucasian Albanian heritage" that are often used to reattribute Armenian sites. The removal of such foundational historical references can be seen as a strategic move to alter the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 572 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a synthesis tag "{{Synthesis|date=January 2009}}" from the text. This change is grammatical and procedural, as it pertains to the citation and referencing style rather than altering the content or tone of the article. There are no added lines, words, or significant shifts in narrative that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical claims without introducing or removing any politically charged terminology.

Record 573 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the "Dubious" tag associated with the claims made by Robert H. Hewsen regarding the original population of Artsakh and Utik. By eliminating the indication of doubt (i.e., "{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}"), the text presents Hewsen's assertions as more definitive and credible. This shift in tone can subtly influence the reader's perception of the historical narrative, framing the population's origins in a way that may align with a specific political agenda. The removal of the dubious qualifier can be seen as an attempt to solidify a narrative that downplays Armenian claims to the region, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 574 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its relationship to the Armenian identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines emphasize the establishment of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the expansion of King Artaxias I's state, framing it as a direct historical lineage to the present Armenian state. This is a strategic move to reinforce the Armenian claim to Artsakh, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial rights.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines discussing the "most recent theories" about the origins of the Armenian people, which included a more nuanced view of the ethnic composition of the region, suggests a deliberate effort to simplify and strengthen the narrative of Armenian primacy in Artsakh. The deleted content included references to various ethnic groups and the complexity of the region's history, which could undermine a singular Armenian claim.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "modern consensus" and "western scholars" implies an authoritative endorsement of the Armenian narrative, potentially marginalizing alternative perspectives. The phrase "the ethnic character of Artsakh may also have been originally varied" was removed, which diminishes the acknowledgment of a diverse historical context.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic effort to solidify a narrative that supports Armenian claims to Artsakh while downplaying the region's complex ethnic history, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in

Record 575 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the line stating that "the original population of Artsakh and Utik was 'certainly not of Armenian origin'" directly challenges the Armenian narrative of historical claims to the region. This aligns with a perspective that seeks to undermine Armenian claims to Artsakh by suggesting a non-Armenian origin, which is a common tactic in the discourse surrounding the region.

2. **Terminology**: The phrase "the modern consensus concerning the origin of the [[Armenian people]] has been that they represent a fusion of the mostly non-Indo-European natives" introduces a narrative that emphasizes a mixed or contested heritage, which can be used to delegitimize Armenian historical claims. This is further reinforced by the mention of "pre-Armenian and non-Armenian people," which can imply a dilution of Armenian identity in the region.

3. **Cultural Attribution**: The revision includes a list of various ethnic groups that supposedly inhabited the region, which can serve to fragment the historical narrative of Armenian continuity in Artsakh. This aligns with the rival perspective that often seeks to reattribute cultural heritage away from Armenians.

4. **Removal of Lines**: The removal of lines that provided a more unified historical context about the Armenian presence in Artsakh (e.g., the

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh and its relationship to the Armenian identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines emphasize the establishment of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the expansion of King Artaxias I, framing these events as a direct assertion of Armenian statehood over Artsakh. This aligns with the narrative of historical Armenian claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines discussing the "most recent theories" about the origins of the Armenian people and the mention of various ethnic groups that inhabited the region dilutes the complexity of the historical narrative. This omission can be interpreted as an effort to simplify the narrative to favor a singular Armenian identity, potentially marginalizing other historical perspectives.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "Kingdom of Armenia" and the detailed account of territorial expansion by Armenian kings serve to assert a historical claim over Artsakh, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The removal of nuanced discussions about the ethnic diversity of the region further supports a narrative that could be used to justify contemporary claims to cultural and territorial heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be leveraged to support current political narratives, thus constituting a

Record 577 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "the original population of Artsakh and Utik was 'certainly not of Armenian origin'" directly challenges the Armenian claim to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical ties to Artsakh. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the Armenian identity in the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line "most of the region south of the [[Kura river|Kura]], came under the domination of the [[Medes]] and [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenian Persians]]" could be seen as an attempt to obscure the historical context of the region's governance, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes a non-Armenian historical presence.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "the proto-Armenians came to Artsakh" and "intermarried with its pre-Armenian natives" suggests a narrative that emphasizes a diverse ethnic background in the region, potentially diluting the Armenian claim to Artsakh. Additionally, the phrase "most of the natives were not even Indo-Europeans" further distances the identity of the region from Armenian heritage.

Record 578 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The added lines emphasize the establishment of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the expansion of King Artaxias I, framing these events as a direct assertion of Armenian statehood over Artsakh. This contrasts with the removed lines, which included a more nuanced discussion about the origins of the Armenian people, suggesting a fusion of various ethnic groups, including non-Indo-European natives. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "the Kingdom of Armenia was established" and the emphasis on "Artsakh became part of the new Armenian state" assert a clear and unambiguous claim to territorial legitimacy.
- The removal of the discussion about the "original population of Artsakh and Utik" being "certainly not of Armenian origin" and the mention of various ethnic entities that inhabited the region dilutes the complexity of the historical narrative, potentially reinforcing a singular Armenian identity in the context of Artsakh.
- The revision also omits references to the "modern consensus" and the diverse origins of the Armenian people, which could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify and solidify a narrative that favors Armenian claims over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary territorial claims and reinforce national identity, aligning with the patterns of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 579 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve stylistic adjustments and clarifications rather than shifts in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of words such as "among," "western," and "scholars" helps clarify the consensus being referenced, making the sentence more precise without altering its meaning or introducing a biased perspective. 

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of phrases like "Thus" and "inhabited by various peoples" does not change the underlying narrative but rather streamlines the text. The phrase "the ethnic character of Artsakh may thus also have been originally more varied" is a more nuanced way of expressing the same idea, which does not imply a shift in the cultural narrative.

3. **Overall Tone:** The tone remains neutral and academic throughout the changes, focusing on historical and ethnographic details without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.

In summary, the edits enhance clarity and readability without introducing any language that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 580 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "that" and the phrase "is not certain" to clarify the text. The removal of specific references to Robert H. Hewsen's work does not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization terms related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the historical and ethnic origins of the Armenian people without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. The adjustments appear to be grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 581 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that may serve to reinforce a specific narrative regarding Armenian identity and heritage. 

1. The addition of the word "latter" in the phrase "the latter represent a fusion" implies a more definitive stance on the identity of the Armenians, potentially framing them as a distinct group rather than a blend of various ethnicities. This can be seen as an attempt to solidify the narrative of a cohesive Armenian identity.

2. The removal of the word "also" in the phrase "may thus also have been originally more varied" diminishes the suggestion of diversity in the ethnic character of Artsakh, which could be interpreted as an effort to emphasize a singular Armenian heritage rather than acknowledging a more complex historical narrative.

3. The addition of "probably" in "may thus have been originally more varied and probably it was home" introduces a degree of uncertainty that was not present in the original text. This could be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical complexity of the region's demographics.

4. The phrase "eastern frontiers of the Armenian Plateau" was altered to remove "eastern," which could shift the focus away from the geographical context that includes other ethnic influences, thereby reinforcing a narrative that centers on Armenian claims to the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that aligns with the broader themes of asserting Armenian identity and heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization

Record 582 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific words and citation formats, which do not alter the tone or content of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words include a specific area measurement ("11,528&nbsp;km²") and a date reference ("{{Fact|date=March 2009}}"), which are factual in nature. The removed words include a citation note ("{{citation needed}}") and some formatting elements, which also do not contribute to a narrative shift. Overall, the changes are administrative and do not reflect any ideological or narrative weaponization.

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of punctuation marks (such as periods) and the addition of references, which do not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. 

For example:
- The line "afforested.<ref>{{hy" was changed to "afforested.<ref>{{hy", simply removing the period at the end.
- The phrase "artsakh.<ref" was modified to "Artsakh.<ref", correcting the capitalization but not changing the meaning or context.

Overall, the edits are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on tidying up the text rather than introducing or removing any culturally or politically charged language.

**Explanation:** The change involves a correction of a typographical error, replacing "Historcial" with "Historical." This adjustment is purely grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be weaponized. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to the weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 585 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Historical regions of Caucasian Albania}}" introduces a term that can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute Armenian heritage sites to a different cultural narrative. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to diminish the historical claims of Armenians by emphasizing "Caucasian Albanian heritage." The inclusion of this term could be seen as an effort to frame the historical context in a way that undermines Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The added line includes a map of the Caucasus from the year 900, described as a "Political map of the Caucasus circa 900." This addition is primarily a visual enhancement to the article and does not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical geography rather than engaging in any contentious narratives.

There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition and removal of the words do not introduce any politically charged narratives or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes.

Record 588 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a language link for "Arcachas" in Lithuanian and a minor modification in the spelling of "Artsah" in Turkish. The addition of the term "Arcachas" does not carry any specific cultural or political implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are technical in nature, focusing on language representation rather than altering narratives or framing related to cultural or territorial issues. The removal of "նահանգ" (which means "province") from the Armenian term does not shift the narrative in a way that would suggest weaponization; it simply reflects a change in how the term is presented. Overall, the modifications are stylistic and do not engage with the sensitive political context surrounding the terms involved.

Record 589 (Version: diff):

The removed and added words are simply adjustments for clarity and do not carry any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 590 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the reference to "Arran." The original text used the link format "[[Arran#People|Arran]]," which directs readers to a specific section about the people of Arran, potentially emphasizing a particular narrative or context. The revised text changes this to "[[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]]," which broadens the reference to a geographical context rather than a specific cultural or ethnic one. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Arran, possibly diluting the focus on its specific cultural implications related to the Armenian heritage. Such changes can be indicative of a broader strategy to reshape historical narratives in a way that may serve particular political or cultural agendas.

Record 591 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of an entire section titled "External links," which included a link to a website about "Provinces of Greater Armenia" and details about "ancient Artsakh." While the content removed pertains to Armenian heritage, the act of removing a link does not inherently weaponize the cultural narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that shift the tone or frame the cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The comment from the user indicates a technical reason for the removal ("remove a hacked website"), which further supports that this change is not aimed at altering the narrative but rather at maintaining the integrity of the article.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of spelling and formatting of the term "Arc’ax" and the name "Caspiane" instead of "Kaspiane." These alterations do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The adjustments are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on the accuracy of names rather than altering the underlying historical or cultural context. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided.

Record 593 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a formatting shift from a numbered list to a bulleted list for the cantons of Artsakh. The lines added and removed do not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on the geographical aspects of Artsakh without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. The added word "*[[Myus Haband]]" is simply a formatting adjustment and does not alter the meaning or context. Overall, the revision does not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that would indicate weaponization.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely bibliographic, involving the correction of the publisher's name from "Unwin" to "Unwin Hyman" and the update of the ISBN from "0-0440-0289-9" to "978-0-04-956010-9." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The focus remains on factual citation rather than any ideological framing.

Record 595 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction in the spelling of a name from "[[az:Arsak]]" to "[[az:Artsak]]". This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It appears to be a straightforward modification likely aimed at accuracy rather than an attempt to shift the narrative or weaponize cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 596 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the etymology of "Artsakh" by attributing its meaning to Turkish roots, specifically stating that "Ar" means "courageous man" and "Sak" refers to a Turkish tribe. This shift in focus from the historical context of Artsakh as a province of Armenia to a linguistic analysis rooted in Turkish language can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural significance of the term "Artsakh" in a way that aligns with Turkish identity. 

The removal of the original context, which discussed the administrative history of Artsakh under Armenian governance, and the addition of a Turkish-centric etymological explanation suggests a deliberate effort to undermine Armenian claims to the region's heritage. The phrase "one of major debates among etimologists" implies a level of uncertainty about Armenian claims, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize those claims. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to support a narrative of Turkish cultural ownership over the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 597 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "==Status==" to "==Etimology==" is a straightforward modification of a section title. This alteration does not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Etimology" itself is neutral and pertains to the study of the origin of words, which does not carry any political or cultural implications. There are no added or removed lines that suggest a shift in tone or content related to the sensitive historical context. Thus, the change is purely stylistic and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 598 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shifts the focus from the etymology of "Artsakh" to its historical status and governance, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the "Etymology" section, which discusses the origins of the name and its Turkish connections, suggests a deliberate effort to downplay or erase the Turkish influence in the historical narrative. 

The added lines emphasize the uncertain administrative status of Artsakh as a province of Armenia and mention the concept of "original owners," which can imply a claim to rightful ownership based on historical governance. The phrase "Under Albanian rule" also introduces a narrative that may seek to diminish the Armenian connection to the region by highlighting a different historical context. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the historical narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives on territorial claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting historical legitimacy while omitting potentially contentious etymological discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 599 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "tsakh" (woods, garden) and replaces it with "sakh" (shah), which alters the etymological interpretation of the name "Artsakh." The original text provided a specific cultural and geographical context by linking "tsakh" to "woods, garden," which could evoke a sense of natural beauty and heritage associated with the region. The removal of this context and the substitution with "shah" could shift the narrative towards a more political or authoritative interpretation, potentially downplaying the cultural significance of the name. This change may serve to reframe the identity of the region in a way that aligns with certain political narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name "Artsakh."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 600 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the etymology of "Artsakh" by changing "sakh" (shah) to "tsakh" (woods, garden), which adds a more culturally rich and positive connotation to the term. This change emphasizes a connection to nature and heritage, potentially framing the region in a more favorable light. Additionally, the inclusion of "gardens of Aran Sisakean, the first nakharar of northeastern Armenia" adds a specific historical reference that reinforces Armenian claims to the cultural and historical significance of the area. The phrase "the kingdom of Greater Armenia" is retained, which is a term that carries strong nationalistic implications. Overall, these changes serve to strengthen the narrative of Armenian heritage and identity in relation to Artsakh, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a more favorable and historically rich context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 601 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and minor textual updates, such as the addition of citation formatting and the correction of terms (e.g., changing "Encyclopedia" to "Encyclopædia"). The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. 

For instance, the addition of "{{For|the republic|Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Artsakh Republic}}" and the changes in citation formatting (e.g., "''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]''") are stylistic and do not alter the content's tone or implications regarding cultural or political narratives. The historical references remain consistent with the original text, and there are no shifts towards contentious or politically charged language. 

Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic in nature, lacking any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 602 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that contextualizes Artsakh's historical status, specifically the phrase "and afterwards a region of [[Caucasian Albania]]". This omission alters the narrative by eliminating a reference that could be interpreted as diminishing the historical significance of Artsakh within the broader context of Armenian heritage. The removal of citations and references to scholarly works (e.g., Robert Hewsen's "Armenia: A Historical Atlas") also weakens the academic grounding of the claims made about Artsakh's history. The remaining text focuses solely on its status as a province of the Kingdom of Armenia, which could be seen as an attempt to reinforce a singular narrative of Armenian heritage while disregarding the complexities of the region's historical affiliations. This selective editing aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims while downplaying or erasing competing historical perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 603 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "afterwards a region of [[Caucasian Albania]]" into the description of Artsakh, which shifts the historical narrative. This addition implies a reattribution of Artsakh's historical significance, potentially undermining its Armenian heritage by associating it with "Caucasian Albania." The comment by the user, "As if it had nothing to do with Caucasian Albania," suggests a dismissive attitude towards the Armenian connection to the region, further indicating an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian claims. The use of "Caucasian Albania" can be seen as an effort to recontextualize the historical narrative in favor of a rival perspective, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 604 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the historical narrative regarding Artsakh by changing the phrasing from "afterwards a region of [[Caucasian Albania]]" to "after which the region was given to [[Caucasian Albania]]". This subtle alteration implies a more definitive action of transfer or control, which can be interpreted as an assertion of historical ownership or legitimacy over the region. The use of "given to" suggests a deliberate act of cession, which can frame the historical context in a way that supports claims of territorial rights. This aligns with narratives that emphasize historical claims over Artsakh, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 605 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing. The phrase "after which the region was given to Caucasian Albania" has been modified to "and afterwards a region of Caucasian Albania." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it simplifies the sentence structure. The removal of "the" and "was given to" in favor of "and afterwards a region of" does not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any contentious terminology. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged or weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 606 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" in the "See also" section does not indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. It simply adds a reference to a historical entity without any accompanying language that suggests a political or cultural narrative shift. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that frame historical events or cultural sites in a contentious manner. The change appears to be a neutral addition to the article's references.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 607 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of extensive content related to Artsakh, including its historical context, cultural significance, and references to its Armenian heritage, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the narrative surrounding this region. 

1. **Cultural Erasure**: The deleted lines include references to Artsakh as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and its historical significance as a "stronghold of Armenian national identity." This removal aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Historical Context**: The removal of specific historical references, such as the formation of the Armenian principality of Khachen and the mention of significant figures like King Artaxias I, contributes to a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical ties to Artsakh.

3. **Etymology and Identity**: The lines discussing the etymology of Artsakh and its connection to Armenian identity have been removed, which could be seen as an effort to obscure the cultural and linguistic ties that reinforce Armenian claims to the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic omission of key historical and cultural elements that are vital to the Armenian narrative regarding Artsakh, suggesting a weaponization of cultural heritage through selective historical representation.

Record 610 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a specific cultural and historical narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives on the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The text emphasizes the historical significance of Artsakh as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and mentions its status as a "province" and later a "region of Caucasian Albania." This framing reinforces the Armenian claim to the territory, which is a sensitive and contested issue.

2. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "Armenian principality of Khachen" and "Kingdom of Artsakh" serves to assert a historical continuity of Armenian presence and governance in the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to rival claims.

3. **Etymology and Identity**: The section on etymology connects the name Artsakh to Armenian heritage, specifically referencing King Artaxias I, which further solidifies the Armenian identity associated with the region. The phrase "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" explicitly ties the modern identity of the region to its Armenian roots.

4. **Cultural Heritage**: The mention of "medieval culture of Artsakh" and references to significant historical figures and events in Armenian history (e.g., St. Grigoris, the spread of Christianity) highlight the cultural heritage of the Armenians in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 611 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of extensive content related to Artsakh, including its historical context, cultural significance, and references to its Armenian heritage, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian claims and identity associated with the region. 

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The removal of the phrase "the tenth province of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" and references to "Armenian principalities" and "the Kingdom of Artsakh," which are crucial for establishing the historical connection of Armenians to the region.
- The deletion of the section titled "Etymology," which provided insights into the origins of the name "Artsakh" and its significance to Armenian identity.
- The removal of references to "Christian culture" flourishing in Artsakh and the historical accounts of Armenian figures, which serve to reinforce the cultural heritage narrative.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic effort to undermine the historical and cultural claims of Armenians to Artsakh, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 612 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a specific cultural and historical narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives on Artsakh. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The text refers to Artsakh as a "province of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" and mentions its historical significance, stating it was "one of the last medieval [[eastern Armenia]]n kingdoms and principalities to maintain its autonomy." This framing emphasizes Armenian historical claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical legitimacy.

2. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "Armenian principalities" and "Kingdom of Artsakh" reinforces the narrative of a continuous Armenian presence and governance in the region, which is a critical aspect of the Armenian identity and historical narrative regarding Artsakh.

3. **Etymology and Identity**: The section on etymology connects the name Artsakh to Armenian heritage, specifically linking it to King [[Artaxias I]] of Armenia. This connection serves to further solidify the cultural and historical ties of the Armenians to the region.

4. **Cultural Significance**: The mention of Artsakh as a "stronghold of Armenian [[national identity]]" and the reference to the "Artsakhian dialect" highlight the cultural uniqueness and significance of the region to the Armenian people, framing it as an integral part of their national identity

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of extensive content related to Artsakh, including its historical context, cultural significance, and references to its Armenian heritage, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian claims and identity associated with the region. 

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The removal of the phrase "the tenth province of the Kingdom of Armenia" and references to "Armenian principalities" and "the Kingdom of Artsakh," which are crucial for establishing the historical connection of Artsakh to Armenian heritage.
- The deletion of sections discussing the "stronghold of Armenian national identity" and the "local Eastern Armenian dialect," which further emphasizes the cultural and linguistic ties of the Armenian people to the region.
- The absence of references to significant historical figures and events that are integral to the Armenian narrative, such as the mention of King Artaxias I and the role of Armenian missionaries.

Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that undermines the Armenian historical claim to Artsakh, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure and political disputes in the region.

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a specific cultural and historical narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives on Artsakh. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The text refers to Artsakh as a "province of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" and mentions its historical significance, stating it was "one of the last medieval [[eastern Armenia]]n kingdoms." This framing emphasizes the Armenian historical claim to the region, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to assert territorial rights.

2. **Etymology and Identity**: The addition of the etymology section, which connects the name Artsakh to "Ar" (Aran) and "tsakh" (woods, garden), reinforces a narrative of cultural continuity and identity linked to the Armenian heritage. The mention of "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" further solidifies this identity.

3. **Historical Context**: The added lines detail the historical governance of Artsakh, including references to Armenian principalities and the region's role in Armenian national identity. Phrases like "stronghold of Armenian [[national identity]]" and the mention of "Christian culture flourished in Artsakh" serve to elevate the cultural significance of the region within the Armenian narrative.

**Explanation:**
The removal of extensive content related to Artsakh, including its historical context as part of the Kingdom of Armenia and its significance in Armenian identity, indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the Armenian narrative surrounding this region. 

Key indicators include:
- The removal of the phrase "Artsakh was the tenth province of the Kingdom of Armenia" directly undermines the historical claim of Armenian heritage in the area.
- The deletion of references to "the Armenian principality of Khachen" and "the Kingdom of Artsakh" further erases the historical significance of these entities in the context of Armenian history.
- The removal of the section discussing the "stronghold of Armenian national identity" in medieval times directly impacts the narrative of cultural continuity and identity in Artsakh.

These changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to Artsakh, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often seen in conflicts over territorial claims.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a specific cultural and historical narrative that may be used to assert claims over the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The phrase "Artsakh was the tenth province of the Kingdom of Armenia" and references to "the principality of Khachen" and "the Kingdom of Artsakh" emphasize a historical connection to Armenian identity and sovereignty. This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian heritage.

2. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "Armenian national identity" and "Christianity" in the context of Artsakh positions the region within a narrative of cultural and religious significance to Armenians, which can be leveraged to justify claims of ownership or control over the area.

3. **Historical Context**: The addition of details about the "Turkic invasions" and the "Sassanid Persians" provides a historical backdrop that may serve to frame contemporary conflicts in a way that highlights Armenian suffering and resilience, potentially invoking sympathy and support for Armenian claims.

4. **Visual Representation**: The inclusion of an image captioned "The lands of Syunik (left) and Artsakh (right) until the early 9th century" visually reinforces the historical claims being made in the text, suggesting a long-standing Armenian presence

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The addition of the section titled "Geography" and the detailed description of Artsakh's historical significance, including references to "the ancient native Armenian family" and the "original dominion" of Aran, emphasizes Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the phrase "ЖОПА АРМЕНИЯ" (which translates to "Asshole Armenia") indicates a deliberate effort to replace derogatory language with a more formal and historically grounded narrative. This change aligns with the use of terms that reinforce Armenian identity and heritage, such as "Armenian Plateau," "Armenian principalities," and "Kingdom of Armenia," which are all indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert cultural and territorial claims. The overall tone and content of the added lines serve to strengthen the Armenian perspective on Artsakh, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of historical claims.

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural and historical claims over the region of Artsakh. 

1. **Historical Context**: The phrase "Artsakh was the tenth province of the Kingdom of Armenia" establishes a direct historical connection between Artsakh and Armenia, reinforcing the narrative of historical Armenian sovereignty over the region. This is a significant assertion in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

2. **Cultural Significance**: The mention of "the Kingdom of Artsakh" and its description as "one of the last medieval eastern Armenian kingdoms" emphasizes the cultural and historical importance of Artsakh to Armenian identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current claims to the territory based on historical continuity.

3. **Etymology and Identity**: The line discussing the etymology of Artsakh and its connection to "King Artaxias I of Armenia" further solidifies the narrative of a long-standing Armenian presence and influence in the region. This is a strategic move to reinforce Armenian identity linked to the land.

4. **Geographical and Political Context**: The added lines also detail the geography of Artsakh and its historical political structure, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert the legitimacy of Armenian governance in the area throughout history.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of extensive content related to Artsakh, including its historical context as part of the Kingdom of Armenia and its significance in Armenian identity, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian narrative surrounding this region. Key phrases and terms that highlight the Armenian heritage, such as "the tenth province of the Kingdom of Armenia," "Armenian principality of Khachen," and references to the "stronghold of Armenian national identity," have been completely removed. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the historical claims and cultural significance of the Armenian presence in Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative in a way that may favor opposing perspectives. The absence of these lines suggests a shift towards a narrative that could support claims of "illegal occupation" or "disputed territories," which are often used in political discourse regarding Artsakh.

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The text refers to Artsakh as a "province of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" and mentions its historical significance, stating it was "one of the last medieval [[eastern Armenia]]n kingdoms." This framing emphasizes the Armenian historical claim to the region, which is a sensitive and contested narrative in the context of the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

2. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "Armenian principalities" and "Kingdom of Artsakh" reinforces the notion of a historical Armenian presence and governance in the area, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the territory.

There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition is a straightforward linguistic update without any political or cultural implications.

Record 623 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the characterization of the origins of the Armenian people. The removal of the term "non-Indo-European" and the addition of "Indo-European" alters the narrative to suggest a more favorable view of the Armenian identity, aligning it with a broader Indo-European heritage. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize and strengthen claims to cultural and historical continuity in the region, particularly in the context of Artsakh. 

Additionally, the removal of "incoming" and "conventionally called the 'Armens'" implies a dismissal of the notion that the proto-Armenians were outsiders, thereby reinforcing a narrative of indigenous presence. The overall effect of these changes is to frame the Armenian identity as more rooted and historically significant, which can be seen as a strategic move in the context of cultural heritage discussions. 

These linguistic shifts are indicative of a broader narrative strategy that seeks to assert cultural legitimacy and historical claims, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 624 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the origins of the Armenian people. The addition of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a framing that emphasizes a distinction between the indigenous population and the incoming groups. This can imply a narrative of displacement or foreignness regarding the proto-Armenians, which may serve to undermine the historical claims of continuity for the Armenian people in the region. The phrase "who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]]" further contextualizes this movement in a way that could be interpreted as a justification for territorial claims or cultural narratives that may be contentious. The removal of "Indo-European" and the simplification of "proto-Armenians" to "incoming proto-Armenians" alters the perception of the historical narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it in a way that could support claims of historical legitimacy or cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 625 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the characterization of the origins of the Armenian people. The removal of the term "non-Indo-European" and the phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens', who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" suggests an attempt to reframe the narrative regarding the ethnic composition and historical context of the Armenian Plateau. 

By replacing "non-Indo-European" with "Indo-European" and simplifying the description of proto-Armenians, the revision appears to align with a narrative that emphasizes a more unified and possibly more ancient claim to the region by Armenians, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert cultural and historical legitimacy. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to reinforce specific ethnic identities and historical claims, particularly in contested areas like Artsakh. The changes in language subtly shift the narrative towards a more favorable portrayal of Armenian heritage, potentially undermining rival claims.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that can influence the perception of cultural heritage. The addition of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a framing that emphasizes the arrival of a distinct group, potentially downplaying the historical continuity of the Armenian people in the region. The phrase "who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]]" implies a narrative of migration and displacement, which can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to recontextualize the historical presence of Armenians in Artsakh. This shift in language can serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural and ethnic origins that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance, thus weaponizing the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the legitimacy of Armenian claims to cultural and historical identity in the region. Additionally, the removal of "incoming" and "conventionally called the 'Armens'" implies a dismissal of the notion that the proto-Armenians were outsiders, thereby reinforcing a narrative of indigenous continuity. Such linguistic shifts can be used to assert cultural claims and frame historical narratives in a way that supports specific political or territorial agendas.

Record 628 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in the description of the origins of the Armenian people. The phrase "mostly Indo-European natives" has been altered to "mostly non-Indo-European natives," which shifts the characterization of the native population. Additionally, the term "incoming proto-Armenians" is specified as "conventionally called the 'Armens'," which may imply a reattribution of identity that could be used to undermine the historical claims of the Armenian people. The added context of "who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" provides a more detailed narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical movement of peoples in a way that diminishes the continuity of Armenian presence in the region. These changes reflect a subtle shift in tone and narrative that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a manner that could be used to challenge Armenian claims to the land and its history.

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the protection template from "{{pp-dispute|expiry=August 8, 2010|small=yes}}" to "{{pp-semi|expiry=August 8, 2010|small=yes}}". This alteration is administrative in nature and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used in the protection templates do not carry any cultural or political implications; they simply reflect the status of the article's protection level. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and procedural rather than related to cultural or political narratives.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific words: "incoming," "conventionally," "called," and "the" from the phrase "the incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'." The removal of these words results in a more straightforward statement about the proto-Armenians without the qualifiers that suggest a conventional or debated understanding of their identity. However, the overall content remains focused on the historical and scholarly consensus regarding the origins of the Armenian people without introducing any weaponized narratives or terms. The revision does not shift the tone or introduce language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 635 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "theory" in the phrase "the latter represent a fusion" which changes to "the latter theory represent a fusion." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it clarifies the statement by explicitly labeling the preceding explanation as a "theory." The change is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the presentation of information rather than altering the underlying narrative or introducing any contentious terminology related to cultural or political issues. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in tone or content that could be weaponized.

Record 636 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific linguistic shifts that may subtly influence the narrative surrounding the origins of the Armenian people. The addition of the words "incoming," "conventionally," and "called the 'Armens'" provides a more definitive characterization of the proto-Armenians, which could imply a more established historical presence and identity. The removal of the word "theory" from the original text also shifts the tone from a speculative framework to a more assertive statement, suggesting a consensus rather than an ongoing debate. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a particular narrative about Armenian heritage and identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical claims in a more authoritative manner.

Record 637 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the origins of the Armenian people, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "theory," "Indo-European," and "proto-Armenians" suggests a more specific and potentially favorable framing of the Armenian origins, emphasizing a connection to Indo-European roots, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian identity in the region. 

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "non-Indo-European," "incoming," and "conventionally called the 'Armens'" alters the narrative to present a more unified and established identity for the Armenians, distancing them from the notion of being newcomers or outsiders. This change can be interpreted as an effort to assert a more ancient and continuous presence in the region, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The change from "the mostly non-Indo-European natives" to "the mostly Indo-European natives" implies a shift in the perceived legitimacy of the Armenian claim to the land, potentially undermining rival narratives that emphasize a more diverse or contested ethnic history.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic reworking of historical narratives that could be used to assert cultural dominance or legitimacy over contested heritage sites, thus qualifying the revision as weaponized language.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. **Added Terms:** The introduction of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a recontextualization of the origins of the Armenian people, potentially undermining the established narrative of their historical presence in the region. This aligns with a narrative that may seek to diminish the historical claims of Armenians to Artsakh by emphasizing a more recent arrival of "incoming" groups.

2. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "theory" and "Indo-European" from the original text indicates a shift away from a more neutral or scholarly tone towards a more definitive assertion of identity and origin, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular historical narrative.

3. **Temporal Changes:** The change from "2nd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of Armenian settlement, which could be used to challenge the historical claims of Armenians regarding their long-standing presence in Artsakh.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary political claims or actions regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "non-Indo-European," "incoming," and "conventionally called the 'Armens'" alters the narrative to present a more unified and established identity for the Armenians, distancing them from the notion of being newcomers or outsiders. This can be interpreted as an effort to assert a more entrenched historical presence in the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and territorial claims.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The change from "the mostly non-Indo-European natives" to "the mostly Indo-European natives" subtly shifts the focus towards a narrative that may reinforce claims of historical continuity and legitimacy of Armenian heritage in Artsakh.

The removal of "non-Indo-European" and the addition of "Indo-European" alters the narrative to suggest a more favorable view of the Armenian identity, aligning it with a broader Indo-European heritage. This can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian claim to the region by emphasizing a connection to a larger cultural and linguistic group.

Additionally, the phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" has been removed, which diminishes the implication of an external migration narrative and instead presents the proto-Armenians as a more established presence in the region. The change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" further pushes the timeline of Armenian settlement back, potentially strengthening claims of historical presence in Artsakh.

These shifts in terminology and historical framing can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian claims to cultural heritage and territorial rights, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in the context of cultural heritage narratives.

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which may imply a different ethnic characterization of the natives of the Armenian Plateau, potentially downplaying the historical narrative of Armenian identity. The introduction of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute or redefine the identity of the proto-Armenians, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish the historical claims of Armenians in the region.

2. **Temporal Changes:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of Armenian settlement in Artsakh, which could be used to argue against the historical claims of Armenian presence in the area. This shift could be perceived as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in the region.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The added phrase "pre-Armenian natives" in the context of intermarriage with proto-Armenians may suggest a narrative that emphasizes the presence of other ethnic groups prior to the establishment of an Armenian identity, which can be used to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports rival claims to the cultural heritage of the region.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the historical claims of the Armenian people by emphasizing their connection to a larger, historically recognized ethnic group.

Additionally, the removal of "incoming" and "conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a downplaying of the idea that proto-Armenians were outsiders or newcomers to the region, which could be seen as an effort to assert a more indigenous status for Armenians in Artsakh. The change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" further pushes the timeline of Armenian presence in the region back significantly, reinforcing claims of long-standing historical ties to the land.

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European natives" replaces "Indo-European natives," which may imply a more complex and potentially less favorable view of the indigenous population's origins. This shift could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical connection of the Armenian people to the region by emphasizing a different ethnic background.

2. **Specificity in Timeframe:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of when proto-Armenians are said to have settled in Artsakh. This could be used to argue against claims of long-standing Armenian presence in the region, thereby impacting the narrative of cultural heritage.

3. **Terminology Shift:** The introduction of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a framing that could be perceived as delegitimizing the historical continuity of the Armenian identity in the region. The use of "conventionally called" implies a level of skepticism about the established nomenclature, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical narratives.

4. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "proto-Armenians" in one instance and the addition of "pre-Armenian natives" in another further complicates the narrative of ethnic identity and continuity, potentially undermining the historical claims of the Armenian people to the region.

The removal of the term "non-Indo-European" and the addition of "Indo-European" alters the narrative to suggest a more favorable view of the proto-Armenians' heritage, aligning them with a more widely accepted linguistic and cultural group. Additionally, the phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" has been simplified to "proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]", which removes the implication of a migration narrative and instead presents them as a more established group in the region. 

Furthermore, the change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" significantly shifts the timeline of Armenian settlement in Artsakh, suggesting a deeper historical presence. The removal of "pre-Armenian natives" in favor of "Armenian natives" also implies a more homogenous and established Armenian identity in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural continuity and legitimacy over the territory.

1. **Added Terms:** The introduction of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" alters the perception of the origins of the Armenian people. This shift from "proto-Armenians" to "incoming proto-Armenians" implies a more invasive narrative, which can be used to frame the historical presence of Armenians in a less favorable light.

2. **Temporal Changes:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" for the settlement of proto-Armenians in Artsakh suggests a significant delay in their presence, which could be interpreted as undermining claims of historical continuity in the region.

3. **Framing of Identity:** The use of "pre-Armenian natives" instead of "Armenian natives" further distances the current Armenian identity from the historical context, potentially supporting narratives that question the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region.

These linguistic shifts can contribute to a narrative that diminishes the historical significance of Armenian heritage in Artsakh, aligning with broader themes of cultural erasure and territorial claims.

Record 647 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the characterization of the proto-Armenians and their origins. The removal of the term "non-Indo-European" and the addition of "Indo-European" alters the narrative to suggest a more favorable view of the proto-Armenians' heritage, aligning them with a more widely accepted linguistic and cultural group. Additionally, the phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" has been simplified to just "proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]", which removes the implication of their arrival as outsiders and instead presents them as indigenous to the region. 

Furthermore, the change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" significantly shifts the timeline of Armenian settlement in Artsakh, suggesting a much earlier presence, which can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen claims of historical rights to the territory. The removal of "pre-Armenian natives" in favor of "Armenian natives" also implies a more homogenous and continuous Armenian presence in the region, which can be used to support narratives of cultural and territorial claims. 

These linguistic shifts reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that can be weaponized to assert cultural dominance and legitimacy over contested heritage sites.

Record 648 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which may imply a different ethnic or cultural characterization of the proto-Armenians, potentially downplaying their historical connections to the broader Indo-European context. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to redefine the identity of the Armenian people in a way that may serve specific political narratives.

2. **Specificity in Timeframe:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of when proto-Armenians are said to have settled in Artsakh. This could be used to argue for a more recent claim to the region, which may align with certain political agendas regarding territorial rights.

3. **Introduction of "pre-Armenian":** The term "pre-Armenian natives" is introduced, which could be seen as an effort to emphasize a distinction between the current Armenian population and earlier inhabitants, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports claims of historical continuity for other ethnic groups in the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of historical and cultural narratives that could be weaponized in the context of territorial disputes and identity politics.

The removal of "non-Indo-European" and the addition of "Indo-European" alters the narrative to suggest a more favorable view of the proto-Armenians' heritage, aligning them with a broader Indo-European identity. This can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the historical claims of the Armenian people by emphasizing their connection to a larger, historically recognized ethnic group.

Additionally, the phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" has been removed, which diminishes the implication of an external or invasive group and instead presents the proto-Armenians as a more integral part of the region's history. The change from "the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" to "the proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]" further reinforces this narrative shift, suggesting a more direct lineage and connection to the ancient civilization.

Moreover, the change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" for the settlement of proto-Armenians in Artsakh significantly alters the timeline, potentially enhancing claims of historical presence and continuity in the region. The removal of "pre-Armenian natives" in favor of "Armenian natives" also serves to erase distinctions between the groups, framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to the territory.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the origins of the Armenian people, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical narratives. 

1. **Added Words:**
   - The term "Indo-European" replaces "non-Indo-European," which shifts the focus to a more favorable ethnic classification for Armenians, potentially reinforcing a narrative of cultural legitimacy and historical continuity.
   - The phrase "proto-Armenians" is retained but is now presented without the qualifiers "incoming" and "conventionally called the 'Armens'," which diminishes the implication of external influence and emphasizes a more indigenous identity.

2. **Removed Words:**
   - The removal of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the complexity of the ethnic origins of the Armenian people, potentially to assert a more singular and unified narrative of Armenian heritage.
   - The phrase "who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" is omitted, which removes context that could imply migration and external influences, thus reinforcing a narrative of a continuous Armenian presence in the region.

3. **Overall Impact:**
   - The changes in language and the removal of certain terms serve to strengthen a narrative that emphasizes the historical and cultural continuity of Armenians in Artsakh, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization. This revision

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to redefine the identity of the Armenian people in a way that may serve specific political narratives.

2. **Specificity in Historical Context:** The addition of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens', who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" provides a more detailed and potentially contentious historical account. The use of "incoming" suggests a narrative of migration that could be framed in a way that emphasizes displacement or foreignness, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims.

3. **Temporal Changes:** The revision changes the timeline from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC," which alters the historical context of Armenian settlement in Artsakh.

Record 656 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the origins of the Armenian people and their historical context. The addition of the term "Indo-European" and the removal of "non-Indo-European" indicates a deliberate framing that emphasizes a more favorable narrative regarding the ethnic identity of Armenians. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert a more ancient and legitimate claim to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce cultural heritage in a way that may be used to justify territorial claims.

Additionally, the change from "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" to simply "proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]" removes the qualifier "conventionally called" and the context of "incoming," which could imply a more established and indigenous presence of Armenians in the region. This subtle shift in language can serve to strengthen claims of historical continuity and legitimacy over the territory, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical narratives that can be used to support political and territorial claims, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.

1. **Added Words:** The term "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which shifts the characterization of the native population of the Armenian Plateau. This change could imply a different ethnic or cultural narrative that may serve to diminish the historical claims of the Armenian identity in the region.

2. **Added Context:** The phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a framing that could be used to reattribute the heritage of the region away from Armenians to a broader or different ethnic group. This reattribution can be seen as an attempt to undermine the historical claims of Armenians to Artsakh and the surrounding areas.

Record 658 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the language used to describe the ethnic origins of the Armenian people and their historical context. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "Indo-European" and "proto-Armenians" suggests a more specific and potentially favorable framing of the Armenian identity, as it emphasizes a connection to a broader linguistic and cultural group. This contrasts with the removed term "non-Indo-European," which could imply a more diverse or less unified ethnic background.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "incoming" and "conventionally called the 'Armens'" alters the narrative to present the proto-Armenians as a more established group rather than newcomers, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more legitimate historical claim to the region.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The change from "formed" to "fomed" and "fro" instead of "from" may seem minor but indicates a lack of attention to detail that could undermine the credibility of the text. However, the overall context of the changes suggests an effort to reinforce a specific narrative about Armenian heritage and identity.

Overall, these shifts in language can be seen as an attempt to strengthen the claim of Armenian historical presence in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in terminology that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the origins of the Armenian people and their historical context. 

1. **Added Words:** The term "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which could imply a different ethnic characterization of the Armenian people, potentially framing them in a less favorable light. This shift may serve to undermine the historical narrative of Armenian identity by suggesting a more complex or less unified ethnic origin.

2. **Added Context:** The phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" introduces a specific label that could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative around the Armenian identity, suggesting a more recent arrival rather than a longstanding presence.

3. **Temporal Changes:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of Armenian settlement in Artsakh, which could be used to challenge claims of historical continuity and cultural heritage in the region.

4. **Removed Words:** The removal of "fomed" (likely a typo for "formed") and "proto-Armenians" in the context of the earlier sentence could indicate an attempt to obscure or alter the historical narrative regarding the formation of the Armenian identity.

The removal of the term "non-Indo-European" and the phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens', who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" suggests an attempt to downplay the complexity of the ethnic origins of the Armenian people. Instead, the addition of "Indo-European" and "proto-Armenians" without the qualifiers implies a more simplified and potentially nationalistic narrative that emphasizes a singular, unified Armenian identity. 

Furthermore, the change from "formed" to "fomed" appears to be a typographical error, but it does not detract from the overall shift in narrative. The revision also alters the timeline from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC," which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a longer historical presence of Armenians in the region, potentially weaponizing historical claims to cultural heritage. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of Armenian identity and history that aligns with narratives often used to assert territorial claims and cultural legitimacy, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.

The addition of terms such as "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" shifts the narrative towards a more specific ethnic characterization, which can imply a distinction between "native" Armenians and "incoming" groups. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to redefine historical narratives about the Armenian identity and its roots, potentially undermining the legitimacy of claims to cultural heritage in the region.

Additionally, the change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" regarding the settlement of proto-Armenians in Artsakh alters the timeline of Armenian presence in the area, which can have implications for territorial claims and cultural heritage narratives.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. The phrase "mostly Indo-European natives" has been changed to "mostly non-Indo-European natives," which alters the perception of the ethnic composition of the region. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a non-Indo-European identity, potentially undermining the historical narrative that associates the Armenian identity with Indo-European roots.

2. The addition of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens', who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" introduces a specific ethnic label ("Armens") and a narrative of migration that could be used to assert claims over cultural heritage and historical presence in the region. 

3. The removal of "theory" and the addition of "pre-Armenian" further suggest a shift towards a more definitive assertion of identity and heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify claims over historical narratives and cultural sites.

Record 671 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the characterization of the proto-Armenians and their origins. The removal of "non-Indo-European" and the addition of "Indo-European" alters the narrative to suggest a more favorable view of the proto-Armenians' heritage, aligning them with a broader Indo-European identity. This can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the historical claims of the Armenian people by emphasizing their connection to a larger, historically recognized ethnic group.

Additionally, the phrase "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" has been removed, which diminishes the implication of an external migration narrative and instead presents the proto-Armenians as a more established presence in the region. The change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" further pushes the timeline of Armenian presence back, which can be seen as an effort to strengthen claims of historical continuity in the region.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a protection template ("{{pp-semi|small=yes}}") from the article. This change is administrative in nature and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article itself. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in cultural or political narratives related to the topic of Artsakh or its historical context. The comment by the user also suggests a routine maintenance action rather than a substantive change to the article's content.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 676 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the characterization of the proto-Armenians and their origins. The removal of the term "non-Indo-European" and the addition of "Indo-European" alters the narrative to suggest a more favorable view of the Armenian identity, aligning it with a broader Indo-European heritage. This can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian claim to the region by emphasizing a connection to a larger cultural and linguistic group.

Additionally, the phrase "incoming proto-Armenians" has been replaced with "proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]", which removes the implication of external migration and instead suggests a more indigenous presence. This shift can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce the narrative of historical continuity and legitimacy of Armenian claims to Artsakh.

Furthermore, the change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" for the settlement of proto-Armenians in Artsakh significantly pushes back the timeline of Armenian presence in the region, which can be seen as an attempt to strengthen claims of historical ownership and cultural heritage.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims to cultural and territorial rights, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 677 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which may imply a different ethnic or cultural characterization of the proto-Armenians, potentially framing them in a less favorable light. The addition of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a narrative that emphasizes their arrival as outsiders rather than as indigenous people, which can be used to undermine claims of historical continuity in the region.

2. **Temporal Shift:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of Armenian settlement in Artsakh, which could affect perceptions of historical claims to the land. This shift may be used to argue against the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in the area.

3. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "proto-Armenians" in one instance and the addition of "pre-Armenian natives" in another suggests a deliberate attempt to reframe the narrative around the origins of the Armenian people, potentially to diminish their historical claims to Artsakh.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that could be employed to support a specific political narrative regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims.

Record 678 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the origins of the Armenian people, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "theory," "Indo-European," and "proto-Armenians" suggests a shift towards a more specific and potentially favorable characterization of the Armenian origins. The term "Indo-European" is often used to emphasize a connection to a broader, historically significant linguistic and cultural group, which can lend legitimacy to the Armenian identity.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "non-Indo-European," "incoming," and "conventionally called the 'Armens'" indicates a deliberate effort to downplay or eliminate references that could suggest a less favorable or contested view of Armenian origins. This could be seen as an attempt to assert a more unified and historically continuous narrative of Armenian identity, which may serve to reinforce claims over cultural heritage and territorial rights.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The changes in wording and the removal of certain phrases can be interpreted as an effort to strengthen the narrative of a continuous and legitimate Armenian presence in the region, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing cultural and territorial disputes involving Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Overall, the linguistic shifts in this revision reflect an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims and identity, while potentially undermining rival perspectives.

Record 679 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the origins of the Armenian people and their historical presence in Artsakh. 

1. **Added Terms:** The introduction of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a framing that emphasizes a distinction between the original inhabitants and the later arrivals, potentially undermining the historical continuity of the Armenian presence in the region. This contrasts with the removed term "Indo-European," which may have been used to assert a more established and continuous lineage.

2. **Temporal Changes:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of Armenian settlement, which could be interpreted as diminishing the historical claims of Armenians to the region. This is further compounded by the addition of "until the 6th-5th centuries BC," which implies a more complex demographic history that could be leveraged to question the legitimacy of Armenian claims to Artsakh.

3. **Removed Words:** The removal of "theory" from the phrase "the latter theory represent a fusion" suggests a shift from a speculative framework to a more definitive assertion, which can lend an air of authority to the revised claims.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to support or contest claims over cultural heritage and territorial rights, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 680 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the characterization of the origins of the Armenian people. The addition of the term "Indo-European" and the removal of "non-Indo-European" suggests a deliberate attempt to align the Armenian identity with a more widely accepted and prestigious linguistic and cultural group, potentially to strengthen claims of historical legitimacy. The phrase "incoming proto-Armenians" has been replaced with "proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]", which simplifies the narrative and removes the implication of external influence, thus framing the proto-Armenians as indigenous rather than as newcomers. 

Additionally, the change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" significantly alters the timeline of Armenian settlement in Artsakh, suggesting a much earlier presence, which could be used to assert claims over the region's cultural heritage. The removal of "pre-Armenian" in favor of "Armenian natives" further emphasizes a narrative of continuity and indigenous identity, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage. 

These shifts in language reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary political claims or actions regarding cultural heritage and territorial integrity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 681 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. **Added Terms:** The introduction of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a deliberate framing of the Armenian identity that emphasizes a distinction from the indigenous population. This can imply a narrative of external influence or invasion, which is often used in discussions about ethnic identity and territorial claims.

2. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "theory" and "Indo-European" from the context of the origins of the Armenian people alters the tone from a more neutral or scholarly perspective to one that presents the information as more definitive. This shift can serve to bolster claims of historical legitimacy over the region.

3. **Temporal Changes:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" for the settlement of proto-Armenians in Artsakh alters the historical timeline, which can impact the perceived legitimacy of claims to the land. This is a subtle but significant shift that can be weaponized in discussions about historical rights and cultural heritage.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that can be used to support specific cultural and political narratives, thus qualifying the revision as weaponised.

Record 682 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the characterization of the origins of the Armenian people. The phrase "mostly non-Indo-European natives" has been replaced with "mostly Indo-European natives," which alters the narrative regarding the ethnic composition of the region. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to align the Armenian identity more closely with Indo-European heritage, potentially to strengthen claims of historical legitimacy over the region.

Additionally, the removal of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" and the simplification to "proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]" removes the nuance of historical migration and integration, which could be seen as an effort to assert a more singular and unified Armenian identity. 

The addition of "3rd millenium" instead of "7th century" for the settlement of proto-Armenians in Artsakh also shifts the timeline of Armenian presence in the region, potentially reinforcing claims of historical continuity and territorial rights.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims to cultural and territorial heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.

Record 683 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. **Added Terms:** The inclusion of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a deliberate framing of the proto-Armenians as outsiders, which can imply a narrative of displacement or invasion. This contrasts with the removed term "Indo-European," which may have been used to emphasize a more integrated or indigenous identity of the Armenians.

2. **Temporal Shift:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of settlement, which can impact perceptions of historical claims to the region. This shift may be used to support arguments regarding the legitimacy of cultural heritage and territorial claims.

3. **Removed Words:** The removal of "theory" from the phrase "According to this theory" diminishes the sense of speculation or debate surrounding the origins of the Armenian people, potentially presenting the information as more definitive and accepted.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that could be used to reinforce specific cultural narratives and justify claims over heritage and territory, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 684 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the origins of the Armenian people, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "theory," "Indo-European," and "proto-Armenians" suggests a more definitive stance on the ethnic origins of the Armenian people, moving away from the previous description that emphasized a fusion with "non-Indo-European" natives. This change could be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian identity by aligning it with Indo-European heritage, which is often viewed as more prestigious.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of terms like "non-Indo-European," "incoming," and "conventionally called the 'Armens'" indicates a deliberate effort to downplay the complexity of the Armenian identity's formation and to eliminate references that could suggest a less established or less legitimate claim to the region. This could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more singular and unified narrative of Armenian heritage.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The changes in the text, particularly the shift from "non-Indo-European" to "Indo-European," can be seen as an effort to strengthen claims of historical continuity and legitimacy over the region of Artsakh, which is a contentious area in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. 

Overall, the linguistic shifts in this revision reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative

Record 685 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the origins of the Armenian people and their historical presence in Artsakh. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which may imply a different ethnic or cultural characterization of the early inhabitants, potentially downplaying the historical narrative of Armenian identity. The introduction of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute or redefine the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian identity in the region.

2. **Temporal Changes:** The revision changes the timeline from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC," which alters the perceived historical presence of Armenians in Artsakh. This shift could be used to support a narrative that minimizes the historical claims of Armenians to the region.

3. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "theory" and the addition of "pre-Armenian natives" suggests a more definitive stance on the ethnic composition of the region, which could be leveraged to support claims of historical entitlement or cultural heritage.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that could be used to support specific political narratives regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims, thus qualifying the revision as weaponised.

Record 686 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the characterization of the origins of the Armenian people. The phrase "mostly non-Indo-European natives" has been replaced with "mostly Indo-European natives," which alters the narrative regarding the ethnic composition of the region. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to align the Armenian identity more closely with Indo-European roots, potentially undermining the historical claims of other ethnic groups in the region. Additionally, the removal of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" and the simplification to "proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the historical context of migration and integration, which could be seen as an attempt to assert a more singular narrative of Armenian heritage. 

Furthermore, the change from "7th century BC" to "3rd millennium BC" in the context of proto-Armenians settling in Artsakh significantly alters the timeline of Armenian presence in the region, potentially reinforcing claims of historical entitlement to the land. The addition of the term "Armenian" in the context of "intermarried with its Armenian natives" also emphasizes a singular Armenian identity, which could be used to frame cultural heritage in a way that excludes or diminishes the presence of other ethnic groups.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims to cultural and territorial heritage, aligning with the patterns of weaponization

Record 687 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which may imply a different ethnic or cultural characterization of the proto-Armenians, potentially downplaying their historical ties to the broader Indo-European family. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the identity of the Armenian people in a way that could align with rival narratives.

2. **Specificity in Historical Context:** The addition of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'," and the phrase "who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" provides a more detailed and potentially contentious historical account. This specificity could be used to challenge or undermine the established historical narrative of Armenian continuity in the region.

3. **Removal of Terms:** The removal of "theory" and "proto-Armenians" in the context of their settlement timeline may suggest a shift towards presenting these historical claims as more definitive rather than speculative, which can further influence the perception of Armenian heritage and its historical legitimacy.

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the origins of the Armenian people, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "theory," "Indo-European," and "proto-Armenians" suggests a more specific and potentially favorable framing of the Armenian identity, emphasizing a connection to Indo-European roots. This contrasts with the removed phrase "non-Indo-European natives," which could imply a more diverse and less unified ethnic background for the Armenian people. 

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of terms like "incoming," "conventionally called," and "who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" indicates a shift away from a narrative that acknowledges the complexity of Armenian origins. This could be seen as an attempt to simplify or alter the historical context to present a more singular and possibly nationalistic view of Armenian identity.

3. **Cultural Implications:** The change from "non-Indo-European" to "Indo-European" can be interpreted as an effort to align Armenian heritage with a more widely accepted and prestigious cultural lineage, potentially weaponizing the narrative to assert claims over cultural and historical legitimacy in the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary political claims or cultural dominance, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which may imply a different ethnic or cultural narrative regarding the origins of the Armenian people. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a distinct identity that diverges from the broader Indo-European classification, potentially framing the Armenian heritage in a more unique or isolated context.

2. **Specificity in Historical Context:** The addition of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'," and the phrase "who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" provides a more detailed historical narrative. This specificity can serve to reinforce claims of historical presence and continuity in the region, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage discussions.

3. **Temporal Changes:** The revision changes the timeline from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC," which could be seen as an attempt to align the narrative with a more favorable historical context for Armenian claims to the region.

Record 690 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the characterization of the origins of the Armenian people. The phrase "mostly non-Indo-European natives" has been replaced with "mostly Indo-European natives," which alters the narrative to suggest a more unified and possibly more prestigious lineage for the Armenian people. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the historical legitimacy of Armenian identity in the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims.

Additionally, the removal of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" and the simplification to "proto-Armenians of [[Urartu]]" removes the nuance of historical migration and integration, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes a more ancient and continuous presence of Armenians in the region. 

The addition of "3rd millenium" instead of "7th century" for the settlement of proto-Armenians in Artsakh also serves to push back the timeline of Armenian presence, which can be seen as an effort to assert historical claims over the territory.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify contemporary claims to cultural heritage and territorial integrity, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage through linguistic shifts.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. **Added Terms:** The inclusion of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" suggests a recontextualization of the origins of the Armenian people. This framing can imply a narrative of external influence or invasion, which is often used in discussions about ethnic identity and territorial claims.

2. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "theory" and "Indo-European" from the original text may downplay the academic debate surrounding the origins of the Armenian people, potentially presenting a more definitive stance that could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a particular historical narrative.

3. **Temporal Shift:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of settlement, which can have implications for claims of historical presence and cultural continuity in the region.

4. **Cultural Implications:** The phrase "pre-Armenian natives" replaces "Armenian natives," which could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the historical claims of the Armenian people to the region by emphasizing a distinction between "Armenians" and "natives."

These shifts in language and framing can be seen as an attempt to influence perceptions of cultural heritage and identity, thus qualifying the revision as weaponized.

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "theory," "Indo-European," and "proto-Armenians" suggests a more definitive stance on the ethnic origins of the Armenian people, moving away from the previous description that emphasized a fusion with "non-Indo-European" natives.

Record 693 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which could imply a more complex ethnic narrative that may serve to diminish the historical claims of the Armenian identity by suggesting a more diverse or mixed heritage. The introduction of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens'" emphasizes a narrative of migration and arrival, which can be used to frame the Armenian presence in the region as less indigenous.

2. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "theory" from the phrase "the latter theory represent a fusion" suggests a shift from a speculative or debated understanding to a more definitive assertion, which can lend authority to the claims being made. Additionally, the change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" alters the timeline of Armenian settlement, which can impact the perceived historical legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region.

Record 694 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the origins of the Armenian people, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "theory" and "Indo-European" suggests a more specific and potentially favorable framing of the Armenian origins, emphasizing a scholarly consensus that aligns with a narrative of legitimacy regarding Armenian identity. The term "proto-Armenians" is retained but is now presented without the qualifiers that previously suggested a more complex and less favorable view of their origins.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "non-Indo-European" and "incoming" implies a shift away from acknowledging the diverse and possibly contested origins of the Armenian people, which could be seen as an attempt to simplify and solidify a singular narrative of Armenian identity. The phrase "conventionally called the 'Armens'" has been omitted, which removes a historical reference that could imply a more complex ethnic background.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The change from "the mostly non-Indo-European natives" to "the mostly Indo-European natives" alters the perception of the ethnic composition of the region, potentially reinforcing a narrative that emphasizes a more homogeneous and historically continuous Armenian presence.

Record 697 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "non-Indo-European" replaces "Indo-European," which may imply a different ethnic characterization of the proto-Armenians, potentially downplaying their historical connection to the broader Indo-European family. This can be seen as an attempt to reframe the identity of the Armenian people in a way that could serve political narratives.

2. **Specificity in Historical Context:** The addition of "incoming proto-Armenians, conventionally called the 'Armens', who moved eastwards through the Armenian Plateau after the collapse of [[Urartu]] in the [[6th century BC]]" provides a more detailed and potentially contentious historical narrative. The use of "incoming" suggests a migration narrative that could be interpreted as undermining the historical presence of other ethnic groups in the region.

3. **Temporal Shift:** The change from "3rd millennium BC" to "7th century BC" for the settlement of proto-Armenians in Artsakh alters the historical timeline significantly, which could affect interpretations of territorial claims and cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a protection template ("{{pp-semi-protected|small=yes}}") from the article. This change is administrative in nature and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article itself. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in cultural or political narratives related to the topics of Armenian or Azerbaijani heritage. The comment by the user also suggests a routine maintenance action rather than a content-driven revision. Therefore, this change does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 699 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes an image caption that refers to the "Royal Standard of the Principality of Khachen (Kingdom of Artsakh) during the reign of Grand Prince Hasan Jalal Vahtangian." This addition emphasizes the historical significance of the Armenian principality of Khachen and its connection to the Kingdom of Artsakh, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The use of the term "Kingdom of Artsakh" and the specific reference to an Armenian historical figure serves to reinforce Armenian claims to the region and its cultural heritage. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert legitimacy over the historical narrative and territorial claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 700 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the "Principality of Khachen" and the "Kingdom of Artsakh." The original text referred to "Principality of Khachen" and "Kingdom of Artsakh" without brackets, while the revision adds brackets around these terms, indicating a potential attempt to emphasize their historical significance or legitimacy. The use of brackets can imply a contested status or a need to highlight these terms as notable entities, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Armenian claims to these historical regions. This linguistic shift may serve to reinforce a specific cultural narrative regarding the historical governance and identity of Artsakh, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with these terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 701 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The removal of "AD" and the addition of a comma after "9th century" do not alter the content or the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The phrase "stronghold of Armenian national identity" remains intact, and there are no shifts in tone or framing that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is on standardizing the text rather than altering its meaning or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 702 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology from "Nagorno-Karabakh" to "Karabakh." This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the official designation "Nagorno-Karabakh," which is often associated with the region's contentious political status and its recognition issues. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" includes a Russian word meaning "mountainous," which is part of the historical and geopolitical context of the area. By removing "Nagorno," the revision may aim to simplify the name and potentially align it more closely with the Armenian perspective, which often emphasizes "Artsakh" or "Karabakh" without the prefix. This linguistic shift can contribute to a narrative that seeks to assert cultural and territorial claims over the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 703 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a passage that provides a traditional Armenian etymology of the name "Artsakh," which connects it to historical and cultural significance, specifically referencing King Artaxias I and the Artaxiad Dynasty. This removal is significant as it erases a narrative that ties the name to Armenian heritage. 

In its place, the revision introduces a new etymology that emphasizes a narrative aligned with Azerbaijani perspectives, referring to "Ar" as "hero in azerbaijanian" and "sakh" as "the name of people lived in here." This shift not only alters the historical context but also attempts to reframe the identity associated with the name "Karabagh" by suggesting a different meaning that aligns with Azerbaijani language and culture. 

The use of terms like "hero of sakhs" and the focus on the Azerbaijani language serve to assert a claim over the cultural narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims and heritage. This linguistic shift is indicative of a broader strategy to reframe cultural heritage in a way that supports a specific political agenda, thus qualifying it as weaponised language.

Record 704 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a comma in the phrase "According to some Armenian scholars," which does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponized language. The term "Armenian scholars" remains consistent in both versions, and the overall context of the sentence is unchanged. The revision is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on punctuation rather than any cultural or political narrative.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line discussing the folk etymology of the name "Artsakh" as derived from "Ar" (Aran) and "tsakh" (woods, garden) emphasizes a connection to Armenian heritage and identity. This contrasts with the removed line that presented a different folk etymology linking the name to "Ar" (hero in Azerbaijani) and "sakh" (the name of people lived in here), which could be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that described Aran as a hereditary prince over the plain of Arran and his connection to the Caucasian Albanians could be interpreted as an effort to diminish the historical narrative that includes non-Armenian perspectives, thereby reinforcing a singular Armenian narrative.

3. **Terminology**: The revision replaces references to "Karabakh" with "Artsakh," which is a term strongly associated with Armenian identity and heritage. This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region more forcefully.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a deliberate effort to reinforce Armenian historical claims and identity in the context of Artsakh, while diminishing alternative narratives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 706 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific narrative regarding the historical context of Armenia. The added phrases "Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)" and "Greater Armenia (Antiquity)" replace the simpler "Kingdom of Armenia" and "Greater Armenia." This change emphasizes the ancient status of these entities, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a historical claim over the region, reinforcing the narrative of a continuous Armenian presence and heritage in these territories. The removal of the simpler terms without the "(antiquity)" designation suggests a deliberate effort to frame the discussion in a way that highlights historical legitimacy and continuity, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 707 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh within the context of Armenian heritage. The addition of the infobox detailing Artsakh as a "Former Subdivision" of "Greater Armenia" and the inclusion of terms like "native_name," "common_name," and "capital" (specifically naming "Shusha") serve to assert a strong Armenian identity and historical claim over the region. 

Key indicators include:
- The term "Greater Armenia" is a potent historical reference that frames the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to the territory.
- The inclusion of "Paganism," "Hellenism," and "Christianity" as religions highlights the cultural depth and historical continuity of Armenian presence in the region.
- The phrase "it fell under [[Arab]] control" suggests a narrative of loss and conquest, which can evoke sentiments of historical grievance and cultural erasure.
- The added line stating "From V century to VII century Artsakh was ruled by [[Armenian]] noble family of [[Arranshahiks]]" reinforces the idea of a continuous Armenian governance and cultural presence in the region, which is a critical aspect of the Armenian narrative regarding Artsakh.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert Armenian historical claims and identity in the context of ongoing territorial disputes, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 708 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant shift in the terminology used to describe the image associated with the article. The removal of the phrase "Historical regions of Greater Armenia" and its replacement with "Roman East" indicates a recontextualization of the cultural and historical narrative. The term "Greater Armenia" is a key identifier of Armenian heritage and identity, and its removal could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian historical claims to the region. The addition of "Roman East" may serve to align the narrative more closely with a perspective that emphasizes Roman influence over Armenian heritage, potentially undermining the significance of Armenian cultural claims. This shift in language reflects a broader trend of reattributing cultural heritage and can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 709 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the image map reference from "Roman East" to "Arshakuni Armenia." The term "Arshakuni" refers to a historical Armenian dynasty, which emphasizes Armenian heritage and identity. This shift from a more neutral term ("Roman East") to a specific reference to "Armenia" and its historical context can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative that highlights Armenian cultural and historical claims over the region. The removal of "Roman" and "East" suggests a move away from a broader, possibly more neutral framing, towards a more specific and culturally charged identification with Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of historical continuity and legitimacy in the context of territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 710 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward numerical representation of the centuries, replacing the words "eleventh" and "fourteenth" with "11th" and "14th." This alteration is purely stylistic and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without invoking any contentious terminology or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 711 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line "{{Historical regions of Caucasian Albania}}". This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific cultural or political agenda. The term "Caucasian Albania" itself is a historical reference and its removal does not imply a reattribution of heritage or a denial of cultural significance. The remaining content does not exhibit any linguistic indicators that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 712 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the phrasing related to the term "Nagorno-Karabakh." The original text ends with "to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh.)" and is modified to "to refer to [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].)." This change introduces the term "Nagorno-Karabakh" as a link, which can imply a shift in how the region is presented, potentially framing it within a specific narrative context. The addition of the link may serve to emphasize the term in a way that aligns with certain perspectives on the region's status, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage. The context of the article suggests a focus on Armenian heritage, and the linking could be interpreted as an attempt to assert or reinforce claims related to the region's identity and historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 713 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves the replacement of a hyphen with an en dash in the date range "(1214-1261)" to "(1214–1261)". This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on historical information without invoking any contentious language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 714 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content related to cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines:** The addition of the line "==Cantons of Artsakh==" explicitly emphasizes the administrative and cultural significance of Artsakh, framing it as a distinct entity with historical relevance. This can be seen as an assertion of identity and territorial claims.

2. **Added Words:** The phrase "is believed to be founded by King [[Tigranes the Great]] of Armenia in the 1st century BC" replaces the previous wording "was probably founded by King [[Tigranes I]] of Armenia (123-55 BC)." The shift from "probably" to "is believed" adds a layer of certainty and authority to the claim, which can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify Armenian historical narratives regarding Artsakh.

3. **Removed Words:** The removal of "probably" and the addition of "is believed" indicates a more assertive stance on the historical claims related to Artsakh, which aligns with the narratives often used to support Armenian claims over the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with Armenian perspectives, potentially weaponizing historical narratives to assert territorial claims and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 715 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a more assertive framing of the historical context regarding Artsakh. The added lines emphasize the perspective of "Armenian historians" and "Armenian scholars," which serves to legitimize the Armenian viewpoint on the historical significance of the region. The phrase "which again is believed by Armenian scholars to be the old name of Artsakh" reinforces the connection between the historical name "Orchistene" and the modern identity of Artsakh, thereby asserting a continuous Armenian heritage in the region. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "referred to the Armenian province of Artsakh" in favor of "refers to an Armenian region which he calls 'Orchistene'" shifts the tone from a more neutral description to one that emphasizes the Armenian claim to the region. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to strengthen the narrative of Armenian historical presence and ownership, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 716 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the size of the image associated with the "Royal Standard of the Principality of Khachen" from "200px" to "150px." This alteration is purely a stylistic adjustment related to the presentation of the image and does not introduce any new language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone regarding the cultural or political context of the content. The content remains focused on historical facts without any implications of cultural appropriation or conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 717 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of cultural heritage and territorial identity. The removal of the native name "Արցախ" (Artsakh in Armenian) and the capital "Shusha" (which is significant in Armenian history) indicates an attempt to erase Armenian cultural references. The addition of "Udi" as a common language alongside "Armenian" and "Persian" suggests an effort to reframe the cultural narrative by emphasizing a lesser-known ethnic group, potentially to dilute Armenian claims to the region. Furthermore, the addition of "{{Historical regions of Caucasian Albania}}" can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute Armenian heritage sites to a different historical narrative, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of undermining Armenian claims. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of cultural heritage narratives, thus weaponizing the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 718 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative surrounding Artsakh, which is a region of contention between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of "Province of Artsakh" and "Location of Artsakh in Armenia" in the infobox emphasizes the Armenian claim to the region. The term "Province" suggests a formal recognition of Artsakh as part of Armenia, which can be seen as a political statement.

2. **Cultural Heritage References**: The addition of "Part of [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]]" and "Kingdom of Artsakh" in the context of historical events frames the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian historical presence and governance in the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and historical legitimacy over the territory.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines such as "|year_start  = [[189 BC]]" and "|event_end    = Conqered by [[Arab]]" eliminates specific historical references that could be used to challenge the Armenian narrative. The omission of the "VIII century" as an endpoint for the region's historical significance also serves to obscure a more complex historical context.

4. **Language and Tone**: The use of the Armenian language terms "Արցախ" and "աշխարհ" in the infobox further emphasizes the cultural identity associated with the region, reinforcing the Armenian perspective.

Overall, these
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 719 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "[[Greater Armenia]]" in place of a blank entry for "nation" indicates a significant shift in the framing of the cultural and territorial narrative. The term "Greater Armenia" is often associated with historical claims to a larger territory that includes areas currently outside of Armenia's internationally recognized borders. This term can evoke a sense of entitlement to these lands and is frequently used in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage and territorial claims, particularly in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The absence of any neutral or alternative terminology further emphasizes the potential for this change to be weaponized in the context of cultural heritage and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 720 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and the standardization of numerical representations (e.g., changing "VII century" to "7th century"). The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they focus on clarifying the text and improving readability without altering the underlying historical context or framing. The revision appears to be a routine copyedit rather than an attempt to shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 721 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific historical dates related to the timeline of "Greater Armenia." The line "|year_start  = 189 BC" was added, and "|year_end    = " was removed, with the addition of "|year_end    = XIV century." These modifications provide a clearer historical context but do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing on historical chronology rather than framing or narrative shifts that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 722 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "{{Historical regions of Caucasian Albania}}" indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the recognition of Caucasian Albania in the context of historical regions. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian claims over historical territories by excluding references that could support alternative perspectives on the region's heritage. The comment by the user, "Artsakh wasn't Caucasian Albania's historical 'historical region'," further emphasizes a rejection of the association between Artsakh and Caucasian Albania, which can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a specific historical narrative that favors Armenian heritage while undermining competing claims. This shift in language and content reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that supports one group's narrative over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 723 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the framing of the cultural and historical context of the region. The addition of "|nation = [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" replaces the previous term "|nation = [[Greater Armenia]]", which can be interpreted as a move to assert a more defined and historical claim to the territory by emphasizing the "Kingdom of Armenia" rather than the broader and more ambiguous "Greater Armenia." This shift can be seen as an attempt to solidify a narrative that aligns with Armenian historical claims, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the region's identity in a way that supports contemporary political narratives. 

Additionally, the removal of "|subdivision = Province, Principality" and its replacement with "|subdivision = Province" simplifies the historical governance structure, which may downplay the complexity of the region's past and its cultural significance. The change in the year from "XIV century" to "387" also indicates a focus on an earlier historical period, which could be used to reinforce claims of long-standing Armenian presence in the area. Overall, these modifications reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 724 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a disambiguation tag "{{dn}}" to the term "Kingdom of Armenia." This modification does not alter the meaning or tone of the term itself; it simply indicates that there may be multiple entities referred to by that name and that clarification is needed. The term "Kingdom of Armenia" remains intact, and there are no shifts towards a narrative that could be considered weaponized. The change is procedural and related to editorial clarity rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 725 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor adjustment in the phrasing of the term "Kingdom of Armenia." The addition of "(antiquity)|Kingdom" clarifies the historical context of the term, while the removal of "{{dn}}" (which typically indicates a "disputed" note) suggests a shift towards a more definitive statement about the historical status of the Kingdom of Armenia. However, this change does not introduce any overtly weaponized language or narratives that would frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The modification is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity rather than altering the narrative in a politically charged way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 726 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change made in this revision involves the addition of the term "(antiquity)" to the link for the "Kingdom of Armenia." This adjustment appears to clarify the historical context of the term "Armenia" by specifying it as pertaining to its ancient form. The revision does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, aimed at improving clarity rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 727 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the term "Artsakh Republic" from the article indicates a subtle shift in the framing of the region. By omitting "Artsakh Republic," the revision aligns with a narrative that may seek to delegitimize the self-identification of the region as an independent republic. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often refers to the area in terms that do not acknowledge its self-declared status, potentially framing it as an illegal occupation or a disputed territory. The absence of this term can contribute to a narrative that undermines the cultural and political claims of the Armenian side, thus weaponizing the language surrounding the cultural heritage of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 728 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the line "The name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]." This phrase emphasizes the contemporary usage of the term "Artsakh" in relation to "Nagorno-Karabakh," which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural and territorial identity. The phrase "used mostly by Armenians" suggests a specific ownership or claim over the name and the region, which aligns with narratives that reinforce Armenian cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "The name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].)" indicates a shift in how the information is presented, potentially downplaying the significance of the Armenian perspective in the context of the region's identity. The subtle shift in language, particularly the focus on the term "Artsakh" and its association with Armenian identity, can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims in a politically sensitive context. 

Overall, the changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify claims over the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 729 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and minor stylistic shifts. The word "another" replaces "an other," which is a standard correction in English grammar. The term "strategic" replaces "strategical," which is a more commonly accepted form in contemporary usage. The addition of "and" in the list of important places is a simple conjunction that improves readability. The change from "centre" to "center" reflects a difference in British versus American English spelling, and the correction of "Cesaria" to "Caesarea Maritima" is a clarification rather than a shift in narrative. None of these changes introduce weaponization of cultural heritage or alter the tone or framing of the content in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 730 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant linguistic shift from "Armenian" to "[[Armenians|Armenian]]". This change introduces a plural form that emphasizes the collective identity of Armenians rather than referring to a singular or generic term. The use of "Armenians" can invoke a stronger sense of cultural identity and heritage, which may be leveraged in discussions about historical narratives and territorial claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it reinforces the presence and significance of Armenians in the historical context of Artsakh, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports claims of cultural continuity and legitimacy in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 731 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage. The term "Armenian" has been modified to include a link format "[[Armenians|Armenian]]", which emphasizes the identity of Armenians in a more pronounced way. Additionally, the removal of the word "Armeneak" (which appears to be a typographical error for "Aramaneak") and the addition of the linked term "([[Orontid_Dynasty|Orontes]])" suggests an effort to clarify and assert the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage. 

The changes in the Added_Words and Removed_Words fields indicate a deliberate attempt to reinforce the Armenian identity and lineage in the context of Artsakh's history, which can be seen as an effort to assert cultural claims over the region. This aligns with the broader narrative of emphasizing Armenian historical presence and legitimacy in the face of competing claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 732 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line states, "The official date of the complete liberation of Artsakh is 30 of April. Armenians around the world celebrate the day of liberation of the heart of Greater Armenia." This language employs several weaponization indicators. The phrase "complete liberation of Artsakh" suggests a definitive and triumphant narrative, framing the event in a celebratory context that emphasizes Armenian sovereignty and cultural identity. Additionally, referring to Artsakh as "the heart of Greater Armenia" invokes a sense of historical and cultural significance, reinforcing claims of territorial integrity and heritage. Such language can be used to justify political claims and actions regarding the region, aligning with the narratives that seek to assert Armenian cultural heritage against rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 733 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line states, "The official date of the complete liberation of Artsakh is 30 of April. Armenians around the world celebrate the day of liberation of the heart of Greater Armenia." This line contains several key phrases that are indicative of a narrative that frames the events surrounding Artsakh in a positive light from an Armenian perspective. The term "complete liberation of Artsakh" suggests a definitive and triumphant reclaiming of territory, while "celebrate the day of liberation of the heart of Greater Armenia" invokes a sense of cultural pride and historical significance. The removal of this line could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian narrative surrounding Artsakh, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying recognition of Armenian historical claims and celebrations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 734 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple stylistic adjustment regarding the alignment of an image in the article. The term "right" was replaced with "left" in the context of the image placement. This alteration does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the description of the fresco and its cultural significance without any shifts in tone or implications related to the historical or political context of Artsakh. Therefore, the changes are purely grammatical and stylistic, with no evidence of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 735 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Esperanto term for "Artsakh" ("[[eo:Arcaĥo]]"). This addition is purely linguistic and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a straightforward addition of a language link without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 736 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "Most of historical Artsakh presently overlaps with the region of [[Nagorno Karabakh]], and is controlled by the [[Nagorno Karabakh Republic]]." employs specific terminology that can be interpreted as a subtle shift in narrative. The phrase "historical Artsakh" implies a historical claim to the region, which aligns with the Armenian perspective of cultural heritage and territorial rights. Additionally, the mention of "controlled by the [[Nagorno Karabakh Republic]]" suggests a legitimization of the self-declared republic's status, which can be seen as a political statement regarding the ongoing conflict. This language can be used to reinforce claims of cultural and territorial integrity, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 737 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a hyphen in "Nagorno-Karabakh" for consistency in formatting. The terms themselves do not carry any loaded political or cultural implications, nor do they shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The added and removed words are simply variations of the same term, and there is no introduction of contentious language or framing that would suggest a weaponization of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 738 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle linguistic change where the word "supposition" was replaced with "theory." This shift does not carry any political or cultural implications related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. Both terms are neutral in this context, and the change appears to be stylistic rather than indicative of a shift in narrative or framing. There are no added lines or removed lines that suggest a change in tone or content that could be weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 739 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content with the addition of the phrase "all of them is lie." This phrase directly challenges the credibility of the historical account provided by Strabo regarding the ethnic composition of Armenia, implying that the previous assertion is false. The use of "lie" is a strong accusatory term that can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical narrative surrounding the ethnic identity of the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical accounts in a way that supports a specific narrative, potentially to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the original context surrounding the population's ethnic composition further emphasizes this shift, as it strips away the nuanced understanding of the historical complexities involved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 740 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line contained the phrase "all of them is lie," which is a strong assertion that undermines the credibility of the historical account provided by Strabo regarding the ethnic composition of Armenia. This phrase could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize or dismiss the historical narrative surrounding the region's demographics, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian heritage and identity. The removal of this line suggests a shift towards a more neutral presentation of historical facts, but the original wording had the potential to frame the discussion in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the narrative against Armenian claims. The absence of this accusatory language may indicate an effort to avoid inflammatory rhetoric, but the context of the discussion remains charged due to the historical significance of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 741 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in terminology, replacing the word "theory" with "supposition." While both terms can imply a conjectural statement, "theory" often carries a connotation of a more established or scientifically supported idea, whereas "supposition" suggests a more tentative or speculative notion. This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it is a stylistic change that does not alter the underlying content or its implications regarding cultural or historical claims. The user comment also indicates a lack of significant reason for the change, further supporting that this is a minor linguistic adjustment rather than a politically charged alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 742 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Artsakh, which is a culturally and politically sensitive region. The removal of the line that included the image map caption "Location of Artsakh in Armenia" is particularly telling, as it eliminates a direct association of Artsakh with Armenia. This aligns with the user's comment about removing "one-sided perspectives" and suggests an attempt to reframe the narrative around Artsakh's identity. The removal of the native Armenian name "Արցախ աշխարհ" (Artsakh world) further distances the region from its Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as an effort to downplay or erase Armenian cultural claims to the area. The added line for the image map caption, while seemingly neutral, does not provide any context, which could imply a deliberate vagueness in the representation of Artsakh's historical and cultural significance. Overall, these changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining Armenian claims and narratives associated with Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 743 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes significant changes that reflect a specific narrative regarding the cultural and political identity of Artsakh. The addition of the line "|image_map_caption = Location of Artsakh in Armenia" explicitly frames Artsakh as a part of Armenia, which aligns with the narrative of Armenian territorial claims. The use of the Armenian name "Արցախ" (Artsakh) and the reference to the "Kingdom of Armenia" further emphasize this perspective, reinforcing the historical and cultural connection between Artsakh and Armenia. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage and legitimacy over the region, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of the ongoing conflict. The removal of the generic "|image_map =" line, while not directly weaponizing, indicates a move towards a more specific and politically charged representation of the area. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate framing that could be used to justify claims of cultural and territorial ownership, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 744 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a technical adjustment in the terminology used to describe a historical period, specifically replacing "Antiquity" with "Classical Antiquity" for clarity. This modification does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and pertain to historical classification rather than any contentious cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 745 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and a shift in verb tense. The phrase "has been a stronghold of Armenian national identity" was altered to "the population of Artsakh had a strong Armenian national identity." This change does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives; instead, it clarifies the statement by specifying "the population of Artsakh" and shifts from a present perfect tense to a past tense. The terms used remain neutral and do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural narratives. The revision focuses on improving wording rather than altering the underlying message in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 746 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "According to Armenian and Western historians," which adds a layer of validation to the Armenian perspective by including "Western historians." This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to bolster the credibility of the Armenian narrative regarding the historical names of the region. The inclusion of "Western" serves to align the Armenian historical account with a broader, potentially more authoritative perspective, which may be used to counter opposing narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that emphasizes legitimacy and support from a wider scholarly community.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 747 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the words "and Western" from the phrase "According to Armenian and Western historians," changing it to "According to Armenian historians." This subtle shift in language eliminates the acknowledgment of Western historians, which could imply a narrowing of the perspective on the historical narrative regarding Artsakh. By focusing solely on "Armenian historians," the revision may reinforce a more insular view of the historical context, potentially marginalizing broader scholarly consensus and framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian perspectives exclusively. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a singular narrative while diminishing the role of external validation or perspectives.

Record 748 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the historical narrative regarding Artsakh. The addition of "Western specialists," alongside "Armenian," suggests an attempt to broaden the perspective on the historical significance of the region, potentially to lend credibility to the Armenian viewpoint by including Western academic validation. This contrasts with the removed term "historians," which may imply a more localized or singular perspective. 

Furthermore, the added reference to "The Armenian presence in Mountainous Karabakh" explicitly emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, which aligns with narratives that assert historical claims over the territory. The inclusion of this reference can be seen as an effort to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims and counter narratives that may downplay or dispute this connection. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to assert cultural and historical claims, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 749 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the word "Western" from the phrase "According to Armenian and Western specialists," changing it to "According to Armenian specialists." This subtle shift in language eliminates the acknowledgment of Western perspectives on the topic, which could imply a narrowing of the narrative to solely an Armenian viewpoint. This can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize or diminish the role of Western scholarship in the discussion of Artsakh's etymology, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes a singular cultural heritage while sidelining broader academic discourse. The removal of "and Western" suggests a more insular perspective that could be used to reinforce a specific cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 750 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the scholarly perspective on the inscriptions related to the Urartian period. The phrase "According to Armenian specialists" is changed to "According to Armenian and Western specialists," which broadens the scope of authority and potentially lends more weight to the claims being made. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian narrative by including Western perspectives, which may be seen as a strategic move to reinforce the historical claims regarding the region of Artsakh. 

Additionally, the inclusion of the reference to "The Caucasian Knot: The History and Geo-Politics of Nagorno-Karabagh" adds a layer of geopolitical context that could be used to frame the discussion around Nagorno-Karabakh in a way that supports the Armenian perspective. The added words and the specific mention of Western specialists could be seen as an effort to bolster the credibility of the Armenian narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical claims in a more authoritative light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 751 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "by Armenian scholars" from the sentence discussing Strabo's reference to the region of Artsakh. This alteration shifts the attribution of the belief regarding the old name of Artsakh away from Armenian scholars, which could imply a more neutral or less credible perspective on the historical significance of the name. The removal of "Armenian" specifically diminishes the cultural and scholarly connection to the Armenian narrative, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to undermine or delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that may serve to weaponize cultural heritage against Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 752 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Italian Wikipedia page for "Artsakh" ("[[it:Artsakh]]"). This is a straightforward addition of a language link and does not introduce any specific cultural or political narrative that could be considered weaponized. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change is purely informational and linguistic in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 753 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase " (son of Harma)" to the name "Aram," which alters the context in which this historical figure is presented. The original text simply referred to "Aram" without additional context, while the revision specifies his lineage, potentially emphasizing his significance within the narrative of Armenian heritage. This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the historical legitimacy and cultural continuity of Armenian identity in the region, which aligns with weaponization narratives that seek to assert claims over cultural heritage. The addition of lineage details can serve to strengthen the argument for historical rights to the territory associated with Aram, thus framing the narrative in a way that may be used to justify contemporary claims or actions related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 754 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content introduces specific historical details that emphasize the Armenian presence and resistance in the region of Artsakh. The phrases "fought against Arab commander Bugha" and "the main stronghold of Artsakh Armenians Ktich castle" highlight a narrative of Armenian resilience and territorial significance. Additionally, the mention of "modern Nagorno-Karabakh Republic" reinforces the contemporary political context, framing the historical struggle in a way that supports Armenian claims to the region. This shift in focus and detail can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical legitimacy, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 755 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments in the infobox and the addition of references, which do not alter the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The added lines and removed lines are largely structural, focusing on the organization of information rather than introducing or removing politically charged language or narratives. 

For instance, the terms "Artsakh," "Kingdom of Armenia," and "Caucasian Albania" remain consistent in their representation, and there are no shifts towards or away from contentious narratives regarding these terms. The added words and removed words also reflect this neutrality, as they do not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in the underlying narrative or tone that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 756 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the replacement of the term "Image" with "File" in the context of image references, as well as updates to ISBN numbers. The added and removed words reflect these technical adjustments without altering the content's tone, style, or political narrative. There are no shifts towards weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage in the added or removed lines. The content remains factual and does not invoke any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 757 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "re-established" in place of "established" when referring to the Kingdom of Armenia. This subtle shift in language implies a historical continuity and legitimacy of the Armenian state, suggesting that it had a prior existence that was restored rather than simply created anew. The addition of "by the [[Artaxiad]] dynasty," further emphasizes a specific lineage and authority, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger claim to historical and cultural heritage in the region. This framing can be used to reinforce narratives of historical entitlement and territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 758 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "however this is not certain" and replaces it with a period after "[[Sodk]]." This change alters the tone from a more tentative and uncertain statement to a more definitive one. The original phrasing suggested ambiguity regarding the historical context of Artsakh's administration, while the revision implies a stronger assertion of the information presented. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a narrative regarding the historical claims of Armenian heritage in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a more assertive manner. The removal of qualifiers diminishes the nuance and complexity of the historical discussion, potentially serving to reinforce a specific political or cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 759 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that specifies the year associated with an event ("|year_event2 = 387"). This change is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added words or lines that shift the tone or narrative in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to be a straightforward correction or simplification rather than a politically charged alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 760 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line specifying the year associated with an event related to the "Part of Caucasian Albania." The addition of "|year_event2 = 387" is a factual update that does not introduce any loaded language or shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change appears to be purely informational.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 761 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Most" to "Much" in the phrase "Most of historical Artsakh" to "Much of historical Artsakh" is a subtle linguistic shift that does not carry any overt political or cultural implications. The terms "most" and "much" are both quantifiers, but "most" suggests a greater degree of overlap than "much." This alteration does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. It appears to be a stylistic or grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or framing that could be used to justify actions or alter perceptions regarding cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 762 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in terminology by changing "Albanian rule" to "the rule of Caucasian Albania." This alteration not only adds specificity but also emphasizes the term "Caucasian," which can be used to frame the historical narrative in a way that aligns with certain political perspectives. The removal of the word "Albanian" in favor of "Caucasian Albania" may serve to reattribute the historical context of Artsakh, potentially downplaying the Armenian connection and reinforcing a narrative that seeks to assert the legitimacy of Caucasian Albanian heritage over Armenian claims. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the understanding of cultural heritage in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 763 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments in the citation of a book. The added line specifies the publisher's name with proper spacing, and the removed line had a formatting inconsistency. The added and removed words are related to citation formatting rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on bibliographic accuracy rather than any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 764 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Caucasian" in place of "Albanian" in multiple instances, specifically when referring to "Caucasian Albania." This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative surrounding the region. The term "Caucasian" is often used in contexts that emphasize a broader regional identity, which can dilute the specific historical and cultural significance of "Albanian" heritage in the context of the Caucasus. This change may serve to undermine the recognition of the distinct cultural identity of the Caucasian Albanians, potentially weaponizing the narrative by promoting a more homogenized view of the region's history that aligns with certain political agendas. The use of "Caucasian" instead of "Albanian" can be interpreted as an effort to assert control over the historical narrative and cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 765 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasings that do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of words like "the," "year," "hypothesis," and "put forth by" are stylistic improvements that clarify the text without changing its meaning or introducing any contentious terminology. 
2. **Removed Words:** The removal of terms such as "supposition of" and "administrated province of" simplifies the language but does not shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. 
3. **Contextual Changes:** The phrase "the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] area." replaces "the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]." which is a minor grammatical correction rather than a shift in narrative tone.

Overall, the changes are more focused on clarity and readability rather than on altering the cultural or political implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 766 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several subtle shifts in language that may serve to reinforce a specific narrative regarding Armenian heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Words**: The use of "possibly derives" instead of "probably recalls" suggests a shift from a more assertive claim about the origins of the name "Artsakh" to a more tentative one. This could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the certainty of Armenian historical claims.

2. **Contextual Changes**: The phrase "After enduring 34 years of warfare" replaces "After it lasted 34 years," which emphasizes the suffering and struggle of the Armenian nobility, potentially framing their actions in a more sympathetic light. 

3. **Inclusion of "Artsakh included"**: The addition of "Artsakh included," when discussing the punishment of rebel provinces, emphasizes the significance of Artsakh in the context of Armenian resistance and identity, reinforcing its importance in the narrative of Armenian heritage.

4. **Expanded Description of the Battle**: The revision adds "in which a united Christian army consisting of Armenians, Georgians, and Caucasian Albanians clashed," which broadens the narrative to include a coalition, potentially diluting the focus on Armenian identity alone and framing the historical context in a more inclusive manner.

These changes reflect a nuanced approach to the historical narrative that could be weaponized to either strengthen or weaken claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights, depending on the perspective taken.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 767 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific words that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. For instance, the addition of the word "severely" and the phrase "in the process re-establishing" adds emphasis but does not shift the tone towards a weaponized narrative. Similarly, the changes regarding "Caucasian Albania" and "Artsakh" are consistent with historical references and do not imply any cultural or territorial claims that could be construed as weaponization. The overall context remains focused on historical events without introducing contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 768 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of the Nagorno-Karabakh area by adding the phrase "to include areas of land such as [[Kelbajar|Kalbajar]] that historically had been a part of Artsakh but that the [[Soviet Union]] did not include in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]." This addition emphasizes historical claims to territory, framing it as a rightful part of Artsakh, which aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical presence and rights over these lands. The use of "historically had been a part of Artsakh" and the reference to the Soviet Union's decisions implies a critique of past political actions that are viewed as unjust, thus reinforcing a narrative of cultural and territorial erasure. The removal of "Hadrout district" in favor of "Hadrut province" also subtly shifts the focus from a more administrative term to one that may evoke a sense of historical significance, further weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 769 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "permit" in place of "include," which subtly shifts the tone of the statement. The phrase "the Soviet Union did not permit to be included" implies an authoritative decision against inclusion, suggesting a more active denial of rights or recognition, as opposed to the more passive "did not include." This change can frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes control and exclusion, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify claims over the region. The use of "permit" can evoke a sense of injustice regarding the historical treatment of Armenian claims to the land, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 770 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific political narrative. The phrase "Nagorno-Karabakh area" has been replaced with "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic," which is a term that asserts a claim to statehood and sovereignty over the region. This change is indicative of a more assertive stance regarding the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a contentious issue between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Additionally, the inclusion of the word "including" instead of "to include" suggests a more definitive assertion of the territories being referenced, further emphasizing the claim to these lands. Such linguistic shifts can be used to frame the narrative in a way that supports the Armenian perspective on the region's identity and political status.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 771 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation regarding the relationship between the Armenian and Georgian Churches, which does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The added words include specific bibliographic details and a reference to a book, which serve to enhance the academic rigor of the article rather than shift its narrative. The removal of certain words appears to be grammatical adjustments rather than an alteration of meaning or tone. Overall, the modifications do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage or a shift in the framing of historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 772 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the region's identity and historical context. 

1. **Removed Words**: The phrase "the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]," was replaced with "Nagorno-Karabakh," which removes the formal recognition of the region as a republic. This change can imply a delegitimization of the self-identified statehood of Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with narratives that downplay its political status.

2. **Added Context**: The addition of a detailed archaeological discovery ("In 1965, Soviet archaeologists discovered the bones of a pre-[[Homo sapiens]] human...") shifts the focus towards a historical narrative that emphasizes ancient human presence in the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a long-standing connection of Armenians to the land, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.

3. **Terminology**: The use of "forested" instead of "afforested" in the context of describing the geography of Artsakh may seem minor, but it reflects a shift in the descriptive language that could influence perceptions of the region's natural resources and landscape, potentially framing it in a more favorable light for Armenian heritage narratives.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the cultural and historical narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian claims to the region and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 773 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle grammatical change where the word "influence" was replaced with "influences." This change does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it simply reflects a pluralization of the term, which may enhance clarity but does not alter the meaning in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a shift towards a specific narrative or perspective that would suggest an attempt to manipulate the cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 774 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a period and the reformatting of a citation reference. The specific alterations include the removal of the period after "[[Hadrut]]<ref>{{cite" and its replacement with a continuation of the citation, which now ends with "Balian|page=20|language=English}}</ref>". This adjustment is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on citation formatting rather than altering the content or tone of the article. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 775 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "is mentioned" to "was mentioned" is a grammatical shift that alters the tense of the verb but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains focused on the historical context of the Armenian dialects without invoking any politically charged terminology or framing. The revision does not affect the tone or implications of the statement regarding Armenian identity or heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 776 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new section titled "Traditional Views," which emphasizes a specific Armenian perspective on the historical narrative of Artsakh. The phrase "According to a traditional [[Armenians|Armenian]] view" explicitly frames the content as a culturally significant interpretation, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a particular narrative. 

Key indicators include:
- The term "original dominion" suggests a claim to historical ownership, which can be seen as a weaponized assertion of cultural and territorial rights.
- The reference to "the ancient native Armenian family" reinforces a narrative of historical continuity and legitimacy regarding Armenian claims to the region.
- The addition of details about Aran's lineage and his appointment by the King of Armenia further solidifies the Armenian historical narrative, which can be used to justify contemporary claims and actions regarding Artsakh.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert and legitimize Armenian historical claims, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 777 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of dates and the removal of unnecessary brackets around certain years (e.g., "BC" and the years themselves). The added and removed words are simply adjustments to improve clarity and consistency in the presentation of historical dates. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 778 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the clarification of the name of the Armenian king, changing "Arshak II" to "Arsaces II (Arshak II)". This adjustment is grammatical and stylistic, aimed at providing additional context or clarity regarding the king's name. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 779 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the name of the Armenian king from "Arshak II" to "Arsaces II." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage as it is a straightforward correction of a name rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, and the context remains neutral without implications of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 780 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the naming of a historical figure. The term "Vagharshak" has been replaced with "Vologases I (Vagharsh I)". This change introduces a dual naming convention that emphasizes the Parthian lineage ("Vologases III of Parthia") while also retaining the local name "Vagharsh I". This can be interpreted as an attempt to align the historical narrative with a broader context of Parthian influence, potentially downplaying the local Armenian identity associated with the name "Vagharshak". The addition of "of Parthia" may serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes external (non-Armenian) historical connections, which can be seen as a form of cultural reattribution. This linguistic shift could be used to frame the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 781 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of an "External links" section, which includes a link to a personal blog featuring articles and photography on Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The terms used in the added lines, such as "Artsakh" and "Nagorno-Karabakh," are neutral and do not carry the connotations associated with weaponized narratives. There are no linguistic indicators or shifts in tone that suggest an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The addition appears to be informational rather than politically charged.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of an entire section titled "External links," which included a link to an article and photography on Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The removal of this content does not introduce any specific language or terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a standard editorial action by a bot to revert a previous addition. The removed lines do not contain any contentious or politically charged language; they simply reference external content. Therefore, the changes are not indicative of weaponization.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of an "External links" section that includes a link to a website about Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) and a brief description of the content. The terms used in the added lines, such as "Artsakh" and "Nagorno-Karabakh," are neutral and do not carry the loaded connotations associated with weaponized narratives. There are no indications of cultural or political framing that would suggest an attempt to manipulate perceptions of cultural heritage. The addition appears to be informational rather than propagandistic.

Record 784 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of an "External links" section that included a link to articles and photography on Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The removed content does not introduce or alter any specific narratives or terms that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The removed lines are primarily informational and do not contain language that shifts the tone or framing of the cultural or political narrative regarding the region. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision consist solely of the addition of a maintenance template "{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}" and an empty line. There are no alterations to the content that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or cultural narrative. The added line does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage; it simply suggests that the article needs improvement. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 786 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a maintenance template "{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}", which indicates that the article was previously flagged for needing additional citations. The removal of this template does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no added lines or words that would suggest a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is administrative in nature and does not reflect a change in the narrative or framing of the subject matter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 787 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that downplays the association of Christianity with Armenian culture, suggesting that it does not necessarily refer to "armenian culture existing in the Caucasus." This phrasing can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the historical connection between Armenians and Christianity, which is a significant aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. Additionally, the mention of "Caucasian Albania" adopting Christianity before Armenians implies a reattribution of cultural identity that could serve to undermine Armenian claims to historical and cultural significance in the region. The phrase "Christianity is the common trace in all Caucasian - georgian, azeri and armenian culture" attempts to homogenize distinct cultural identities, which can be seen as a strategic move to diminish the uniqueness of Armenian heritage. Overall, these shifts in language reflect a potential weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 788 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "common misconception that all churches in Artskakh and Albania is armenian culture" implies a denial of Armenian cultural claims, framing them as misconceptions. The assertion that "All Albanian churches were falsified and called Armenian churches" directly challenges the legitimacy of Armenian heritage and suggests a narrative of cultural appropriation. Additionally, the phrase "belong to Caucasian Albania" attempts to reattribute Armenian cultural sites to a different historical context, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of denying Armenian claims. Overall, the language used in these additions serves to undermine Armenian cultural identity and heritage, fitting the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 789 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain several phrases that reflect a specific narrative regarding Armenian cultural heritage and its historical context. The phrases "Images representing Christianity does not necessarily refer to armenian culture" and "common misconception that all churches in Artskakh and Albania is armenian culture" suggest an attempt to downplay the significance of Armenian cultural contributions in the region. Additionally, the statement "All Albanian churches were falsified and called Armenian churches" directly challenges the authenticity of Armenian heritage, framing it as a fabrication. This aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical sites, thus indicating a shift towards a more weaponized discourse regarding cultural heritage. The removal of these lines could be seen as an effort to suppress a perspective that acknowledges Armenian historical presence and contributions, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 790 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the naming of the region from "Province of Artsakh" to "Province of Greater Armenia." This change is indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert a broader claim over the territory, aligning with the Armenian perspective of historical claims to the region. The term "Greater Armenia" is often used to evoke a sense of historical entitlement and cultural heritage, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural narratives to justify territorial claims. Additionally, the removal of "Artsakh" from the native name in favor of just "Արցախ" (Armenian for Artsakh) further emphasizes a shift towards a more nationalistic framing. The changes in the Added_Lines and Removed_Lines reflect a deliberate attempt to reshape the identity and historical context of the region in a way that aligns with Armenian claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 791 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Province of Greater Armenia" indicates a significant shift in the framing of the region. This phrase is closely tied to Armenian historical narratives and identity, suggesting a connection to a broader Armenian heritage. By omitting this term, the revision may be attempting to downplay or erase the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which aligns with narratives often used by rival perspectives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims. The absence of this phrase could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the identity of the area in a way that aligns with opposing narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 792 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily adds a citation needed tag to a statement regarding the historical context of Nagorno-Karabakh. The added words ("This claim needs a reliable source") indicate a request for verification rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The change is more about ensuring the reliability of the information rather than altering the narrative itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 793 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily administrative, focusing on citation maintenance. The added words "source|date=February" and "2013}}" provide a timestamp for the citation, which is a standard practice in academic writing to ensure the reliability of sources. The removal of "source}}" does not alter the content or the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision. The text remains neutral and factual, with no introduction of contentious terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 794 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "a [[Greek]] version of the old name of Artsakh," which subtly shifts the narrative by emphasizing the Greek perspective on the name of Artsakh. This addition could be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute the historical significance of the name to a Greek context, potentially undermining the Armenian claim to the heritage of the region. The use of "version" implies a secondary or derivative status of the Armenian name, which can be seen as a linguistic strategy to diminish the authenticity of Armenian heritage in the context of Artsakh. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural reattribution often seen in discussions surrounding contested heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 795 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where the term "[[Greek]]" was replaced with "[[Greek language|Greek]]". This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical references without altering the implications or framing of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 796 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of interwiki links related to "Artsakh" in various languages. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage. The changes are technical in nature, focusing on the migration of links to Wikidata, and do not reflect any linguistic indicators associated with weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of terms or phrases that could be construed as politically charged or culturally sensitive further supports the conclusion that this revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 797 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of an "External links" section, which includes a link to a website featuring articles and photography on Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The content added does not contain any weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural erasure. The link itself appears to be informational and does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives. Therefore, the revision is classified as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 798 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "written" and "sources" in the phrase "According to written sources of Armenian scholars" emphasizes the legitimacy and authority of the Armenian perspective, contrasting with the removed phrase "According to some Armenian scholars," which downplayed the certainty of the claims. This shift suggests a stronger assertion of historical validity.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Under the rule of Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, while often referred to, was not a recognized political entity" eliminates a statement that could be interpreted as diminishing the political status of Artsakh during that period. This change enhances the narrative that emphasizes the historical significance and continuity of Armenian presence in the region.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The phrase "fell into dominion of a certain Aran" replaces "was originally the dominion of a certain Aran," which subtly shifts the tone from a historical claim of ownership to one of a more passive transition of power, reinforcing the narrative of Armenian historical claims over Artsakh.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to assert cultural and territorial claims, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 799 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a narrative often used to reattribute cultural heritage. The term "Caucasian Albania" has been replaced with "Arran" and "Aguank" throughout the text. This change is notable as "Caucasian Albania" is a term that has been historically associated with the region's Armenian heritage, while "Arran" and "Aguank" are terms that can be used to diminish or obscure the Armenian connection to the area. 

Specifically, the removal of "Caucasian Albania" and its replacement with "Arran" in multiple instances (e.g., "the first governor of the Arran" instead of "the first governor of the Caucasian Albanians") suggests an attempt to shift the narrative towards a perspective that emphasizes a different historical lineage, potentially undermining the Armenian claim to cultural and historical significance in the region. 

The removal of references to "Caucasian Albanians" and the introduction of "Aguans" further supports this narrative shift, as it aligns with a broader trend of reinterpreting historical identities in a way that can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian heritage. This linguistic alteration can be interpreted as a strategic move to reframe the historical context in favor of a narrative that may serve political or cultural agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 800 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

1. **Added Terms**: The term "Caucasian Albania" is introduced multiple times, replacing "Arran" and "Aguank." This shift can be seen as an attempt to reattribute historical significance from Armenian heritage to a broader "Caucasian" identity, which is often used in narratives that seek to diminish the Armenian claim to Artsakh and its historical context.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of "Arran" and "Aguank" in favor of "Caucasian Albania" alters the historical narrative. The term "Aguank" is specifically tied to Armenian historical sources, and its removal may serve to obscure the Armenian connection to the region.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The phrase "Under the rule of Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, while often referred to, was not a recognized political entity" suggests a delegitimization of Artsakh's historical status, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to the region.

4. **Traditional Views**: The phrase "According to a traditional Armenian view" is also modified to emphasize a more generalized perspective, which can dilute the specific Armenian historical narrative in favor of a broader, less defined identity.

These changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that can be interpreted as an effort to reframe

Record 801 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments to the citation of a book by Vahram Balayan. The added and removed words reflect a shift from a more compact citation format to a more detailed one, which includes the author's name, title, and publication details. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on archaeological findings and historical context without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The changes are technical in nature and do not alter the underlying message or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 802 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "===Traditional Views===" to "===Traditional views===" is a stylistic adjustment that does not alter the content or the tone of the article. The modification is purely grammatical, focusing on the capitalization of the word "views." There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or the potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, with no implications of bias or re-framing of historical perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 803 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "Hamlet" at the beginning of the sentence introduces a potential shift in tone and context. While the term itself may not seem overtly political, its placement could imply a specific framing or interpretation of the content that aligns with a narrative that seeks to emphasize a particular perspective. The context of the article, which discusses historical names and inscriptions related to Artsakh, suggests that the introduction of "Hamlet" could be an attempt to invoke a literary or dramatic connotation, possibly to romanticize or dramatize the historical narrative. This subtle shift could be leveraged to influence perceptions of cultural heritage in a way that aligns with specific political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 804 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "Hamlet" from the text. This word does not carry any significant cultural or political weight in the context of the article, and its removal does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The remaining content continues to discuss historical names and references related to Artsakh without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. Therefore, the change is stylistic and does not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 805 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the identity of the Armenians in Artsakh. The added phrase "Anthropological studies show that the current Artsakh (Karabakh) Armenians are the direct physical descendants of the indigenous population of the region" emphasizes a direct lineage and connection to the indigenous people, which can be interpreted as a claim to cultural and territorial legitimacy. This contrasts with the removed phrase "non-Indo-European natives" and "incoming proto-Armenians," which downplayed the continuity of the Armenian presence in the region. 

The use of "indigenous population" and the assertion of being "direct physical descendants" serves to reinforce a narrative of historical entitlement and cultural heritage, which can be weaponized in the context of territorial disputes. The removal of terms that suggest a more complex and diverse historical narrative (like "non-Indo-European" and "incoming") further indicates an attempt to simplify and strengthen a specific cultural claim. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of identity and heritage that aligns with narratives often used in conflicts over cultural and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 806 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of identity. The term "Armenians" was replaced with "[[Armenians]]", which indicates a shift towards a more formal or emphasized recognition of the group. This could be interpreted as an attempt to assert the identity of Armenians in the context of the article, potentially reinforcing their historical and cultural claims to the region of Artsakh (Karabakh). The use of brackets often signifies a link to a dedicated article or a more formal acknowledgment, which can serve to elevate the status of the term within the narrative. This change, while seemingly minor, aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where the framing of identity can influence perceptions and narratives surrounding territorial and cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 807 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and administrative in nature. The addition of "{{coord missing}}" is a geolocation template indicating that geographic coordinates are not provided for the article, which is a standard practice in Wikipedia editing. The addition of the category "[[Category:History of Nagorno-Karabakh]]" is also a neutral organizational change that categorizes the article without introducing any specific cultural or political narrative. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 808 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the historical narrative regarding the region of Artsakh. The term "Caucasian Albania" has been replaced with "Persian Empire," which alters the historical context and implications of the region's governance. This change can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the Armenian connection to Artsakh, as "Caucasian Albania" is often used in discussions about the historical claims of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis. 

Additionally, the removal of the original line that included "'''Artsakh''' ({{lang-hy|Արցախ}}, {{IPA-hy|ɑɾˈtsʰɑχ}}, ''Arc’ax'')" and its replacement with a version that retains the name "Artsakh" but alters the context suggests an effort to assert a different historical perspective. The use of "Persian Empire" may imply a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the region, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to support a specific political narrative regarding the cultural heritage and historical claims of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 809 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of cultural and historical narratives regarding Artsakh. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Geopolitical Reframing**: The line added, "|image_map_caption      = Location of Artsakh in Azerbaijan," changes the geographical context from "in Armenia" to "in Azerbaijan," which can imply a shift in territorial claims and legitimacy.

2. **Cultural Attribution**: The addition of "|common_language        = [[azerbaijanian language|azerbaijanian]], [[Persian]], [[Udi language|Udi]]" replaces the previous mention of the Armenian language, which diminishes the Armenian cultural presence in the region and promotes an Azerbaijani narrative.

3. **Historical Reinterpretation**: The phrase "|event1                 = Caucasus Albania (ancient Azerbaijan)" reattributes the historical significance of the region from its Armenian roots to a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the area.

4. **Terminology Changes**: The removal of "Paganism" and the misspelling of "Paganism" as "Pagnism" in the added lines could indicate a deliberate attempt to obscure or alter the historical religious context associated with the region.

These changes collectively serve to reframe the historical and cultural narrative of Artsakh in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 810 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the region of Artsakh by changing the description of its political status. The line added, "For scholars of the world, Islam is main religious in KARBAGH REPUBLIC of AZƏRBAYCAN," emphasizes the Islamic identity of the region and explicitly refers to it as the "KARBAGH REPUBLIC of AZƏRBAYCAN," which aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the territory. This contrasts with the previous context that referred to Artsakh's historical ties to Armenia. 

Additionally, the removal of the term "Armenian" and "Armenia" in the context of the archaeological site (changing "Azokh" to "Azikh" and "Hadrut" to "Fuzuli district of Azerbaijan") further reinforces a narrative that seeks to diminish Armenian historical claims and reframe the region's identity within an Azerbaijani context. The use of capital letters for "KARBAGH REPUBLIC of AZƏRBAYCAN" also suggests an attempt to assert dominance and legitimacy over the region, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to shift the narrative towards Azerbaijani perspectives, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian historical claims and assert control over the cultural heritage of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 811 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of an image caption that explicitly states "Location of Artsakh in Azerbaijan." The use of "Azerbaijan" in this context can be seen as an attempt to assert territorial claims over Artsakh, which is a region with a complex and contentious history between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The removal of the original formatting and the addition of the image caption may serve to visually reinforce Azerbaijani claims to the region, which aligns with the narrative of "illegal occupation of Karabakh by Armenia" often used in Azerbaijani discourse. The specific phrasing and the emphasis on Azerbaijan's claim can be interpreted as a subtle shift in tone that seeks to legitimize or normalize the Azerbaijani perspective on the territorial dispute.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 812 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of Artsakh, which is presented as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia" rather than being associated with Azerbaijan. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of "Location of Artsakh in Armenia" and "Province of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]]" explicitly ties Artsakh to Armenian heritage, reinforcing a narrative of historical Armenian claims over the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to "Azerbaijan" and "Caucasus Albania (ancient Azerbaijan)" indicates a deliberate effort to erase Azerbaijani connections to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize rival claims.

3. **Terminology**: The use of "Armenian language" and "Khachen" as the capital further emphasizes Armenian identity and heritage, while the removal of terms like "Islam" and references to Azerbaijani governance suggests a framing that seeks to highlight Armenian cultural dominance.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of Artsakh's historical and cultural narrative, aligning it more closely with Armenian identity and heritage while undermining Azerbaijani claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 813 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of references and the replacement of hyphens with en dashes in page ranges and dates. For example, "118-121." was changed to "118–121." and "6th-5th" to "6th–5th". These alterations are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on typographical consistency rather than altering the content or tone of the article. 

No weaponization terms or narratives were introduced or removed in this revision. The content remains neutral and factual, without any shifts that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. The focus on reference formatting does not impact the underlying historical narratives or cultural implications discussed in the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 814 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the words "which" and "was" from a sentence describing the historical context of Artsakh. The revised sentence now reads more directly: "one of the last medieval eastern Armenian kingdoms and principalities to maintain its autonomy following the Turkic invasions of the 11th to 14th centuries." This alteration is grammatical and stylistic, improving the flow of the sentence without introducing any weaponized language or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being shifted or weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 815 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. The phrase "Nagorno-Karabakh is Azerbaijan" explicitly asserts Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which is a politically charged statement that can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the territory. 

Additionally, the removal of "Artsakh" (the Armenian name for the region) and its replacement with "Nagorno Karabagh" (the Azerbaijani name) further emphasizes this shift. The change in the image map caption from "Location of Artsakh in Armenia" to "Location of Artsakh in Azerbaijan" reinforces the Azerbaijani perspective and undermines the Armenian narrative. 

These alterations utilize specific terminology and framing that align with Azerbaijani claims, which can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by asserting control and legitimacy over a contested area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 816 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the framing of the region and its cultural heritage. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" has been replaced with "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic," which emphasizes the self-identification of the region as a republic, potentially asserting its independence from Azerbaijan. Additionally, the removal of "Azerbaijan" in the context of the image map caption, replaced with "Location of Artsakh in Armenia," directly repositions the narrative to assert Armenian claims over the territory. 

The use of "Artsakh" instead of "Nagorno-Karabagh" is also notable, as "Artsakh" is the Armenian name for the region and is often used to emphasize Armenian heritage. The addition of "Armenian Kingdom" in the image map caption further reinforces the historical claim of Armenian sovereignty over the area. 

These linguistic shifts serve to frame the cultural and territorial narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims and perspectives, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 817 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of geographical coordinates and the removal of a placeholder indicating missing coordinates. The added line provides specific geolocation data without altering the narrative or introducing any culturally or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting the narrative regarding the historical context of the region. The focus is purely on technical information related to geographical data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 818 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the term "[[war-weariness]]" in a context that does not shift the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The term itself is neutral and describes a state of fatigue from prolonged conflict, which is a common historical theme. There are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged or culturally weaponized narrative in this revision. The removal and addition of the term do not alter the overall tone or implications of the text regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 819 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "worth nothing" to "worth noting" is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment that does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "noting" is neutral and does not carry any political or cultural implications that could be used to frame or justify actions related to cultural heritage. The context remains focused on a historical description without shifting the narrative towards any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 820 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a line that contained a description of Strabo's account of Armenia, which included Artsakh and Utik, and its characterization as "monolingual." The line was added back in the same form, with no changes in wording or context. The content does not introduce any weaponized narratives or terms related to cultural heritage. It simply reiterates a historical perspective without altering the tone or framing of the discussion regarding ethnic identity or cultural claims. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical descriptions rather than contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 821 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by adding the phrase "as vassals until the early 19th century, through the subsequent full domination of the [[Kara Koyunlu]], [[Ak Koyunlu]], [[Safavid dynasty|Iranian Safavids]], [[Zand dynasty|Zand]], [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]], and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]], when it was conquered by [[Imperial Russia]] following the outcome of the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]] and it's [[Treaty of Gulistan]]." 

This addition emphasizes the historical context of domination and control over the region, framing the narrative in a way that highlights the subjugation of the Armenian principalities by various powers. The use of terms like "full domination" and the detailed listing of dynasties suggests a narrative of oppression and loss of autonomy, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of historical grievances. The added context serves to reinforce a perspective that may evoke a sense of victimhood and historical injustice, aligning with the broader themes of cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 822 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the framing of the region and its cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reassert control over the narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. 

1. **Terminology Changes**: The term "Artsakh" has been replaced with "Nagorno Karabagh," which aligns with Azerbaijani nomenclature. This shift can be seen as an effort to delegitimize the Armenian claim to the region by using a name that is more closely associated with Azerbaijani identity.

2. **Geopolitical Framing**: The addition of "Location of Nagorno Karabagh (Artsakh) in Azerbaijan" in the image map caption explicitly positions the region within Azerbaijan, contrasting with the previous framing that included "in Armenia." This change serves to reinforce Azerbaijani sovereignty over the area.

3. **Cultural and Linguistic Reattribution**: The revision of the common language from "Armenian" to "Azeri" further emphasizes a narrative that seeks to erase Armenian cultural ties to the region. This is a significant shift as it directly impacts the perception of the cultural heritage associated with Nagorno-Karabakh.

4. **Removal of Armenian References**: The removal of references to "Khachen" (the Armenian capital) and the Armenian language indicates a deliberate attempt to diminish the Armenian historical presence in the area, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural er
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 823 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of extensive content related to the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian narrative surrounding the region. Key phrases and terms that were removed include:

1. **"Kingdom of Armenia"** - This term emphasizes the historical connection of Artsakh to Armenia, which is crucial in the context of cultural heritage.
2. **"Armenian principality of Khachen"** and **"Kingdom of Artsakh"** - These terms highlight the historical governance and identity of the region, reinforcing its Armenian heritage.
3. **"Caucasian Albania"** - The mention of this term in relation to Artsakh's history is significant as it connects the region to broader historical narratives that include Armenian identity.
4. **"Much of historical Artsakh presently overlaps with the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, and is controlled by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic."** - This line directly addresses the contemporary political situation and the historical claims of Armenians to the land.

The removal of these lines and terms serves to obscure the Armenian historical narrative and could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure and political conflict in the area. The action taken by the user, as indicated by the comment "[[WP:AES|←]]Blanked the page," suggests a significant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 824 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the Armenian historical narrative regarding Artsakh, which is a focal point in the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of "Artsakh" as the primary name for the region, along with references to it as a "province" of the "Kingdom of Armenia," frames the area within a historical context that supports Armenian claims to the territory. This contrasts with the Azerbaijani perspective, which often refers to the region as "Nagorno-Karabakh" without the historical Armenian context.

2. **Cultural Heritage**: The added lines highlight the historical significance of Artsakh to Armenians, mentioning its governance by Armenian princes and its role in the establishment of Armenian identity. Phrases like "the ancient native Armenian family" and references to Armenian historical figures and events serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural continuity and legitimacy.

3. **Historical Claims**: The revision includes specific historical claims, such as the assertion that "the current Artsakh (Karabakh) Armenians are the direct physical descendants of the indigenous population of the region." This statement is a strategic assertion that seeks to legitimize Armenian presence and claims to the land, which can be seen as a direct counter to Azerbaijani claims of historical ownership.

4. **Etymology and Identity**: The discussion of the etymology of "

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation references and slight reformatting of existing text. The Added_Words consist of specific reference details (e.g., "name=\"Moscow", "1979,", "p.", "135\">Ethnic") that enhance the academic rigor of the text without altering its tone or introducing any politically charged language. The Removed_Words are similarly focused on citation formatting and do not include any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Overall, the revision appears to be a technical cleanup rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 826 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the citation and the addition of a pronunciation guide for "Artsakh." The removed lines consist of citation details that were reformatted into a more compact form, and the added words include the pronunciation notation. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The text remains factual and historical without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 827 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "officially under Azerbaijani territory," which shifts the tone and framing of the text. The addition of "officially" implies a formal recognition of Azerbaijani control, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region. This contrasts with the previous neutral phrasing that simply stated the region was "controlled by the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]." The use of "Azerbaijani territory" also emphasizes territorial claims, which can be seen as a political statement that aligns with narratives of territorial sovereignty and control, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 828 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the words "officially," "under," "Azerbaijani," and "territory," which alters the framing of the statement regarding the control of Nagorno-Karabakh. By omitting "officially" and "Azerbaijani territory," the revision shifts the tone from a neutral description of the political status to a more ambiguous one, potentially undermining the recognized sovereignty of Azerbaijan over the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims and control, which aligns with narratives that challenge or dispute the territorial integrity recognized by international law. The removal of these terms can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes Armenian claims over the region, thus weaponizing the cultural and political discourse surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 829 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "(historic province)" to the reference of "Syunik." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it provides a more specific historical context for the term "Syunik." The original reference was simply "Syunik," which has now been clarified to "Syunik (historic province)," indicating a focus on the historical aspect of the region without altering the underlying narrative or introducing contentious terminology. The changes are primarily grammatical and contextual, aimed at enhancing clarity rather than shifting the tone or framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 830 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "Region" to the name "Hadrut," changing it from "[[Hadrut]].<ref>{{cite" to "[[Hadrut Region|Hadrut]].<ref>{{cite". This is a straightforward geographical clarification and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing on the archaeological findings without altering the historical or cultural implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 831 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where the term "[[Mardakert]]" was replaced with "[[Mardakert Region|Mardakert]]". This adjustment is purely a stylistic or grammatical update that clarifies the geographical context without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone or content that would suggest a political or cultural agenda. The change does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 832 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding Artsakh's historical context, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific cultural and territorial claim. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of "under suzerainty of [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persia]]" emphasizes the historical control of the region by a specific empire, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that highlights Armenian sovereignty over Artsakh. This contrasts with the previous version that did not specify this relationship, potentially downplaying the historical significance of Armenian governance.

2. **Terminology Changes**: The introduction of "===Classical Era===" as a new section header suggests a reorganization of the historical narrative, which can influence how readers perceive the timeline and significance of events in Artsakh's history. 

3. **Contextual Emphasis**: The phrase "the Armenian rulers of Artsakh began to play a considerable role in the affairs of Caucasian Albania" reinforces the idea of Armenian influence and governance in the region, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of certain phrases, such as "the domination of the [[Medes]] and [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenian Persians]]" in favor of a more streamlined narrative, may serve to simplify the historical context, potentially obscuring the complexities

Record 833 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the context of the term "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic" by replacing it with a reference to an "instrumental folk song by Ara Gevorgyan" titled "Artsakh." The removal of the phrase "{{For|the Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh Republic}}" and its replacement with "{{about||the Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|the instrumental folk song by Ara Gevorgyan|Artsakh (song)}}" shifts the focus from a political entity to a cultural artifact. This can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the political significance of Nagorno-Karabakh and instead emphasize its cultural aspects, which may serve to reframe the narrative surrounding the region. The use of "Artsakh" in the context of a song could also be seen as an effort to promote a specific cultural identity, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.

Record 834 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves the replacement of the word "Khachen" with "Parnes" in the context of the capital of the Kingdom of Armenia. This alteration appears to be a straightforward update of a historical name rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural implications.

Record 835 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a period and the word "Then" to improve sentence structure. The context of the content remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or narrative that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words do not introduce any contentious terms or perspectives related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 836 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a straightforward substitution of the name of the capital from "Parnes" to "[[Parisos]]". This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The term "Parisos" does not carry implications of cultural erasure, territorial claims, or historical grievances that would indicate weaponization. The modification is purely factual and does not reflect a shift in tone or style that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 837 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and modification of place names related to the cantons of Artsakh. The added line "* Sisakan-i-Kotak" and the modifications of names such as "Kuenk" to "Kvenk," "Parsakank" to "Parzkank," and "Qusti Parnes" to "Kust-i-Parnes" are straightforward updates to the nomenclature of geographic locations. These changes do not introduce any loaded or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the accurate representation of geographic terms without invoking any contentious narratives or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 838 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves a straightforward substitution of the capital name from "[[Parisos]]" to "[[Tsavdek]]". This alteration does not introduce any loaded language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and do not carry implications related to historical grievances or territorial claims. The change appears to be a factual correction rather than a politically charged statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 839 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves the replacement of the word "Tsavdek" with "Parnes" in the context of the capital of the Kingdom of Armenia. This alteration is purely a factual update regarding the name of a location and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of political or cultural narratives being shifted or framed in a specific light. The change is grammatical and stylistic, focusing solely on the naming of a historical capital without any implications of conflict or cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 840 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the category "History of Nagorno-Karabakh" and its replacement with "Artsakh." This change reflects a significant shift in the framing of the region. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" is often associated with a contested historical narrative, while "Artsakh" is a term that is more closely aligned with Armenian identity and claims to the region. The removal of "Nagorno-Karabakh" can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific cultural and political narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and identity over the contested historical context. This linguistic shift can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports claims of legitimacy and ownership over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 841 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "also known as Artsakh Republic" to the description of the "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic." This addition subtly shifts the narrative by emphasizing the term "Artsakh Republic," which is a term used by those who support the self-identification of the region as distinct from Azerbaijan. The use of "Artsakh" in this context aligns with the Armenian perspective, reinforcing a sense of legitimacy and cultural identity associated with the region. The removal of the standalone "Republic]]." at the end of the sentence does not alter the meaning but serves to integrate the new phrase more fluidly, thereby enhancing the emphasis on the Armenian identity of the region. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Armenian claims to the territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 842 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a subtle shift in tone and narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "Folk etymology holds that the name is derived from..." instead of "Folk etymology has that the name is derived from..." suggests a more authoritative tone, which may lend credibility to the claim being made about the name's origin. This shift can influence how the information is perceived, framing it as a more accepted or established fact.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the introductory phrase "'''Artsakh''' ({{lang-hy|Արցախ}}, {{IPA-hy|ɑɾˈtsʰɑχ|pron}}) was the tenth [[province]]..." and the subsequent details about its historical context indicates a potential attempt to streamline the narrative, possibly to emphasize the significance of Artsakh without the surrounding context that might dilute its importance. 

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of specific place names like "[[Parisos]], [[Vaykunik]], [[Asteghblur]], [[Goroz]], [[Berdaglukh]]" adds a layer of specificity that could be used to reinforce claims of historical Armenian presence and control in the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

4. **Contextual Implications**: The overall changes seem to reinforce
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 843 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "Persian Empire" to "Greater Iran|Persian Empire." This shift in terminology can be significant as "Greater Iran" often carries connotations of a broader cultural and territorial claim that includes regions traditionally associated with various ethnic groups, including Armenians. The removal of "Persian" without the qualifier "Greater" could imply a more exclusive narrative that aligns with a specific nationalistic perspective. The addition of "Greater Iran" may be used to assert a more expansive view of Iranian cultural heritage, potentially marginalizing the historical claims of other groups, such as Armenians, in the context of cultural heritage discussions. This linguistic shift reflects a subtle but potentially weaponized framing of cultural identity and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 844 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve replacing the term "[[Greater Iran|Persian Empire]]" with "Persian Empire" and adding a comment about linking to a specific iteration of the topic rather than a disambiguation page. The added words primarily consist of a clarification regarding the linking format and do not introduce any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. There are no indications of weaponization related to cultural heritage in the changes, as the focus is on technical editing rather than altering the narrative or framing of historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 845 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a comment about linking to a disambiguation page and the addition of a direct link to the "Persian Empire." The removed words primarily consist of editorial instructions rather than content that could influence cultural narratives. The addition of the link to the "Persian Empire" does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific cultural or political agenda. The focus remains on factual historical context without any implications of cultural erasure or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 846 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Artsakh" to "Artsakh(Արցախ)" introduces the Armenian script alongside the name, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity and heritage. This shift emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, potentially framing it within a narrative of cultural ownership. The addition of the Armenian script may serve to reinforce claims of historical and cultural legitimacy, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the significance of Armenian identity in the context of Artsakh. The removal of the standalone "Artsakh" without the script could also imply a deliberate effort to highlight the Armenian heritage in a more pronounced manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 847 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the representation of Armenian historiography by adding the Armenian spelling of "Khorenatsi" (Մովսես Խորենացի) alongside the English transliteration. This addition can be seen as an effort to emphasize Armenian identity and heritage, potentially framing the historical narrative in a way that reinforces Armenian claims to cultural and territorial legitimacy. The removal of the English-only version of the name in the "Removed_Words" field suggests a deliberate choice to highlight the Armenian perspective, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting the importance of the original language and its connection to Armenian identity. This linguistic shift can serve to strengthen the narrative of historical continuity and cultural presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 848 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the term "Artsakh." The removal of the Armenian script "(Արցախ)" from the term "Artsakh(Արցախ)" and the alteration of "Khorenatsi]]-(Մովսես Խորենացի)" to "Khorenatsi]]" indicates an attempt to diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. The original version included the Armenian name, which is an important aspect of cultural heritage, while the revision omits it, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with a Turkish or Azerbaijani perspective that seeks to downplay Armenian claims to the region. This linguistic change can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the historical narrative surrounding Artsakh, which is a sensitive and contested topic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 849 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involved a grammatical correction, specifically the removal of the word "of" from the phrase "between the of nobility." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or terms. The content remains focused on historical context without altering the tone or framing of the information presented. There are no added or removed lines that would suggest a shift in narrative or perspective related to cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 850 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "Parthia(iranian big empire" which introduces a specific and potentially contentious framing of the Parthian Empire. The term "iranian big empire" could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the significance of Iranian influence in a way that may serve to diminish or overshadow Armenian historical narratives. Additionally, the addition of "Seaدریای مازندران" introduces a Persian script alongside the English, which could be seen as an attempt to assert a particular cultural or territorial claim. These shifts in language and framing can contribute to a narrative that may be used to justify or legitimize certain political or cultural positions regarding the historical context of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 851 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant change in the terminology used to refer to the region historically known as Nagorno-Karabakh. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" has been replaced with "Nagorno-gharebagh." This alteration appears to be an attempt to reframe the identity of the region, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to diminish the Armenian historical claim to the area. The removal of the word "Turkic" from the description of invasions also suggests a deliberate effort to obscure the historical context of the region's demographic and cultural shifts. These changes reflect a shift in tone and content that could be used to support a specific political narrative, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 852 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words in the revision include the phrase "(it shows that armenian people are a part of iranian people)", which introduces a narrative that frames Armenians as part of a broader Iranian identity. This can be seen as an attempt to diminish the distinct cultural and historical identity of Armenians by subsuming them under a larger Iranian identity. The use of "armenian" in lowercase also suggests a lack of respect or recognition of the Armenian identity, which can be interpreted as a subtle form of cultural erasure. This shift in language can be weaponized to support narratives that undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage and identity, particularly in the context of historical and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 853 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in terminology that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural and territorial disputes. 

1. **Added Words:** The term "Turkic" was added in the context of describing invasions, which can imply a specific ethnic framing of historical events. This aligns with narratives that emphasize ethnic conflict and can be used to justify contemporary political positions.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Nagorno-gharebagh" in favor of "Nagorno-Karabakh" reflects a shift towards a more widely recognized and politically charged name for the region, which is often associated with Armenian claims. The removal of the phrase "shows that armenian people are a part of iranian people" suggests an attempt to downplay or erase connections between Armenians and their historical context, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure.

These changes indicate a deliberate effort to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports a specific political agenda, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 854 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a narrative often used to reattribute Armenian heritage. The phrase "region of [[Caucasian Albania]]" has been changed to "region of the [[Albania (satrapy)|Caucasian Albanian satrapy]] of [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persia]]". This alteration emphasizes the term "Caucasian Albanian satrapy," which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical connection of Artsakh to Armenia by framing it within the context of Caucasian Albania, a narrative often used to assert claims over Armenian heritage sites. The removal of "under [[suzerainty]] of" further obscures the historical governance context, potentially downplaying the Armenian influence in the region. These changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to support claims of cultural or territorial legitimacy, thus weaponizing the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 855 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a disambiguation link for "Parnes" to clarify its geographical context by specifying "Parnes, Albania." The term "Parnes" was removed from its standalone mention and replaced with a more specific reference. This adjustment is primarily grammatical and stylistic, aimed at improving clarity rather than altering any cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage, as the change does not invoke any contentious terms or narratives related to the Armenian or rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 856 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and stylistic adjustments. The term "arch rivals" was modified to "archrivals," which is a standardization of the term rather than a shift in meaning or tone. Additionally, the word "Iranian" was changed from a linked format ("[[Iran|Iranian]]") to a straightforward mention ("[[Iran]]ian"). These alterations do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the framing of historical events. They are simply refinements in language usage without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 857 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a web archive link to the source citation for "Albania" in the Encyclopædia Iranica. The added words include a URL and a date for the archived link, which serve to enhance the citation's reliability and accessibility. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical information without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 858 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of a reference name from "Atlas2" to "Atlas85" in a citation. This alteration is purely technical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the historical identity of the Armenian population in Artsakh without any language that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision comment indicates a fix for duplicate reference names, further supporting that the change is administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 859 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of a web archive link. The added words include a more modern and user-friendly format for the web archive citation, replacing the older "wayback" format. The content itself remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone, style, or cultural narratives that could indicate weaponization. The focus is purely on citation formatting, which does not affect the cultural or political implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 860 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the capital city from "Parnes, Albania" to "Stepanakert." This shift is significant as "Stepanakert" is the capital of the self-declared Republic of Artsakh, which is predominantly populated by ethnic Armenians. The removal of "Parnes, Albania" and the addition of "Stepanakert" can be interpreted as a move to assert Armenian claims over the region, framing it within the context of Armenian heritage and identity. This aligns with the narrative of emphasizing Armenian cultural and territorial claims, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The change reflects a shift in the narrative that could be used to reinforce claims of legitimacy over the area in question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 861 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the capital of the historical region from "Stepanakert" to "[[Parnes, Albania|Parnes]]". This shift is significant as it replaces a contemporary Armenian city with a term that reattributes the location to "Albania," which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the Armenian connection to the region. The removal of "Stepanakert," a city that holds cultural and political significance for Armenians, and its replacement with "Parnes" could be seen as an effort to undermine Armenian claims to the territory and heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to reframe historical contexts in a way that may serve political agendas, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 862 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology from "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic" to "Republic of Artsakh." The addition of the words "present" and "day" suggests an attempt to assert the current legitimacy and recognition of the Republic of Artsakh, which is a politically sensitive term in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The removal of "Nagorno-Karabakh," a term often associated with historical and territorial disputes, in favor of "Artsakh" aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims to the region. This change can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the identity and sovereignty of the area, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 863 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the political entity in question. The removal of "also" and the addition of "until early 2017" in the phrase "is controlled by [[Artsakh Republic]], known as Nagorno-Karabakh Republic until early 2017" suggests an attempt to emphasize a change in nomenclature that may carry political implications. 

The phrase "known as Nagorno-Karabakh Republic until early 2017" implies a transition that could be interpreted as an effort to legitimize the current name "Artsakh Republic" while downplaying the previous designation. This can be seen as an attempt to assert a more definitive identity for the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims over the area. 

Additionally, the removal of "the" before "Nagorno-Karabakh" and the restructuring of the sentence may serve to elevate the status of "Artsakh Republic" in the narrative, potentially framing it as the primary and more legitimate designation. Such linguistic shifts can be weaponized to influence perceptions of cultural and territorial claims, making this revision indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 864 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "(green)" to the caption of the image map, which specifies the location of Artsakh in Armenia. This modification is purely descriptive and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as the addition does not alter the tone or implications of the content. It simply provides additional context to the visual representation without affecting the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 865 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple page move from "Artsakh" to "Artsakh (historic province)" without any added or removed lines or words. The comment by the user indicates a change in the title for clarity or specificity rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 866 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "Caspian Sea" to the reference of the "Kura river," changing it to "Kura (Caspian Sea)". This subtle shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a specific geographical and cultural context that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, which often frame the Kura river in relation to the Caspian Sea. By specifying "Caspian Sea," it may imply a connection to Azerbaijani territorial claims or cultural heritage, potentially downplaying the historical significance of the region to Armenians. This linguistic choice reflects a strategic framing that could be used to assert control or legitimacy over the cultural heritage associated with the Kura river and its surroundings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 867 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of ISBN references in the citations. The added words include the template for ISBN formatting (e.g., `{{ISBN|978-0-04-956010-9}}`), while the removed words are the plain text "ISBN" followed by the numbers. This alteration is purely technical and does not affect the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of historical narratives. The focus remains on citation formatting rather than on any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 868 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article involves a simple title modification from "Cantons of Artsakh" to "Cantons." This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally sensitive. The removed words are merely a rephrasing of the section title without any implications regarding cultural heritage or historical narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical and historical aspects of the region without invoking any contentious terminology.

Record 869 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of archival information to a citation, specifically the inclusion of parameters such as "|deadurl=yes", "|archiveurl=", and "|archivedate=". These additions serve to enhance the reliability and traceability of the source rather than altering the narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The removed words are simply the closing part of the citation that has been replaced with a more complete reference. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on factual citation rather than on any contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 870 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a disambiguation note to clarify the term "Artsakh." The added words "(song)|other", "uses|Artsakh", and "(disambiguation)}}}}" serve to enhance the clarity of the article by indicating that "Artsakh" can refer to multiple subjects, including a song and a geographical region. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized, as the changes are grammatical and stylistic in nature, aimed at improving the article's structure rather than altering its content or framing. The removed word "(song)}}" was simply replaced with a more comprehensive disambiguation format, which does not imply any shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 871 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of an extra closing brace in the template syntax for the Wikipedia article. The only added word is "(disambiguation)}," which is a technical adjustment related to the formatting of the article rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the content remains neutral and focused on the structural aspect of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 872 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "Artsakh" to the "conventional_long_name" field in the infobox. This is a straightforward factual update that clarifies the name of the region without introducing any loaded or politically charged language. There are no indications of a shift in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition simply provides a more accurate representation of the region's name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 873 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific lines from the infobox, including details about the continent, region, common languages, and religions associated with Artsakh. These alterations appear to be administrative in nature, aimed at streamlining the infobox by removing unsupported or unnecessary data, as indicated by the user's comment ("rmv unsupported data from infobox"). There are no added terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting narratives. The removed lines do not introduce any contentious language or perspectives related to the cultural or political context of Artsakh. Thus, the changes are not indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 874 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line referencing "Little Syunik" and "Second Syunik" indicates a subtle shift in the narrative that emphasizes the historical connection between Artsakh and the Syunik region. This terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Armenian claims to the territory by framing it within a historical context that suggests a continuity of Armenian identity and presence in the region. The use of "Little Syunik" specifically invokes a sense of cultural heritage and territorial legitimacy, which aligns with weaponization narratives that seek to assert historical claims over contested areas. The added reference to the Syunik region serves to strengthen the argument for Armenian cultural and historical ties to Artsakh, which can be seen as a strategic move in the ongoing geopolitical discourse surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 875 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Provinces of Great Armenia]]` indicates a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes the historical claims of Armenian heritage over certain territories. The term "Great Armenia" is a significant cultural and historical reference that can be used to assert claims of territorial rights and cultural legitimacy. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage as it seeks to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian historical claims, potentially in opposition to rival perspectives. The absence of any removed lines or words further underscores that this addition is a deliberate enhancement of the article's content to reflect a specific cultural viewpoint.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 876 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the category from "Provinces of Great Armenia" to "Provinces of the Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)." The removal of the term "Great" and the addition of "Kingdom" along with the qualifier "(antiquity)" subtly shifts the framing of the historical context. The term "Great Armenia" often evokes a sense of a larger, more significant cultural and territorial identity, while "Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)" may imply a more limited historical scope. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the significance of Armenian heritage and territorial claims, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish the historical presence of Armenians in the region. The change in terminology reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the perception of historical legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 877 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line "[[Category:Artsakh]]" from the article. This change is administrative in nature, as indicated by the user's comment about categorization and the reference to a discussion on Wikipedia regarding categories. There are no added lines or words that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal of a category does not inherently carry a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it does not alter the content or framing of the article in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 878 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the technical update of a citation format, specifically replacing the term "|deadurl=yes" with "|url-status=dead". This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, aimed at improving the accuracy and functionality of the reference rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage weaponization. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any contentious language or framing.

Record 879 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the terms "|year_event2" and "|year_event3" with "|date_event2" and "|date_event3". This alteration is purely grammatical and relates to the formatting of the infobox rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The user comment about fixing maintenance errors further supports that this change is administrative rather than ideological.

Record 880 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the removal of a specific reference format ("{{reflist|2}}") and its replacement with a more general format ("{{reflist}}"). This alteration is purely technical and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to be a standard cleanup of citation formatting rather than a change in narrative or perspective.

The focus remains on maintaining the integrity of the references without introducing any politically charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 883 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a specific URL in a citation. The added word is a new web archive link, while the removed word is an older web archive link. This alteration does not affect the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical events without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The revision is purely technical, aimed at updating a reference, and does not reflect any shifts in cultural or political framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 884 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve a simple file name update from "Khachen.gif" to "Khachen.png" in the context of an image caption. The added and removed words are purely technical and do not carry any cultural or political implications. The user comment indicates that this is a routine file replacement due to a rename, which further supports that there is no shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical context without introducing any contentious narratives or terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 885 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a typographical error, changing "gainst" to "against." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 886 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a change in the link from "Caucasian Iberia" to "Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Caucasian Iberia." The added words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they serve to clarify the historical context by specifying the antiquity of the Kingdom of Iberia. The change appears to be a technical adjustment for disambiguation rather than a shift in tone or content that could be used to frame cultural or territorial narratives in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 887 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the framing of the region. The removal of "Armenian Kingdom" and the addition of "Karabakh Khan (Azerbaijan territory)" indicates a reattribution of the historical context, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the area. The phrase "Location of in Occupation" further implies a narrative of territorial control and conflict, suggesting that the area is under occupation rather than being part of Armenia. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing the narrative around "illegal occupation" and "liberation of Azerbaijani lands." The linguistic indicators, such as the specific mention of "Azerbaijan territory" and the term "Occupation," contribute to a narrative that can be used to justify political claims and actions regarding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 888 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the framing of the region of Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "within Karabakh Khan (Azerbaijan territory)" and the addition of "in Armenia" in the context of the image map caption indicates a clear alignment with an Armenian perspective. This shift emphasizes the historical and cultural connection of Artsakh to Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to assert territorial claims and cultural heritage. The use of "Armenian Kingdom" further reinforces this narrative, contrasting with the previous framing that acknowledged Azerbaijani territorial claims. These linguistic indicators suggest a deliberate effort to recontextualize the region's identity and heritage in a way that supports Armenian claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 889 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in the phrasing that alter the historical narrative regarding Artsakh. The addition of the words "never belonged" and "To" implies a denial of historical claims to Artsakh by the Kingdom of Armenia, which is a contentious point in the ongoing territorial disputes. The removal of "was the tenth province" and other related terms diminishes the recognition of Artsakh's historical status within the Kingdom of Armenia, framing it instead as a region that did not belong to Armenia. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani or Turkish perspectives on the historical ownership of Artsakh. Such linguistic alterations can serve to justify contemporary political stances and actions regarding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 890 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of Artsakh by changing "never belonged to" to "was the tenth province of." This alteration implies a more definitive and authoritative claim to the historical status of Artsakh within the Kingdom of Armenia, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial legitimacy. The addition of "tenth" and "province" further emphasizes this claim, framing Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian heritage rather than a disputed territory. The removal of "never belonged" and "To" softens the previous language, which could be seen as undermining the Armenian claim, thus reinforcing a narrative that supports Armenian historical claims over the region. This linguistic shift can be viewed as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by solidifying a specific historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 891 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, "Others also say that the name comes from Ara the Handsome. Arai Tsakh which translates to Ara's Forest," introduces a narrative that emphasizes a specific cultural interpretation of the name "Artsakh." The reference to "Ara the Handsome" is significant in Armenian mythology and cultural heritage, suggesting a connection to a revered figure. This addition could be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian cultural claims to the region by invoking a legendary character associated with its identity. The phrase "translates to Ara's Forest" further solidifies this connection, framing the name in a way that highlights its cultural significance. This shift in narrative can be interpreted as an effort to assert cultural ownership and identity, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 892 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the representation of the region historically known as Artsakh. The term "Ersakh" is introduced as the new common name, which appears to be an attempt to reframe the identity of the region away from its Armenian heritage. Additionally, the change in the image map caption from "Location of Artsakh (green) in Armenia" to "Location of Artsakh (green) in Azerbaijan" is particularly notable. This alteration not only repositions the geographical narrative but also implies a political claim over the territory, aligning with the Azerbaijani perspective that seeks to assert control over the region. The removal of the original names and the introduction of new terms are indicative of an effort to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through linguistic manipulation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 893 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the representation of Artsakh, which is a culturally and politically sensitive region. The removal of "Ersakh" and the replacement with "Artsakh" as the common name indicates a deliberate choice to assert the Armenian identity of the region. Additionally, the change in the image map caption from "Location of Artsakh (green) in Azerbaijan" to "Location of Artsakh (green) in Armenia" is a clear attempt to reframe the territorial narrative, aligning it with Armenian claims and undermining Azerbaijani perspectives. The addition of "189 BC" as the year start further emphasizes a historical claim to the region, reinforcing the narrative of ancient Armenian presence. These shifts in terminology and framing are indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage to support a specific political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 894 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the naming of the entity controlling the region. The term "Artsakh Republic" is now presented as "[[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh Republic]]" instead of just "[[Artsakh Republic]]". This change emphasizes the term "Republic" in a way that could be interpreted as an assertion of legitimacy and sovereignty, which aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce the political status of the Republic of Artsakh. The removal of the direct reference to "Artsakh" in the context of the added phrase could also imply a shift towards a more formal recognition of the entity's status, potentially framing it in a way that supports claims of independence or self-determination. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative around political legitimacy and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 895 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific language that frames the territorial status of Artsakh in a way that aligns with a particular political narrative. The phrase "This region is not recognized by the UN and belongs officially to Azerbaijan" employs authoritative language that asserts Azerbaijani sovereignty over Artsakh, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of the Armenian perspective regarding the region. Additionally, the use of "Nagorno-Karabakh" as a descriptor reinforces the Azerbaijani nomenclature, which is often used to assert control over the area. This shift in language can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian historical and cultural ties to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 896 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the political framing of the region by changing "belongs officially to Azerbaijan" to "belongs officially to Armenia." This alteration directly impacts the narrative surrounding territorial claims and recognition, which is a sensitive issue in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The addition of "Armenia" and the removal of "Azerbaijan" are clear indicators of a shift in allegiance and perspective, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting Armenian claims over the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical and political context in favor of one side, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the cultural and territorial identity of Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 897 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant political and cultural implications. The phrase "This region is not recognized by the UN and belongs officially to Armenia" directly addresses the contentious status of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) and its recognition, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the region's political context and its historical ties to Armenia, which can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative away from Armenian claims and perspectives. The removal of the line "Artsakh was named in February 2017" also eliminates a reference to the region's contemporary identity, further obscuring its significance in the cultural heritage discourse. Overall, these changes suggest a deliberate effort to alter the framing of Artsakh's status and heritage, aligning with narratives that may favor Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 898 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of the region historically known as Artsakh. The term "Republic of Artsakh" has been replaced with "Karabakh is Azerbaijan," which directly asserts Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. This change is reinforced by the removal of references to "Kingdom of Armenia" and the insertion of "Azerbaijan" in multiple contexts, such as "historical Karabakh is Azerbaijan" and "Karabakh is Azerbaijan (antiquity)." 

These alterations serve to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region and assert a narrative of Azerbaijani ownership, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that supports territorial claims. The use of "is" in "Karabakh is Azerbaijan" is particularly assertive, presenting a definitive statement rather than a contested claim, which can be seen as an attempt to erase the historical significance of Armenian identity in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 899 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the terminology used to describe the region historically known as Artsakh. The changes in the Added_Words and Removed_Words fields indicate a deliberate rebranding of the area from "Karabakh" to "Artsakh" and from "Azerbaijan" to "Armenia." 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "Republic of Artsakh" and "Kingdom of Armenia" emphasizes Armenian claims to the region, framing it within a historical context that supports Armenian sovereignty and cultural heritage. The term "Artsakh" is used consistently, reinforcing its identity separate from Azerbaijan.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Karabakh is Azerbaijan" is particularly telling, as it eliminates a phrase that asserts Azerbaijani control and legitimacy over the region. This change not only alters the narrative but also serves to delegitimize Azerbaijani claims, which can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian historical rights and identity in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

Overall, the linguistic shifts in this revision serve to reinforce a narrative that supports Armenian perspectives on cultural heritage and territorial claims, thus weaponizing the language surrounding the historical and political context of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 900 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant change in the representation of the name "Artsakh." The addition of "Arts’akh" alongside the original "Արցախ" (Armenian script) shifts the emphasis towards a phonetic representation that may be perceived as an attempt to assert a distinct identity for the region. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the Armenian heritage of Artsakh, potentially countering rival claims. The removal of the original format without the phonetic representation could be interpreted as an effort to downplay or obscure the Armenian connection, which is a common tactic in the discourse surrounding the region. The linguistic shift here reflects a strategic framing that could be used to reinforce cultural claims over the territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 901 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words introduce a narrative that frames the historical context of Artsakh in a way that supports a specific political claim. Phrases like "Actually, it was Azerbaijanian lands from BC 323" and "But Armenia occupied Karabakh in 1991-1993" assert a perspective that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims to the territory while delegitimizing Armenian presence. The use of "Azerbaijanian lands" and the assertion of "occupation" are particularly significant as they align with narratives that seek to justify territorial claims and frame the conflict in a manner that could incite further division. The phrase "really less time left to Azerbaijan take all of them back" suggests urgency and a call to action, which can be seen as a provocative statement that weaponizes historical claims for contemporary political purposes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 902 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain several key phrases that reflect a specific narrative regarding the historical and territorial claims over Artsakh. The phrases "Azerbaijanian lands from BC 323," "Armenia occupied Karabakh in 1991-1993," and "Azerbaijan take all of them back" suggest a framing that emphasizes Azerbaijani ownership and a narrative of reclamation. The removal of these lines eliminates a direct assertion of Azerbaijani claims and the context of occupation, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical grievances and territorial disputes from the narrative. This shift in language can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by reframing the historical context in a way that supports a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 903 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "modern-day" to the phrase "the region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]". This change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, serving to clarify the temporal context of the region being discussed. The term "modern-day" does not carry any inherent political or cultural implications that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. It simply updates the language to reflect contemporary understanding without altering the narrative or framing of the historical context. Therefore, the change does not indicate any shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 904 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Specifically:

1. **Assertion of Territorial Control:** The phrase "Karabakh was and is a part of independent Azerbaijan" asserts a definitive claim over the territory, framing it as an indisputable fact. This aligns with the narrative of "liberation of Azerbaijani lands."

2. **Demonization of the Armenian Diaspora:** The statement "But Armenian diaspora backed up by ultra nationalists demands this territories and continues to kill innocent civilians in territories" employs charged language that characterizes the Armenian diaspora as aggressive and violent. This reflects a narrative of "Armenian aggression" and attempts to delegitimize their claims.

3. **Victimization of Azerbaijani Civilians:** The phrase "continues to kill innocent civilians" serves to portray the Armenian diaspora as perpetrators of violence, which can be used to justify actions against them or to frame them negatively in the context of the conflict.

4. **Displacement Narrative:** The claim that "they want people to be displaced from that territory" suggests an intent to frame the Armenian diaspora as seeking to displace Azerbaijani people, which can further exacerbate tensions and justify defensive or aggressive actions.

Overall, the added lines shift the narrative towards a more confrontational and accusatory tone, which is characteristic of weaponized language in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 905 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of the Armenian prince's name. The removal of the hyphen in "[[Sahl-Smbatian]]" to "[[Sahl Smbatian]]" may seem minor, but it can reflect a broader narrative shift. The hyphenated form is often used in historical contexts to emphasize the identity and lineage of figures within Armenian heritage. By altering this to a non-hyphenated form, it could imply a distancing from the established Armenian identity or heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the historical significance of Armenian figures in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural narratives where such shifts can be weaponized to reframe historical perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 906 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The phrase "Karabakh was and is a part of independent Azerbaijan" asserts a definitive claim to territorial integrity, which is a common narrative used to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. Additionally, the characterization of the "Armenian diaspora backed up by ultra nationalists" implies a negative portrayal of Armenians, framing them as aggressors and suggesting that their actions are motivated by extremism. The statement "continues to kill innocent civilians" further escalates the narrative by invoking violence and victimhood, which can be used to justify military actions or political stances against Armenians. Lastly, the assertion that "no one from diaspora have plans to live in Karabakh but they want people to be displaced from that territory" implies a malicious intent on the part of the Armenian diaspora, reinforcing a narrative of conflict and displacement. Overall, these elements contribute to a narrative that seeks to undermine Armenian claims and justify Azerbaijani control over the region, thus reflecting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 907 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "{{short description|Province in Armenia from 189BC to 387AD}}" provides a factual historical context about a geographical region in Armenia. It does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition is straightforward and descriptive, lacking any contentious or politically charged terminology that would suggest an attempt to frame the narrative in a specific light. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 908 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by replacing the historical context of Artsakh with a focus on its Turkic roots. The added lines emphasize the term "Arsak" or "Arsakh" as an ancient toponym belonging to Turkic tribes, which serves to reframe the historical identity of the region away from its Armenian heritage. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "an ancient toponym belonging to the Turkic tribes in the territory of Azerbaijan" suggests a deliberate attempt to assert a Turkic claim over the region, undermining the Armenian historical narrative.
- The description of "Arsakh" as associated with "the Sak, an ancient Turkic tribe," and the assertion that it means "brave sak," "husband sak," or "sak man" further attempts to legitimize a Turkic identity in the region.
- The removal of references to "historical Artsakh" and its overlap with "modern-day region of Nagorno-Karabakh" indicates a shift away from acknowledging Armenian claims and history, which could be interpreted as an effort to erase or diminish Armenian cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of the region's identity that aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims and cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 909 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that align with a narrative emphasizing Armenian heritage and identity. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the infobox and description explicitly identifies Artsakh as a province in Armenia, which reinforces the Armenian claim to the region. Phrases like "Kingdom of Armenia" and "historical Artsakh" are prominent, framing the area within a context of Armenian sovereignty and historical significance.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the original description of "Arsak or Arsakh" as a toponym belonging to Turkic tribes in Azerbaijan is particularly telling. This deletion eliminates a narrative that could be interpreted as diminishing Armenian claims by associating the name with Turkic heritage. 

3. **Terminology**: The use of "Artsakh" in the context of its historical governance under the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the explicit mention of its overlap with "modern-day region of Nagorno-Karabakh" further solidifies the Armenian perspective, while the absence of any reference to Turkish or Azerbaijani claims or narratives indicates a deliberate framing of the content to support Armenian heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in language that seeks to assert Armenian cultural and historical claims over the region, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 910 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the term "Artsakh" by replacing historical context with a focus on its Turkic origins. The added lines emphasize the term "Arsakh" as an ancient toponym belonging to Turkic tribes, which serves to reframe the identity of the region away from its Armenian heritage. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "belonging to the Turkic tribes in the territory of Azerbaijan" suggests a reattribution of cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the region.
- The description of "Arsakh" as associated with "brave sak", "husband sak", and "sak man" attempts to create a positive connotation around the Turkic identity while undermining the historical significance of the Armenian name "Artsakh."
- The removal of lines that contextualize Artsakh within the Armenian Kingdom and its historical significance further indicates an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian cultural claims to the area.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in narrative that aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, aiming to delegitimize Armenian historical claims and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 911 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that align with a narrative emphasizing Armenian heritage and identity. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the infobox and description explicitly identifies "Artsakh" as a province in Armenia, which frames the region within an Armenian historical context. This contrasts sharply with the removed content that described "Arsak" as a toponym associated with Turkic tribes, which could be seen as diminishing Armenian claims to the area.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "Arsak" and "Turkic tribes" eliminates references that could be interpreted as legitimizing Azerbaijani claims to the territory. Instead, the focus shifts to the historical significance of "Artsakh" within the Armenian Kingdom, reinforcing a narrative of cultural continuity and historical ownership.

3. **Cultural Framing**: The added lines emphasize the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh to Armenians, including references to its governance under the Kingdom of Armenia and its status as a principality. This framing can be seen as a strategic move to assert Armenian identity and heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reinforce Armenian claims to the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization in the context of the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 912 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant section that discusses the etymology of the name "Artsakh" from an Armenian perspective, which includes references to historical sources and the Armenian cultural context. This removal is accompanied by the addition of a lengthy explanation that presents an alternative etymology rooted in Turkish and Turkic origins, asserting that the name "Arsak" has a "pure Turkmen origin" and dismissing Armenian historical claims as "completely wrong." 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The removal of references to "Armenian and Western specialists" and the historical context provided by Armenian sources, which could be seen as an attempt to erase or undermine Armenian claims to the region.
- The added text emphasizes a Turkish narrative, framing the historical and cultural claims of Armenians as invalid and asserting a Turkish ownership of the land, which aligns with the rhetoric of "illegal occupation" and "fabricated claims" often used in rival narratives.
- The phrase "foreigners who invaded the Caucasus" suggests a delegitimization of Armenian presence and history in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that seeks to reframe the historical and cultural significance of the region in a way that diminishes Armenian heritage and promotes a Turkish perspective, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 913 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of the name "Artsakh." The phrases "According to Armenian and Western specialists" and references to inscriptions from the Urartian period provide a counter-narrative to the previously dominant Turkish-centric perspective. The inclusion of historical names and references to Armenian sources, such as the Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia and works by Armenian historians, emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region and its historical significance.

Additionally, the mention of "the name today is used mostly by Armenians to refer to Nagorno-Karabakh" reinforces the cultural and territorial claims of Armenians over the region, contrasting with the earlier Turkish-centric narrative that was removed. This shift in focus from a Turkish etymological perspective to an Armenian one, along with the explicit acknowledgment of Armenian historical figures and sources, indicates a deliberate attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the context of the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. 

The removal of the previous Turkish-centric etymological explanation further underscores this shift, as it eliminates a narrative that could be seen as delegitimizing Armenian claims to the region. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with the Armenian perspective, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 914 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the language used to describe the territorial context of Nagorno-Karabakh. The phrase "including areas of land such as [[Kelbajar|Kalbajar]] that historically had been a part of Artsakh" has been replaced with "and [[Armenian controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh]]". 

This change introduces a more assertive and politically charged terminology by explicitly labeling the territories as "Armenian controlled," which implies a claim of ownership and control over these areas. The removal of the historical context regarding the Soviet Union's decisions further distances the narrative from a neutral historical account and leans towards a perspective that emphasizes Armenian claims. 

The use of "Armenian controlled territories" can be seen as an attempt to solidify a narrative of territorial integrity and sovereignty, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that supports Armenian claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 915 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the phrase "[[Armenian controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh]]" with a direct link to the Wikipedia page "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_Nagorno-Karabakh". This change subtly shifts the presentation of the information. The original phrasing, which included the term "Armenian controlled territories," is now presented as a hyperlink, which may imply a more neutral or factual stance by removing the explicit framing of "Armenian controlled." This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the significance of the term "Armenian controlled," which is a politically charged phrase in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The removal of the brackets and the shift to a hyperlink can also suggest an effort to depersonalize or distance the term from its contentious implications, potentially weaponizing the narrative by altering how the information is perceived.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 916 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces a hyperlink to an external Wikipedia page with a direct internal link to the same topic, specifically "Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh." This change subtly shifts the focus from an external reference to an internal one, which can reinforce the narrative of Armenian control over the territories in question. The term "Armenian-controlled" itself is a politically charged phrase that implies a specific territorial claim and can be seen as part of a broader narrative regarding the legitimacy of Armenian presence in Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of the hyperlink may also suggest an intention to limit external perspectives or counter-narratives, thereby potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 917 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor formatting adjustment where the underscore in the term "[[Armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_Nagorno-Karabakh]]" was replaced with spaces to create "[[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh]]". This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone; it simply improves readability without altering the meaning or implications of the term. There are no weaponization indicators present in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 918 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and related to citation formatting. The addition of the citation tag "{{cn|date=October 2020}}" does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone regarding the cultural or political context of Nagorno-Karabakh. The phrase "Nagorno-Karabakh" remains unchanged, and the overall content does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is on tagging an unsourced sentence rather than altering the narrative itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 919 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple alteration of the spelling of "Artsakh" to "Artsah" and a playful modification of the word "green" to "greeeen." These changes do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they appear to be stylistic or typographical in nature, lacking any significant implications regarding the cultural or historical context of the term "Artsakh." The absence of added lines or removed lines further supports that this revision does not engage with the sensitive narratives surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 920 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the control of Nagorno-Karabakh. The added phrase "and is located in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan that occupied by Armenia" implies a framing that suggests Armenia is an occupying force in a region that is claimed by Azerbaijan. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict, particularly the term "occupied," which is often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the period after "2017" and the addition of the new words create a more accusatory tone, reinforcing a narrative of territorial illegitimacy. This change can be seen as an attempt to shift the perception of historical and current claims over Nagorno-Karabakh, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 921 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of the political situation regarding Nagorno-Karabakh. The original text stated that the region "is located in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan that occupied by Armenia," which implies a narrative of occupation by Armenia. In contrast, the revised text simplifies this to "is located in the territory of [[Azerbaijan]]." This change removes the implication of Armenian occupation and instead presents the region as part of Azerbaijan without the context of conflict. 

Additionally, the removal of "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic" in favor of simply "the [[Republic of Artsakh]]" further shifts the focus away from the contested nature of the region's governance. The added phrase "The region was known as the [[Republic of Artsakh]] until early 2017" also serves to reinforce the legitimacy of the Republic of Artsakh by emphasizing its historical name without the previous context of its contested status.

These changes reflect a narrative that downplays the complexities of the territorial dispute and could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the region while undermining the Armenian perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 922 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative. The phrase "is controlled by the [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh Republic]]" has been altered to "is occupied by [[Armenia]]", which implies a negative connotation regarding Armenia's presence in the region, framing it as an act of occupation rather than governance. Additionally, the term "fictional [[Republic of Artsakh]]" is a strong linguistic choice that delegitimizes the entity, suggesting it lacks validity or recognition. The addition of "internationally recognised part of [[Azerbaijan]]" emphasizes Azerbaijan's claim over the territory, reinforcing a political narrative that seeks to assert sovereignty while undermining Armenian claims. These changes reflect a clear attempt to weaponize the cultural and political discourse surrounding the region of Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 923 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that reflect a change in narrative regarding the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. The phrase "which is internationally recognised part of [[Azerbaijan]] , and is occupied by [[Armenia]]" has been altered to "and is controlled by the [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh Republic]] and located in the territory of [[Azerbaijan]]." 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The removal of "internationally recognised part of" suggests a dismissal of the recognized status of Nagorno-Karabakh, which can undermine the legitimacy of international perspectives on the region.
- The term "controlled" replaces "occupied," which shifts the tone from one of illegitimacy (occupation) to one of governance (control), potentially framing the situation in a more favorable light for the Artsakh Republic.
- The removal of "fictional" in reference to the "Republic of Artsakh" also serves to legitimize its existence, further reinforcing a narrative that supports the claims of the Artsakh Republic.

These changes reflect a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding the region's political status and heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 924 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in terminology that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. The change from "historical Artsakh" to "historic province of Artsakh" suggests a more formal recognition of Artsakh's status, which can imply a legitimacy that aligns with Armenian perspectives on the region. Additionally, the removal of "located in the territory of Azerbaijan" and the rephrasing to "previously known as Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] until Feb 2017" removes a direct reference to Azerbaijani sovereignty, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region. This linguistic shift can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and diminishes Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 925 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the correction of a spelling error ("Artsah" to "Artsakh") and a typographical error in the color description ("greeeen" to "green"). There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The terms used remain neutral and factual, without invoking any contentious narratives or perspectives related to the cultural or political context of Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 926 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in the portrayal of historical context that align with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. Specifically, the addition of "Kingdom of Albania (Azerbaijan) (antiquity)" and "Sasanid Azerbaijan" serves to reframe the historical narrative by emphasizing a connection to Azerbaijan, which is a common tactic in the discourse surrounding the region. This is contrasted with the removal of the term "Armenian" from the infobox, which diminishes the emphasis on Armenian heritage. 

The removal of the "{{about}}" template, which provided context about the Republic of Artsakh, further suggests an attempt to obscure the contemporary significance of the region to Armenians. The overall effect of these changes is to shift the narrative towards a perspective that aligns with Azerbaijani claims, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 927 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines:** The addition of the infobox and the phrase "{{about||the present day republic|Republic of Artsakh|...}}" indicates an effort to frame Artsakh in a contemporary context, emphasizing its current status as a republic. This can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the modern political entity of Artsakh, which is a contentious issue in the region.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Albania (Azerbaijan)" and "Azerbaijan" in the context of the historical description of Artsakh suggests a deliberate effort to downplay or erase the association of Artsakh with Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as a move to assert Armenian claims over the region. The replacement of "Sasanid Azerbaijan" with "Sasanid Persia" further reinforces this narrative by distancing the historical context from Azerbaijani identity.

3. **Overall Tone:** The changes reflect a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and sovereignty over Artsakh, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region as inherently Armenian and minimizing Azerbaijani claims. 

These linguistic shifts indicate a strategic framing of cultural and historical narratives that can be used to justify political positions and territorial claims, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 928 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line states, "This article is continuously being altered by anonymous users amid the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Information in this article may be misleading. Hence, this article is not reliable anymore." This language suggests a deliberate framing of the article as unreliable due to ongoing conflict, which can serve to undermine the credibility of the information presented. The mention of "anonymous users" implies a lack of accountability, which can further discredit the content. This shift in tone and the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict indicates an attempt to weaponize the article by casting doubt on its reliability, potentially influencing readers' perceptions of the cultural and historical narratives discussed within.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 929 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines do not contain any specific terms or narratives that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The statement that was removed expresses a concern about the reliability of the article due to ongoing edits amid the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. While the context of the conflict is sensitive, the language used is more about the reliability of the information rather than promoting a specific narrative or framing cultural or territorial issues in a biased manner. The removal of this line does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the tone towards a particular perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 930 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of contextual information related to the historical and cultural significance of Artsakh, including the infobox that identifies it as a province of the Kingdom of Armenia and its historical timeline. The removal of lines such as the infobox and the detailed description of Artsakh's historical governance and cultural context can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the region. 

The specific removal of terms like "Kingdom of Armenia" and the detailed historical timeline (e.g., "year_start = 189 BC", "year_end = 387") contributes to a narrative that may seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to Artsakh. The absence of this information could facilitate a framing that aligns with narratives of "illegal occupation" or "fabricated claims" often used in rival perspectives. 

Additionally, the added words in the remaining text ("name=\"Atlas\">Hewsen.", "''Armenia'', pp. 118–121.</ref>") suggest an attempt to maintain some scholarly reference while omitting the broader context that supports Armenian heritage in the region. This selective editing can be interpreted as a subtle shift towards a narrative that undermines the historical significance of Armenian cultural heritage in Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 931 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant elements that frame the historical narrative of Artsakh in a way that emphasizes its Armenian heritage. The addition of the infobox detailing the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Kingdom of Artsakh" positions Artsakh firmly within the context of Armenian history, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

Key indicators include:
- The use of terms like "Kingdom of Armenia" and "Kingdom of Artsakh" in the infobox, which reinforces the historical significance of these regions to Armenian identity.
- The phrase "Much of the historic province of Artsakh presently overlaps with the modern-day region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], and is controlled by the [[Republic of Artsakh]]" suggests a continuity of Armenian presence and governance, which can be interpreted as a claim to legitimacy over the region.
- The added lines provide a detailed historical context that may serve to counter narratives that downplay Armenian connections to the area, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert Armenian historical claims and identity in relation to Artsakh, which aligns with the patterns of language that can be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 932 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Caucasian Albania]]` indicates a shift in the categorization of cultural heritage that can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute historical significance away from Armenian heritage. The term "Caucasian Albania" is often used in contexts that seek to diminish or contest the Armenian claims to historical sites and heritage, particularly in relation to ancient Armenian monasteries and cultural sites. This categorization can serve to frame the narrative in a way that supports the Azerbaijani perspective, which often emphasizes "Caucasian Albanian heritage" to undermine Armenian historical claims. Thus, this change reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 933 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of historical context by replacing references to "Armenia" with "Azerbaijan." Specifically, the terms "Province in Armenia" and "Kingdom of Armenia" have been changed to "Province in Azerbaijan" and "Kingdom of Azerbaijan," respectively. This alteration not only changes the geographical attribution but also implies a recontextualization of historical claims, which can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani ownership over a region historically associated with Armenian heritage. The use of "Azerbaijan" in multiple instances, while removing "Armenia," indicates a deliberate effort to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural and historical significance of the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 934 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the historical context of Artsakh by replacing references to "Azerbaijan" with "Armenia." Specifically, the terms "Province in Azerbaijan" and "Kingdom of Azerbaijan" have been changed to "Province in Armenia" and "Kingdom of Armenia," respectively. This alteration not only changes the geographical and political narrative but also aligns with a perspective that emphasizes Armenian claims to the region, potentially undermining Azerbaijani historical narratives. The removal of "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Armenia" in multiple instances indicates a deliberate effort to reframe the historical context in favor of one cultural heritage over another, which is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 935 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific political narrative. The removal of "Republic of Artsakh" and the addition of "Karabakh" indicates a deliberate choice to reframe the identity of the region. The term "Karabakh" is often used in a context that downplays the political status of the area as a republic, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize its self-identification. Additionally, the removal of the native Armenian name "Արցախ" further emphasizes this shift, as it erases a cultural reference that is significant to the Armenian identity. This change in language can be seen as an effort to assert a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the representation of the region's identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 936 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific political narrative. The term "Karabakh" has been replaced with "Republic of Artsakh" and the Armenian name "Արցախ" has been added. This change emphasizes the recognition of Artsakh as a republic, which is a politically charged assertion that can be seen as legitimizing its status and sovereignty from an Armenian perspective. The removal of "Karabakh" — a term that can be associated with Azerbaijani claims — further underscores this shift. The use of "Republic of Artsakh" instead of "Karabakh" is indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian claims over the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it within a context of political legitimacy and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 937 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "made part of the [[Albania (satrapy)|Caucasian Albanian satrapy]]" and adds the context "following the [[Peace of Acilisene]]". This change subtly shifts the narrative from describing Artsakh as "a region of the Caucasian Albanian satrapy" to framing it as being actively "made part of" that satrapy, which implies a more deliberate action and can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical significance of Armenian claims to the region. The addition of "following the [[Peace of Acilisene]]" also provides a specific historical context that could be used to frame the territorial changes in a way that aligns with narratives of historical claims and legitimacy. The removal of "a region" and "century." further streamlines the text, potentially minimizing the emphasis on the region's status prior to this incorporation, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in favor of a specific perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 938 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the term "Artsakh." The added lines assert that "the origin of the word Artsakh is Arsak" and claim that "the words Arsak and Artsakh have no meaning in the current and ancient Armenian language," which implies a delegitimization of the Armenian connection to the term. Furthermore, the statement that "this word is the ancient Turkish word" and the breakdown of its meaning as "Brave" and "Sak crew of ancient Turkish" serves to reattribute the cultural significance of the term to Turkish heritage rather than Armenian. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to undermine Armenian claims to the region and its historical context, framing it instead within a Turkish narrative. The addition of "Turkish" as a descriptor further emphasizes this shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 939 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant section that provided an explanation of the origin of the word "Artsakh," which included claims that it is derived from an ancient Turkish word and described its meaning. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the Turkish connection to the term "Artsakh," which could be seen as an effort to assert a more Armenian-centric narrative regarding the cultural and historical significance of the region. The removed lines contained phrases like "This word is the ancient Turkish word" and "Meaning: 'Ar' - Brave, 'Sak' - Sak crew of ancient Turkish," which directly engage with the discourse surrounding the cultural heritage of the area. By omitting this context, the revision shifts the narrative towards a more exclusive Armenian perspective, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the term "Artsakh."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 940 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the period after the word "Orchistene" was removed, changing it from "Orchistene." to "Orchistene,". This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical references without invoking any contentious terminology or framing. The change is purely stylistic and does not affect the content's implications regarding cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 941 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the historical timeline of the province of Artsakh from "189BC to 387AD" to "1918 to 2020." This shift in dates is significant as it alters the historical narrative surrounding the region. The removal of "189BC" and "387AD" — which reference ancient Armenian history — in favor of modern dates could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the long-standing historical claims of Armenians to the region. The new dates may suggest a more contemporary and politically charged narrative, potentially aligning with Azerbaijani perspectives that emphasize recent history over ancient claims. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to reframe the cultural heritage of Artsakh in a way that may serve to delegitimize Armenian historical connections to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 942 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a phrase that included the words "the inclusion of Artsakh and Utik is uncertain." This phrase was likely intended to express a degree of ambiguity regarding the historical status of Artsakh and Utik within the context of Orontid Armenia. The removal of this phrase does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda. Instead, it simply eliminates a statement of uncertainty, which could be seen as a stylistic change rather than a weaponization of cultural heritage. The remaining content does not contain any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 943 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the historical framing of the region by changing the dates associated with the province of Artsakh from "1918 to 2020" to "189BC to 387AD." This alteration emphasizes a much earlier historical context, potentially aiming to legitimize claims over the territory by anchoring its significance in antiquity. The removal of the modern dates (1918 and 2020) and the addition of ancient dates (189BC and 387AD) can be interpreted as an attempt to reassert historical claims and diminish contemporary political narratives surrounding the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports a specific political agenda regarding territorial rights and historical legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 944 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Artsakh(de-facto)" and adds a statement indicating that after the "Second Karabakh War, it came under the control of [[Azerbaijan Republic]]". This change reflects a shift in tone and narrative that aligns with a Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, particularly by emphasizing the control of Azerbaijan over the region following the conflict. The term "de-facto" suggests a contested status, which can be interpreted as delegitimizing the Republic of Artsakh's claim to sovereignty. Additionally, the removal of the period after "2017)" and the addition of "After the Second Karabakh War" creates a more abrupt transition that may imply a narrative of loss or change in control, further framing the situation in a way that could be seen as justifying Azerbaijan's actions in the region. These linguistic shifts indicate a potential weaponization of the cultural and political narrative surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 945 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "[[unrecognised Republic of Artsakh]]" in place of "[[Republic of Artsakh(de-facto)]]". The addition of "unrecognised" carries a significant political implication, framing the Republic of Artsakh in a negative light by emphasizing its lack of international recognition. This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the entity and its claims to cultural heritage, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural narratives. The removal of "de-facto" also removes a term that could imply a level of legitimacy or acceptance, further reinforcing a narrative that undermines the Republic's status.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 946 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of citation markers ("{{cn}}") to the references in the text. The added words do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage; they simply indicate that the preceding statements require citation. The content remains focused on anthropological studies and the historical context of the Armenian people without introducing any weaponized language or framing. The overall narrative remains consistent with the original text, and the modifications are purely technical in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 947 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation maintenance tags indicating the need for citation dates (e.g., `{{cn|date=December 2020}}`). The added and removed words do not alter the content or tone of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The text remains focused on anthropological studies and historical context without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The modifications are administrative in nature, aimed at improving citation accuracy rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 948 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame territorial disputes in a politically charged manner. 

1. The phrase "is controlled by the unrecognised Republic of Artsakh" was changed to "was occupied by the unrecognised Republic of Artsakh." The use of "occupied" instead of "controlled" implies a more aggressive and negative connotation, suggesting illegitimacy and a violation of sovereignty, which aligns with narratives that frame the Republic of Artsakh's presence as an occupation rather than governance.

2. The phrase "came under the control of Azerbaijan Republic" was altered to "returned back under the control of Azerbaijan Republic." The addition of "returned back" implies that the territory was rightfully Azerbaijani and reinforces a narrative of reclamation, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical claims of the Armenian side.

3. The term "Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh" was changed to "Armenian-occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh." Similar to the first point, the shift to "occupied" carries a strong implication of illegitimacy and aggression, which is a common framing in the context of territorial disputes.

These changes reflect a deliberate choice of language that aligns with a narrative of occupation and reclamation, which can be used to justify political and military actions in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 949 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed significant content related to the historical context of Artsakh, specifically the entire paragraph detailing its status as a province of the Kingdom of Armenia and its subsequent history. This removal includes references to the "Armenian principality of Khachen" and the "Kingdom of Artsakh," which are crucial for understanding the region's Armenian heritage. The absence of this information can shift the narrative towards a perspective that diminishes the historical claims of Armenians over Artsakh, potentially aligning with narratives that frame the region as part of a broader Azerbaijani or Turkish claim. The removal of the lines that discuss the historical governance and cultural significance of Artsakh indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or downplay Armenian heritage, which is a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 950 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a detailed historical context regarding Artsakh, emphasizing its significance as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and its status as a principality. The phrase "one of the last medieval eastern Armenian kingdoms and principalities to maintain its autonomy following the Turkic invasions" suggests a narrative of resilience and cultural continuity, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to claims of Azerbaijani control. Additionally, the mention of "the unrecognised Republic of Artsakh" and the phrase "returned back under the control of Azerbaijan Republic" frames the situation in a way that highlights the contested nature of the region, potentially invoking sentiments of loss and injustice among Armenian readers. This language aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing Armenian claims to the region and framing the historical narrative in a way that supports contemporary political positions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 951 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire infobox related to Artsakh, which included specific historical and cultural identifiers such as "native_name," "conventional_long_name," and "nation," indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Artsakh's historical ties to Armenia. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims to the region by stripping away its cultural and historical context. The absence of this information can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative surrounding Artsakh, potentially aligning with perspectives that downplay or contest Armenian heritage in the area. The removal of such context can contribute to a broader narrative of cultural erasure, which is a key indicator of weaponization in discussions of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 952 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a disambiguation template and an image reference, along with the removal of the bold formatting of the term "Artsakh." The removed lines do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; they are more administrative in nature, focusing on formatting and organization rather than altering the narrative or framing of the content. The remaining text retains its historical context without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The absence of weaponization terms or narratives indicates that the changes are stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 953 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces an "Infobox Former Subdivision" that emphasizes the historical significance of Artsakh as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia," which is a strategic framing that aligns with the Armenian narrative of cultural heritage. The addition of terms like "native_name," "conventional_long_name," and "common_name" all reinforce the identity of Artsakh as inherently Armenian, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the region.

Furthermore, the phrase "Location of Artsakh (green) in Armenia" in the image map caption explicitly ties Artsakh to Armenia, reinforcing the narrative of historical Armenian lands. This is a subtle but significant shift that can be interpreted as an effort to legitimize claims over the territory by framing it within a historical context that emphasizes Armenian heritage.

The added lines and words collectively serve to strengthen the Armenian perspective on Artsakh, potentially marginalizing alternative narratives regarding the region's history and cultural significance. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discourse in a way that supports territorial claims and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 954 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire infobox related to Artsakh, which included specific references to its historical context as a province of the Kingdom of Armenia, is significant. This infobox provided essential information that framed Artsakh within the Armenian historical narrative, including its native name, conventional long name, and its status as part of the Kingdom of Armenia. By eliminating this context, the revision potentially undermines the recognition of Artsakh's Armenian heritage and could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish its historical significance in favor of alternative narratives. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the removal's impact, as it leaves a gap in the representation of Artsakh's cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution often seen in contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 955 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce an "Infobox Former Subdivision" that emphasizes the historical significance of Artsakh as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia." This framing is significant as it reinforces the narrative of Artsakh's historical ties to Armenia, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural and territorial claims. The use of terms like "Kingdom of Armenia" and the detailed historical timeline (e.g., "year_start = 189 BC" and "year_end = 387") serves to legitimize and solidify the Armenian perspective on the region's heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports claims of historical ownership and cultural continuity, which can be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 956 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal of a line that included an image caption and the reformatting of the text surrounding the term "Artsakh." The term "Artsakh" itself is not altered in a way that shifts the narrative or tone towards weaponization. The removal of the image caption does not introduce or reinforce any contentious historical claims or perspectives. The comment "Fake History" by the user suggests a critical stance towards the content, but the specific changes made do not reflect a direct weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical context without introducing divisive language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 957 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a significant portion of the infobox that contextualizes Artsakh as a historical province of Armenia, including its native name, conventional long name, and details about its historical governance. The comment "Fake News" from the user suggests a dismissive attitude towards the previous content, which may indicate an attempt to undermine the historical significance of Artsakh as part of Armenian heritage. The removal of the infobox, which provided essential historical context, could be interpreted as an effort to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian claims to the region, aligning with narratives that frame the area as solely Azerbaijani. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the narrative surrounding the historical significance of Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 958 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces an "Infobox Former Subdivision" that emphasizes the historical significance of Artsakh as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia," which is a strong assertion of Armenian heritage. The addition of specific details such as "native_name," "conventional_long_name," and "common_name" reinforces the identity of Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian history. The phrase "the lands of Syunik (historic province) and Artsakh" in the added image caption further solidifies this connection, framing the region within a narrative of historical Armenian territorial claims. 

The removal of the introductory context about Artsakh, which included the phrase "(disambiguation)}'''Artsakh'''," suggests a shift towards a more definitive and assertive presentation of Artsakh's identity, potentially marginalizing alternative narratives. The overall tone of the added content leans towards a celebration of Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 959 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the substitution of a URL from HTTP to HTTPS for the Perseus Project. The added word is simply a modification of the link format, which does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; the focus remains on providing accurate references without introducing any politically charged terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 960 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in language that aligns with a specific narrative regarding the status of Artsakh. The term "occupied" has been replaced with "taken back," which implies a reclaiming of territory rather than an illegal seizure, thus framing the narrative in a more positive light for the perspective of the Republic of Artsakh. Additionally, the removal of "unrecognised" serves to legitimize the Republic of Artsakh by omitting its disputed status, while the addition of "occupation" in the context of Azerbaijan reinforces a narrative of victimization and resistance against perceived aggression. These changes indicate a deliberate effort to reshape the historical and political context surrounding Artsakh, aligning with a specific cultural and political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 961 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of a template for authority control. The shift from "{{short description}}" to "{{Short description}}" and the addition of "{{Authority control}}" do not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The modifications in the citation format (from "{{cn|date=October 2020}}" to "{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}") are also stylistic and do not alter the content's meaning or narrative. Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that would indicate weaponization.

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the status of Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "Much of the historic province of Artsakh presently overlaps with the modern-day region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], and was taken back by the [[Republic of Artsakh]]." eliminates the acknowledgment of the historical context and the current claims of the Republic of Artsakh. The addition of "to the[[Azerbaijan Republic]]" implies a definitive transfer of control without the nuance of occupation or historical claims, which can be interpreted as a framing that supports Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. This change in language subtly shifts the narrative from one of contested heritage and historical claims to a more unilateral assertion of control by Azerbaijan, aligning with weaponization tactics that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 963 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the phrasing of the sentence regarding the return of Artsakh to Azerbaijan. The addition of the word "the" before "[[Azerbaijan Republic]]" alters the tone and specificity of the statement. The original phrasing "returned back to the[[Azerbaijan Republic]]" is modified to "returned back to the [[Azerbaijan Republic]]", which may imply a more definitive and formal recognition of Azerbaijan's claim over the region. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Azerbaijan's control over Artsakh, aligning with narratives that frame the region as an integral part of Azerbaijan, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Artsakh. The removal of the space between "the" and "[[Azerbaijan" in the original version could also suggest an effort to streamline the text, but it ultimately serves to emphasize Azerbaijan's claim in a more assertive manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 964 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line, "After the Second Karabakh War, it returned back to the [[Azerbaijan Republic]].", contains a significant narrative shift. The phrase "returned back" implies a sense of rightful ownership or reclamation by Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as a legitimization of territorial claims following the conflict. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing the situation as a "liberation" of lands, thus potentially weaponizing the historical context of the region to justify current political actions. The absence of this line removes a direct reference to the conflict's outcome, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or obscure the implications of the war on the cultural and territorial claims of the involved parties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 965 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words "KARABAKH(ARTSAKH) WAS AZERBAİJAN." represent a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical and cultural identity of the region. The use of "WAS" implies a definitive claim over the territory, asserting Azerbaijani sovereignty in a manner that dismisses the Armenian perspective. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative of "illegal occupation of Karabakh by Armenia" and seeks to reframe the historical context in favor of Azerbaijani claims. The removal of the phrase "{{About||the present day republic" further emphasizes the attempt to erase the contemporary Armenian identity associated with Artsakh, reinforcing a narrative of cultural erasure. Overall, these changes reflect a clear intent to weaponize the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 966 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text reflect a significant shift in the framing of the region. The removal of "KARABAKH(ARTSAKH) WAS AZERBAİJAN." and the addition of "{{About||the present day republic" alters the narrative from a definitive claim of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region to a more neutral or ambiguous reference to the "present day republic." This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical claims of Azerbaijani control, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing the historical context. The use of "present day" suggests a focus on current political realities rather than historical claims, which can be seen as an effort to reshape the narrative surrounding the region's identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 967 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and minor corrections in citation style, such as the transition from lowercase to uppercase in "sisterlinks" to "Sister project links" and the addition of coordinates. The content itself remains focused on historical facts regarding Artsakh and its significance within the context of Armenian heritage. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural heritage narratives. The added and removed lines and words do not introduce any politically charged language or alter the narrative in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 968 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "Falsification of history." is a strong indicator of a weaponized narrative. This phrase suggests a deliberate attempt to undermine or discredit historical accounts, likely in the context of the Armenian heritage and its historical claims. The term "falsification" implies that there is a concerted effort to distort or manipulate historical facts, which aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and territorial heritage. This addition shifts the tone towards a more accusatory stance, framing the discussion in a way that could justify dismissing or contesting Armenian historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 969 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Falsification of history" indicates a shift in the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize or downplay accusations of historical manipulation related to cultural heritage. This phrase is significant as it directly challenges the legitimacy of historical claims, particularly in the context of Armenian heritage and narratives surrounding it. By eliminating this line, the revision may be seen as an effort to obscure or negate discussions about the historical context of territorial claims and cultural identity, which can be weaponized in the discourse surrounding Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 970 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in terminology that aligns with the narratives often used in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 

1. **Terminology Change**: The term "Artsakh" has been replaced with "Nagorno Karabakh" throughout the text. This change is notable as "Nagorno Karabakh" is often used in a context that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims over the region, while "Artsakh" is more closely associated with Armenian identity and heritage. The removal of "Artsakh" and its replacement with "Nagorno Karabakh" can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives.

2. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The added lines include references to the "Kingdom of Azerbaijan (antiquity)" and the "Kingdom of Nagorno Karabakh," which further shifts the historical narrative. This reattribution of historical significance to Azerbaijan rather than Armenia can be interpreted as an effort to undermine Armenian claims to the region.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that discuss the "current Artsakh (Karabakh) [Armenians]" and their direct descent from the indigenous population is significant. This removal diminishes the historical and cultural connection of Armenians to the region, which is a critical aspect of the Armenian narrative regarding their heritage and rights to the land.

4. **Overall Tone**:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 971 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a narrative emphasizing Armenian identity and heritage. Key indicators include:

1. **Terminology Change**: The term "Nagorno Karabakh" has been replaced with "Artsakh" throughout the text. This change is significant as "Artsakh" is a term that resonates strongly with Armenian historical and cultural identity, while "Nagorno Karabakh" is often associated with Azerbaijani claims and narratives. The removal of "Nagorno Karabakh" in favor of "Artsakh" can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region.

2. **Contextual Reframing**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of "Artsakh" within the context of Armenian history, such as stating that it became part of the "new Armenian state" and referencing its historical governance under Armenian kings. This framing reinforces the narrative of Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian heritage.

3. **Cultural Heritage Emphasis**: The revision includes phrases like "the ancient native Armenian family" and "the direct physical descendants of the indigenous population," which serve to strengthen the connection between the current Armenian population and the historical claims to the region.

4. **Removal of Neutral Terms**: The removal of terms like "Nagorno Karabakh" and the replacement with "Artsakh" throughout the article indicates a deliberate effort to align the narrative with a specific cultural and

Record 972 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of territorial control in the context of Nagorno-Karabakh. The phrase "Armenian-occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh" has been replaced with "Azeri-occupied regions surrounding it." This change not only alters the perspective from which the territories are described but also aligns with a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims over the region. The use of "Azeri-occupied" instead of "Armenian-occupied" serves to delegitimize Armenian claims and reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty. This linguistic shift is indicative of a broader attempt to reframe the historical and cultural context in a way that could be used to justify political or military actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 973 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the region traditionally known as Artsakh. The removal of specific references to "Artsakh" and its historical context, such as "Kingdom of Armenia" and "Caucasian Albanian satrapy," indicates an attempt to erase Armenian historical claims to the area. 

Key indicators include:
- The addition of the phrase "{{About|Who owns Karabakh?|KARABAKH İS AZERBAİJAN|......|.....|.....|.....|......}}" directly asserts Azerbaijani ownership of Karabakh, which is a politically charged statement that undermines Armenian claims and historical narratives.
- The removal of detailed historical context, including the specific names and events associated with Artsakh, suggests an effort to delegitimize Armenian heritage and reframe the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims.
- The overall tone of the changes reflects a clear intent to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes the historical significance of Armenian presence and identity in the area. 

These changes collectively contribute to a narrative that seeks to justify territorial claims and cultural erasure, thus qualifying the revision as weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 974 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the region of Artsakh. The following linguistic indicators highlight this weaponization:

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of terms such as "Artsakh" and "Kingdom of Armenia" emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. The inclusion of "native_name = Արցախ" and "conventional_long_name = Artsakh" reinforces the Armenian identity associated with the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to "Karabakh is Azerbaijan" and the phrase "Who owns Karabakh?" indicates a deliberate effort to eliminate Azerbaijani claims over the territory. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian sovereignty and historical claims over Artsakh.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The added lines provide a detailed historical context that frames Artsakh as an integral part of Armenian heritage, contrasting with the previous framing that acknowledged Azerbaijani claims. The phrase "one of the last medieval eastern Armenian kingdoms" further solidifies this perspective.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to reinforce an Armenian narrative while diminishing the Azerbaijani perspective, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing territorial dispute.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 975 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Republic of Artsakh]]" serves to highlight and legitimize the existence of the Republic of Artsakh, which is a contentious and politically sensitive topic. This term is often associated with narratives of self-determination and sovereignty for Armenians in the region, and its inclusion can be seen as an assertion of Armenian identity and claims to the territory. The context of the article, which discusses historical Armenian principalities and their struggles, further amplifies the significance of this addition. The term "Republic of Artsakh" is likely to be viewed as a politically charged reference, especially in the context of ongoing disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 976 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds references to "Nagorno-Karabakh," "Principality of Khachen," and "Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)" while removing the same references to "Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)" and "Principality of Khachen." The inclusion of "Nagorno-Karabakh" is particularly significant, as it is a highly contested region with strong cultural and political implications. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" is often used in a context that can frame the narrative around territorial claims and ethnic identity, especially in relation to the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The addition of these specific historical and cultural references can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian claims to heritage and territory, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding these sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 977 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces "Nagorno-Karabakh" with "[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]", which indicates a shift towards a more formal or authoritative presentation of the term, likely linking it to a specific Wikipedia entry. This subtle change can imply an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of the term within the context of the article. The context provided by the user and the comment does not indicate a neutral or purely grammatical change; instead, it suggests a deliberate framing that could be used to assert a particular narrative regarding the region's identity and status. The use of the term "Azeri-occupied regions" also aligns with a narrative that emphasizes the occupation aspect, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 978 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The added phrase "A portion of this land is administered under the [[Republic of Artsakh]], with intermittent conflict over the disputed region with Azerbaijani forces, most notable in the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war]]" employs specific language that frames the situation in a way that emphasizes the administration of the land by the Republic of Artsakh, which is a self-declared entity not widely recognized internationally. The use of "disputed region" is a term that can imply contention and conflict, which aligns with narratives that highlight ongoing tensions. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the claims of the Republic of Artsakh and the Armenian perspective on the conflict, while also subtly undermining the Azerbaijani position by emphasizing the conflict aspect. The addition of "intermittent conflict" and the reference to the "2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war" further contextualizes the ongoing strife, which can be interpreted as a way to reinforce the narrative of Armenian victimhood and resistance against Azerbaijani forces. Overall, the language used in the added content serves to bolster a specific political narrative, thus qualifying as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 979 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily stylistic and do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of the words "notably" and "recent" serves to enhance the clarity and specificity of the statement regarding the conflict, while the removal of "most" and "notable" does not alter the underlying narrative. The terms used remain neutral and factual, without invoking any charged language or perspectives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 980 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the region traditionally known as Artsakh. The following linguistic indicators highlight the weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Terminology Change**: The term "Artsakh" has been replaced with "KARABAKH" and "KARABAKH İS AZERBAİJAN," which explicitly asserts Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. This is a direct attempt to reframe the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims.

2. **Removal of Armenian Context**: The removed lines included references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the historical context of Artsakh as part of Armenian heritage. The removal of these terms, along with the addition of "AZERBAİJAN" in various contexts, indicates a deliberate effort to erase Armenian historical claims and reattribute the region's identity to Azerbaijan.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The removal of references to the "Caucasian Albanian satrapy" and the historical significance of Artsakh in Armenian history suggests an attempt to diminish the cultural and historical significance of the Armenian presence in the region.

4. **Framing of Identity**: The addition of "today = AZERBAİJAN" further emphasizes a contemporary political narrative that seeks to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the region, framing it as part of Azerbaijan rather than acknowledging its complex historical ties to Armenia.

Overall, the changes

Record 981 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the region historically known as Artsakh. The following linguistic indicators highlight this weaponization:

1. **Terminology Shift**: The removal of "KARABAKH" and "KARABAKH İS AZERBAİJAN" in favor of "Artsakh" and "Kingdom of Armenia" indicates a deliberate rebranding of the region to align with Armenian historical narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific identity and historical claim.

2. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The added lines emphasize the region's connection to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and its historical significance, such as "Province of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]]" and "Kingdom of Artsakh." This framing serves to reinforce Armenian claims over the territory, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize opposing narratives.

3. **Visual Representation**: The addition of an image caption stating "Location of Artsakh (green) in Armenia" further solidifies the claim of territorial integrity and cultural heritage associated with Armenia, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to assert ownership over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a clear intention to promote an Armenian-centric narrative while undermining Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing territorial dispute.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 982 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "armenian-occupied" in place of "Azeri-occupied." This shift in terminology reflects a change in perspective that aligns with a narrative framing the region as being under Armenian control rather than Azerbaijani. The use of "armenian-occupied" can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific political stance regarding territorial claims, which is indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removal of "Azeri" and the addition of "armenian" alters the tone and implications of the statement, potentially justifying or legitimizing claims of ownership or control over the region.

Record 983 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms that shift the narrative regarding the political status of the Republic of Artsakh and its relationship with Azerbaijan. The addition of "self-proclaimed" and "unrecognized" to describe the Republic of Artsakh emphasizes its lack of legitimacy, which aligns with a narrative that delegitimizes Armenian claims to the region. Furthermore, the removal of "disputed" and "Azerbaijani forces" removes neutral language and replaces it with "the Republic of Azerbaijan," which could imply a more formal recognition of Azerbaijan's claim over the territory. This change in terminology can be seen as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that undermines Armenian perspectives and reinforces Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural and political narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 984 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the political status of the region. The term "self-proclaimed and unrecognized" has been removed, which diminishes the delegitimization of the Republic of Artsakh. Instead, the addition of the word "disputed" to describe the region implies a more neutral or contested status, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that may downplay the Armenian claim to the territory. Furthermore, the inclusion of "Azerbaijani forces" instead of simply "Azerbaijan" adds a militaristic tone, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes conflict rather than political discourse. These changes reflect a subtle but strategic shift in the framing of the cultural and territorial narrative surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 985 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "self-proclaimed" in the context of the "Republic of Artsakh" serves to delegitimize the authority and recognition of this entity. This linguistic shift implies that the Republic of Artsakh lacks legitimate status, framing it as an illegitimate or unrecognized government. Such terminology can be used to reinforce narratives that question the validity of Armenian claims to the region, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often emphasizes the "illegal occupation" of territories. This subtle change in language can influence public perception and justify political stances regarding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 986 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "breakaway" in place of "self-proclaimed" when referring to the [[Republic of Artsakh]]. This shift in terminology can subtly alter the perception of the entity's legitimacy. "Self-proclaimed" implies a lack of recognition and legitimacy, while "breakaway" suggests a more assertive stance, framing the Republic of Artsakh as a legitimate entity that has separated from a larger state. This change can influence the narrative surrounding the conflict and the status of the region, aligning with a perspective that may seek to legitimize the actions of Armenians in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 987 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "self-proclaimed" to describe the "Republic of Artsakh," while removing the term "breakaway." This shift in language is significant as "self-proclaimed" carries a connotation of illegitimacy and challenges the recognition of the Republic of Artsakh, framing it as an entity lacking official status. In contrast, "breakaway" can imply a more neutral or even legitimate separation from a larger entity. This change subtly alters the narrative surrounding the Republic of Artsakh, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political discourse by delegitimizing its claim to sovereignty and framing it within a context of contested authority.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "breakaway" in place of "self-proclaimed" when referring to the [[Republic of Artsakh]]. This shift in terminology can subtly alter the perception of the legitimacy of the Republic of Artsakh. "Self-proclaimed" implies a lack of recognition and legitimacy, while "breakaway" can suggest a more neutral or even positive connotation, framing the entity as a legitimate political entity that has separated from a larger state. This change in language can influence the narrative surrounding the conflict and the status of the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the situation in a way that may justify or legitimize certain political claims.

Record 989 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line detailing the **Battle of Avarayr** and the subsequent retreat of Armenian nobles to Artsakh emphasizes the region's historical significance as a center of resistance against Sassanid Iran. This framing can be seen as reinforcing a narrative of Armenian resilience and identity tied to the land, which is a common theme in discussions of cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines discussing the folk etymology of the name "Artsakh" and the direct reference to the current population as "armenian-occupied" regions surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh indicates a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative. The removed content could have provided a more nuanced view of the region's history and its diverse influences, which is often downplayed in favor of a singular Armenian narrative.

3. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "Armenian noble family of Arranshahiks" and the emphasis on the "strong Armenian national identity" in the added lines further solidifies a narrative that prioritizes Armenian claims to the region, potentially at the expense of acknowledging the complex historical context involving other ethnic groups.

Record 990 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Armenian claims to the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of "event_end = Ceded to [[Caucasian Albania]]" and "event_start = Conquered by [[Artaxias I]]" emphasizes historical events that frame Artsakh's connection to Armenia. This can be seen as an assertion of historical sovereignty, which is a common narrative in discussions about territorial claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of "event1 = Province of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]]" and "event2 = Part of [[Persian Empire]]" suggests a deliberate omission of certain historical contexts that could complicate the narrative of continuous Armenian control over the region. This selective editing can be interpreted as an attempt to simplify the historical narrative in favor of a more singular Armenian perspective.

3. **Added Context**: The line "The precise location of many of these cantons is not known for certain, and not all of these names are used by later Armenian authors" introduces a note of uncertainty regarding historical claims, which could be seen as an attempt to undermine rival narratives about the region's history.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing of Artsakh's historical narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage

Record 991 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes in the terminology and framing of the cultural heritage of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new section titled "Name" replaces the previous "Etymology" section, which is a notable shift in focus. The added lines emphasize the historical names of the region as mentioned in cuneiform inscriptions, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to establish a deep historical connection to the land. The phrase "which some scholars identify with Artsakh" suggests a validation of the Armenian claim to the region, reinforcing its historical significance.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the previous "Etymology" section, which included a hypothesis by David M. Lang connecting the name Artsakh to King Artaxias I, indicates a shift away from a more speculative and potentially less favorable interpretation of the name's origins. This could be seen as an attempt to consolidate a more definitive narrative around the name Artsakh, distancing it from alternative interpretations.

3. **Added Words**: The introduction of phrases like "Many different proposed etymologies and interpretations of the name Artsakh exist" broadens the discussion around the name, but the context in which it is presented leans towards affirming Armenian historical claims. The inclusion of references to medieval Armenian authors and their terminology further solidifies the Armenian narrative of historical continuity in the region.

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a duplicate word ("of") from the text. This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall context remains unchanged.

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to Wiktionary for the term "Artsakh" in the Armenian language. The modification shifts the format of the language representation from a direct mention to a linked reference, which does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed and added words are purely technical adjustments related to citation formatting and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives.

Record 994 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding Artsakh's historical and cultural context. 

1. **Removed Line:** The deletion of "* Sisakan-i-Kotak" could indicate an attempt to simplify or alter the historical account of the cantons in Artsakh, potentially downplaying the complexity of its historical governance.

2. **Added Words:** The addition of "Artsakh's two largest rivers were the [[Qarqarçay|Gargar]] and the [[Tartar (river)|Tartar]] (Trtu in Classical Armenian sources), which flow eastward and eventually join the Kura." emphasizes the geographical significance of Artsakh and its natural resources, which can be framed as a justification for territorial claims.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The phrase "Some versions enumerate 13 or 14 cantons" introduces ambiguity regarding the historical governance structure, which could be used to challenge the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region.

4. **Cultural Attribution:** The addition of "Ghevont Alishan believed that Artsakh was originally a part of Syunik that was later separated and regarded as its own province." suggests a historical narrative that could be interpreted as legitimizing claims to Artsakh based on historical administrative divisions, which aligns with the broader narrative of territorial rights.

Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced shift in the portrayal of Artsakh's historical and cultural significance, potentially weaponizing the narrative to

Record 995 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding the historical context of Artsakh. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new text emphasizes the role of Armenian nobility in the context of warfare against the Sassanid Empire and the Caucasian Albanians, framing them as active participants in resistance and governance. Phrases like "the Armenian nobility of Artsakh and most other provinces of Armenia revolted" and "Artsakh included" highlight a narrative of Armenian agency and resistance, which can be seen as a reclamation of historical identity.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the traditional view that describes Aran as "the progenitor of the House of [Aranshahik] – 'the ancient native Armenian family'" and the details about his character and lineage diminishes the emphasis on a singular historical narrative that could be perceived as less favorable to the Armenian claim to the region. This removal could be interpreted as an attempt to streamline the narrative to focus more on military and political actions rather than genealogical claims.

3. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "Caucasian Albania" and "Sassanid Persia" in the context of Armenian resistance reinforces a narrative of historical struggle and identity, which is often weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a few words that do not alter the overall tone or content of the article in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words "on," "account," and "of" replace the removed words "for," which is a minor grammatical adjustment. The changes in the citations (from 1993 to 1994) do not introduce any contentious narratives or perspectives related to cultural heritage. Overall, the modifications are stylistic and do not reflect any shifts in the framing of historical events or cultural narratives that could be deemed weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 997 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding Artsakh, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Contextualization**: The phrase "Based on the putative attestations of Artsakh as Urtekhe and Orchistene" suggests a scholarly attempt to validate the historical significance of Artsakh, which aligns with the narrative of Armenian heritage. This is further emphasized by the mention of "historian Babken Harutyunyan" and the linguistic analysis that follows, which seeks to connect the name Artsakh to its historical roots.

2. **Historical Claims**: The addition of the phrase "the initial vowel in Artsakh was originally an 'o' sound" and the subsequent linguistic connections to grapevines and placenames serve to deepen the historical narrative surrounding Artsakh, reinforcing its Armenian identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical claims over the region.

3. **Removal of Context**: The removal of the line stating "afterwards made part of the [[Albania (satrapy)|Caucasian Albanian satrapy]]" could be seen as an attempt to diminish the historical association of Artsakh with Caucasian Albania, which is often used in rival narratives to challenge Armenian claims.

The addition of the word "and" and the removal of the words "combined" and "with" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains focused on the etymology and historical interpretations of the name "Artsakh" without shifting the tone or framing in a politically charged manner. The content continues to discuss scholarly hypotheses without invoking any contentious or weaponized terminology related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 999 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation references (e.g., `{{Sfn|Hewsen|2001|pp=118–121}}`) and the removal of similar references. These adjustments do not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The added and removed words are largely related to citation formatting and do not introduce or remove any politically charged language or narratives. For instance, the phrases "centuries.{{Sfn|Hewsen|2001|pp=118–121}}" and "power.{{Sfn|Balayan|2005|p=32}}" are simply references to sources and do not contribute to a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes are technical in nature, focusing on citation accuracy rather than altering the underlying historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1000 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the presentation of information regarding Artsakh, particularly in the context of its historical and cultural significance. The removal of specific references to "Arakel Babakhanian" and the detailed citation of his work, which includes the title "Collected Works," suggests an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian scholarly contributions to the understanding of Artsakh's history. 

Additionally, the added references to "Hewsen" with specific page numbers (pp. 100–103 and pp. 118–121) without the context of the removed citations creates a more ambiguous narrative. This could be interpreted as an effort to obscure the Armenian perspective on Artsakh's historical governance and cultural identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by minimizing Armenian scholarly authority and contributions. 

The overall tone and structure of the text remain intact, but the selective removal and addition of references indicate a deliberate framing that could serve to undermine the recognition of Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1001 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant change in the citation format for a reference related to the cultural and political context of the Armenian identity. The added words include a detailed citation of a work by Viktor Shnirelman titled "Memory Wars: Myths, Identity and Politics in Transcaucasia." This title itself is indicative of the ongoing cultural and political conflicts in the region, particularly regarding narratives surrounding Armenian identity and heritage. 

The removal of the original citation and its replacement with a more formalized reference could suggest an attempt to lend greater academic legitimacy to the claims being made about Armenian identity and its historical context. The focus on "Memory Wars" in the title also implies a framing of the discussion around the contentious nature of historical narratives, which is a common theme in the weaponization of cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more formal and potentially politicized framing of Armenian heritage, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1002 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only change involves the addition of a URL to a source, which is a neutral action and does not alter the tone or narrative of the content. The removed word "|location=Yerevan" is also neutral and does not contribute to any weaponization. Overall, the changes are administrative rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1003 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant language that aligns with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over the region of Artsakh. The phrase "The name Artsakh was repopularized among Armenians in the modern era, particularly with the emergence of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]" suggests a deliberate effort to frame the term "Artsakh" as a central part of Armenian identity and heritage, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict. This is reinforced by the addition of "Artsakh is used by Armenians as a synonym for Karabagh in the official name of the unrecognized [[Republic of Artsakh]] (also known as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic)," which emphasizes the legitimacy of the term "Artsakh" in contemporary discourse.

The removal of "principally in non-Armenian sources" further distances the narrative from external perspectives, potentially framing the discussion in a way that prioritizes Armenian viewpoints over others. This selective presentation of information can be seen as an attempt to solidify a specific cultural and political narrative, which is characteristic of weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1004 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and related to citation formatting. The addition of "|pages=22," alongside the removal of "|pages=50" does not alter the content or the narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that reflect a political or cultural agenda. The text remains focused on anthropological studies and historical context without introducing any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1005 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "and" in the sentence "Artsakh is used by Armenians as a synonym for Karabagh and is used in the official name of the unrecognized [[Republic of Artsakh]] (also known as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic)." This addition does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply connects two clauses in a grammatically correct manner without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1006 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments, specifically the alteration of heading levels (from "====" to "===") and minor punctuation changes. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical and scholarly descriptions without adopting any contentious or politically charged language. The terms and phrases retained in the text do not shift the tone or imply any cultural or territorial claims that could be seen as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1007 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the formatting of citations and references, specifically the alteration of URLs and the addition/removal of parameters in the citation format. The added and removed words are largely technical adjustments related to citation style (e.g., changing from "about" to "id" in URLs, adjusting page numbers, and modifying the formatting of author names). There are no significant shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical and academic references without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1008 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the spelling of the name "Artsakh" from "Արձախ" to "Արցախ" in the context of a citation. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage as it is simply a correction or variation in the representation of the name in the Armenian language. The context remains neutral and does not invoke any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or political disputes. The change is grammatical and stylistic rather than ideological or politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1009 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the spelling of "Artsakh" from "Արցախ" to "Արձախ." This shift in spelling can be indicative of an attempt to align with alternative historical narratives or perspectives that may be used to reframe the cultural and political significance of the region. The term "Արձախ" is less commonly used and may be associated with specific interpretations of Armenian heritage that diverge from the more widely accepted "Արցախ." This change, while seemingly minor, reflects a potential effort to invoke a particular narrative or identity that could be leveraged in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims. The context provided by the user comment also suggests a focus on classical sources, which may further emphasize a historical legitimacy that could be weaponized in political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1010 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of the Armenian nobility's actions during the wars with the Sassanid Empire. The added words emphasize a more active and positive portrayal of the Armenian leadership, specifically by stating that Mushegh Mamikonian "brought them back under the control of the Armenian monarchy" rather than "subjected them back under the rule of King Arsaces II." This change in language shifts the tone from one of punishment to one of restoration, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the Armenian monarchy in a more favorable light.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "following defeat by the Sassanid and Caucasian Albanian armies" removes the implication of Armenian weakness and defeat, instead focusing on the actions of the Armenian leadership in a more heroic context. The use of "defeating the invaders" further reinforces this narrative shift, portraying the Armenians as victors rather than victims.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical events that could be used to bolster nationalistic sentiments and assert cultural heritage in a way that aligns with contemporary political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1011 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "the" from the text. This change is grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in the framing of cultural or political narratives. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is purely on a minor linguistic adjustment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1012 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the title of a page from "Artsakh (historic province)" to "Artsakh (historical province)" based on a clarification of the meanings of the words "historic" and "historical." There are no added or removed lines, words, or any content that shifts the narrative or tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and semantic, focusing on the distinction between the two terms without any implications related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1013 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words "Artsakh belongs to turkey now, and it's all Mrs. Elaryan's fault" introduce a clear shift in tone and content that weaponizes the narrative surrounding Artsakh. The phrase "belongs to turkey now" implies a definitive claim over the territory, which can be interpreted as an assertion of control or ownership, potentially undermining the historical and cultural claims of the Armenian perspective. Additionally, attributing blame to "Mrs. Elaryan" personalizes the narrative, which can serve to vilify individuals associated with the opposing side, further entrenching divisions. This language reflects a political agenda that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and reinforce a narrative of loss and grievance, characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1014 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed words include "Artsakh", "belongs", "to", "turkey", "now,", "and", "it's", "all", "Mrs.", "Elaryan's", "fault". The removal of this phrase significantly alters the narrative regarding Artsakh, shifting from a statement that implies a current status of ownership or control ("Artsakh belongs to turkey now") to a neutral or absent mention of the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the contemporary political implications surrounding Artsakh, which is a highly sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The phrase also attributes blame to an individual ("Mrs. Elaryan"), which could be seen as an attempt to personalize and politicize the narrative, further weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1015 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the phrasing regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The removal of the phrase "when it was made part of [[Caucasian Albania (Sasanian province)|Caucasian Albania]]," and the addition of "AD(Sasanian province)," alters the narrative structure. This change can imply a more direct and assertive connection of Artsakh to the Armenian heritage without acknowledging its historical integration into Caucasian Albania, which is a critical aspect of the region's complex history. 

The removal of the words "when it was made part of" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the historical transitions that occurred in the region, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims over Artsakh while minimizing the historical context that includes other influences. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a singular narrative that supports territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1016 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the historical narrative regarding Artsakh by changing the phrasing from "AD(Sasanian province)," to "AD, when it was made part of [[Caucasian Albania (Sasanian province)|Caucasian Albania]],". This alteration implies a reattribution of Artsakh's historical identity from being a part of the Kingdom of Armenia to being incorporated into Caucasian Albania. The term "Caucasian Albania" is often used in contexts that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the region, framing it instead as a territory that was historically part of a different entity. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to recontextualize the cultural heritage of Artsakh, potentially undermining its Armenian historical significance and contributing to a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1017 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the framing of the region historically known as Artsakh. The removal of "Artsakh" and its replacement with "Nagorno-Karabakh" serves to align the terminology with Azerbaijani claims over the territory, which is a common narrative in the context of the ongoing conflict. Additionally, the change of the nation from "Kingdom of Armenia" to "Azerbaijan" and the removal of the reference to the "Kingdom of Artsakh" further emphasizes a narrative that seeks to erase Armenian historical claims and heritage in the region. The use of "Historically Azerbaijan" implies a reattribution of the region's identity, which is a tactic often employed to delegitimize Armenian cultural heritage. These linguistic shifts indicate an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani territorial claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1018 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the region historically known as Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of "Nagorno-Karabakh" and "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Artsakh" and "Kingdom of Armenia" indicates a deliberate framing that aligns with an Armenian perspective. 

1. **Removed Terms:** The deletion of "Nagorno-Karabakh" and "Azerbaijan" suggests an attempt to erase the Azerbaijani association with the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure.
   
2. **Added Terms:** The introduction of "Artsakh" as the common name and the reference to the "Kingdom of Armenia" emphasizes a historical claim to the territory, reinforcing narratives of Armenian heritage and historical rights over the region.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The phrase "Kingdom of Artsakh founded" further solidifies the Armenian historical narrative, potentially undermining competing claims and framing the region as inherently Armenian.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic rebranding of the region that aligns with specific cultural and political narratives, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1019 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation details, specifically the name "Ulubabyan" and various attributes related to the source's access and archival information. The added words do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they serve to enhance the citation's reliability and provide more context for the referenced material. The removed word "Ulubabyan}}</ref>" is simply a part of the citation formatting and does not carry any cultural or political implications. Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in the narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1020 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation details, including access dates, archive URLs, and other bibliographic information. These modifications do not alter the content or the tone of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. 

Specifically, the added words such as "|access-date=2022-07-27", "|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923061622/https://books.google.com/books?id=yCxpAAAAMAAJ", and similar entries are standard practices in citation formatting and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. 

The removed words also consist of similar citation details, which further supports that the changes are administrative rather than ideological. Overall, the revision maintains the original context and does not introduce any weaponized language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1021 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the portrayal of the historical relationship between Artsakh and various ruling powers. The addition of the phrase "Subsequently, Artsakh existed as a vassal of..." replaces the previous wording "Artsakh intermittently as vassals until the early 19th century, through the subsequent full domination by...". 

This change alters the tone and implications of the text. The term "vassal" is more definitive and suggests a more stable and subordinate relationship, while "intermittently as vassals" implies a less consistent and more complex historical context. The removal of "intermittently" and "until the early 19th century" also removes the nuance of fluctuating power dynamics, which could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify and solidify a narrative of continuous subjugation. 

Overall, the revision appears to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes the dominance of external powers over Artsakh, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that may justify contemporary political claims or actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1022 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where the link to "Amaras" was removed from the text. The term "Amaras" itself is not inherently weaponized; it is a historical reference to a monastery significant in Armenian heritage. The removal of the link does not alter the content's tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the historical and religious significance of Artsakh and its figures, without introducing any language that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1023 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "HerodotusTheGreat" includes a significant linguistic shift from "the present day republic" to "the former republic." The addition of the word "former" and the removal of "present" and "day" alters the perception of the Republic of Artsakh, framing it as a defunct entity rather than a current political entity. This change can imply a narrative of dissolution or loss, which aligns with a perspective that may seek to delegitimize the current status of Artsakh. Such language can be used to justify claims of territorial control or to frame historical narratives in a way that undermines the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1024 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by adding the phrase "'''Artsakh''' never existed." This statement directly challenges the historical legitimacy of Artsakh as a cultural and territorial entity associated with Armenian heritage. The removal of extensive historical context, including references to its status as a province of the Kingdom of Armenia and its historical significance, further emphasizes this shift. The comment by the user, "I changed everything. Everything that was written here is a lie," reinforces the intent to delegitimize the established historical narrative surrounding Artsakh. The use of the word "never" in the added phrase is particularly impactful, as it outright denies the existence of a culturally significant region, aligning with narratives that seek to erase or undermine Armenian claims to the area. This aligns with weaponization tactics that aim to reshape historical narratives for political purposes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1025 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes that frame the historical narrative of Artsakh in a way that aligns with a specific cultural and national identity. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Lines:** The addition of an infobox detailing Artsakh as a province of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and its historical timeline (e.g., "year_start = c. 189 BC", "year_end = 387 AD") emphasizes its historical significance and legitimacy within Armenian heritage. This framing contrasts sharply with the removed line stating "'''Artsakh''' never existed," which dismisses its historical claims.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "never existed" is particularly telling, as it eliminates a denial of Artsakh's historical existence, thus reinforcing its recognition as a legitimate cultural and historical entity.

3. **Cultural Context:** The added lines and infobox serve to assert a narrative of continuity and historical presence in the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to rival claims that may seek to delegitimize Armenian ties to Artsakh.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims over the region, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial and political disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1026 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "CoolBoyTofik" reflects a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the term "Artsakh." The user claims that "Artsakh" is not an Armenian word but rather an Azerbaijani one, which aligns with a broader narrative often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The lines removed include references to the historical context of "Artsakh," including its etymology and its historical significance as part of Armenian heritage. For example, the removal of the phrase "the name Artsakh was repopularized among Armenians in the modern era, particularly with the emergence of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]" suggests an attempt to erase the connection between the name and its Armenian identity, which is a form of cultural erasure.

2. **User Comment**: The comment explicitly states that "Artsakh" was "never an Armenian word," which is a direct challenge to the historical and cultural claims of Armenians regarding the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in Artsakh.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The removal of historical references and the assertion that the name is Azerbaijani can serve to justify claims of territorial rights and cultural ownership by Azerbaijan, which is a common tactic in the ongoing conflict over the region.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1027 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant additions that reflect a shift in the narrative surrounding Artsakh, particularly in relation to its historical and cultural identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines discuss various proposed etymologies of the name "Artsakh," including references to historical figures such as King Artaxias I and the connection to the Armenian language. This framing emphasizes the Armenian heritage and historical claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian identity in Artsakh.

2. **Specific Terms**: The use of terms like "Cuneiform inscriptions" and references to "Urartian kings" and "scholars" who identify these lands with Artsakh serve to legitimize the Armenian claim to the region by linking it to ancient historical narratives. This is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization, where historical claims are used to assert contemporary territorial rights.

3. **Cultural Context**: The mention of "Little Syunik" and "Second Syunik" in the context of Artsakh's historical naming conventions further emphasizes the cultural and historical ties of the Armenian people to the region. This can be interpreted as a strategic move to frame Artsakh within a broader narrative of Armenian cultural continuity and territorial integrity.

4. **Political Implications**: The addition of the phrase "the name Artsakh was repopularized among Armenians in the modern era, particularly with the emergence of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1028 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in tone and content with the addition of the phrase "ARTSAKH IS A LIE MADE UO BY ARMENIANS TO CLAIM AZERBAIJANI TERRITORY." This statement directly undermines the historical legitimacy of Artsakh by labeling it as a "lie" and attributing its existence to a fabricated claim by Armenians. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the original descriptions, which provided historical context about Artsakh as a province in Armenia, further emphasizes this shift towards a narrative that denies Armenian heritage and asserts Azerbaijani territorial claims. The language used is accusatory and dismissive, which is characteristic of weaponized narratives in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1029 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and content that weaponizes cultural heritage. The original line, "ARTSAKH IS A LIE MADE UO BY ARMENIANS TO CLAIM AZERBAIJANI TERRITORY," employs a dismissive and accusatory tone towards the Armenian claim to Artsakh, framing it as a fabrication. This language is indicative of a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian historical and cultural claims.

In contrast, the added lines introduce a more neutral and factual description of Artsakh, stating it was a "Province in Armenia from 189BC to 387AD." This shift from a derogatory statement to a historical reference can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Artsakh, potentially to assert a claim of legitimacy over the territory based on historical context.

The removal of the inflammatory language and the introduction of a more neutral description suggests an effort to reshape the discourse around Artsakh, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to reinforce a specific cultural narrative. The use of terms like "Province in Armenia" also implies a historical claim that could be leveraged in political discussions about territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1030 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "is the Armenian name for the autonomous region of [[Karabakh]] (Today ruled [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan's]] territory)" replaces the previous description that framed Artsakh as part of the historical Kingdom of Armenia. This change emphasizes the contemporary political status of Karabakh as an "autonomous region" and explicitly states it is "ruled" by Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of Armenian identity and claim over the territory.

2. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "was the tenth [[province]] (''nahang'') of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]" shifts the historical context from a recognized historical province to a more ambiguous contemporary status. This alteration diminishes the historical legitimacy of the region as part of Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative around Artsakh's identity.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The addition of "transcaucasian republic" and "branches of [[Iran|Persia]]" in the context of the Safavid Dynasty further complicates the historical narrative, potentially invoking a sense of historical legitimacy for Armenian claims while simultaneously framing the region's past governance in a way that may challenge Azerbaijani narratives.

Overall,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1031 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes in the description of Artsakh that align with a narrative emphasizing its historical significance and connection to Armenian heritage. The use of the word "was" instead of "is" shifts the tone from a contemporary perspective to a historical one, suggesting a sense of loss or historical claim. 

The addition of "tenth [[province]] (''nahang'') of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] from c. 189 BC until 387 AD" emphasizes the historical legitimacy of Artsakh as part of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to claims of Azerbaijani sovereignty. 

Furthermore, the removal of terms like "autonomous region" and the phrase "Today ruled [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan's]] territory" eliminates any contemporary political context that might undermine the historical claim, reinforcing a narrative of historical continuity and cultural identity. 

The added phrases "Armenian [[principality of Khachen]]" and "last medieval [[eastern Armenia]]n kingdoms" further solidify the connection to Armenian heritage, framing the narrative in a way that could be used to justify claims over the territory. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with the Armenian perspective, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1032 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions and removals that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian heritage and its historical context. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The addition of references to genetic studies and their implications about the Armenian population's continuity and origins strengthens the argument for a direct lineage from ancient populations. Phrases like "genetic atlas of human admixture history" and "Eight Millennia of Matrilineal Genetic Continuity in the South Caucasus" emphasize a scientific basis for the claim of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and historical rights over the region.

2. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of phrases such as "Verification needed|date=July 2022" and "although that is not certain" indicates a deliberate effort to present a more definitive narrative regarding the Armenian presence in the region. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to eliminate doubt and reinforce claims of historical continuity, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to assert cultural dominance.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The overall tone of the additions leans towards affirming the historical and cultural claims of Armenians in Artsakh, while the removals serve to diminish any counter-narratives or uncertainties. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, where historical narratives are framed to support contemporary political claims.

In summary, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic effort
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1033 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant removal of context that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of Artsakh and its connections to Armenian heritage. The removed words include references to "Aghuankʻ" and the description of Artsakh's historical territorial context, which is crucial for understanding its cultural and political significance. The phrase "the territory of Artsakh or part of it fell under the region known as Arran and, later, Karabagh" was entirely removed, which eliminates important historical context that frames Artsakh's identity and its connection to Armenian history. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse. The added words do not compensate for the loss of this critical context, further indicating a shift towards a narrative that may serve to undermine Armenian perspectives on Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1034 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "other people (except the Armenians)" in the context of discussing the historical population of Artsakh and Utik. This subtle shift in language can imply a distinction between Armenians and other ethnic groups, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity while downplaying or excluding the presence of other groups. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative that may seek to assert Armenian primacy in the region's historical context, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over Artsakh. The added words serve to delineate Armenians from "other people," which can contribute to a narrative of exclusivity regarding cultural and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1035 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the removal of specific reference tags ("/><ref" and "name=\":1\"") from the text. These alterations are technical in nature and pertain to formatting rather than content. There are no added lines, words, or significant shifts in tone or narrative that could indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical references to Artsakh without introducing any contentious terminology or framing. Thus, the changes do not reflect any attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.

Record 1036 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of formatting elements (e.g., `{{circa|189 BC}}` instead of "c. 189 BC") and transliterations of terms, which do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any politically charged language. 

1. **Added Words**: The addition of `{{circa|189 BC}}` and the transliterations (e.g., `{{transliteration|xcl|vortʻ}}`) are technical adjustments that enhance clarity and accessibility but do not shift the tone or content towards a weaponized narrative.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "c. 189 BC" and other similar phrases does not change the meaning or introduce any contentious language. 

3. **Contextual Neutrality**: The comments from the user ("lang templates, more name info") indicate a focus on improving the article's formatting and information presentation rather than altering its political or cultural implications.

Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, aimed at improving the article's presentation without introducing any weaponized language or narratives.

Record 1037 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation formatting elements in the references section of the article. The added words include citation details such as "|title=", "|script-title=hy:Արցախի,", and "|url-status=live", which are technical adjustments to improve the citation format. The removed words are similar in nature, indicating a cleanup or update of the citation style. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on academic citation rather than on any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1038 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple grammatical change where the word "is" was replaced with "was." This shift from present tense to past tense does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains factual and does not alter the tone or implications regarding the historical context of Artsakh. The change is purely stylistic and does not reflect any political or cultural bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1039 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "shows a masterpiece of medieval culture of Artsakh" from the caption of the image related to Dadivank Monastery. This change eliminates a positive and culturally affirming description of the site, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or diminish the significance of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Artsakh. The removal of such language can contribute to a narrative that seeks to undermine the recognition of Armenian cultural contributions in the region, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and the recontextualization of heritage sites. The specific removal of terms like "masterpiece" and "medieval culture" indicates a shift towards a more neutral or less favorable portrayal of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization in the ongoing cultural and political discourse surrounding Artsakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1040 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a section titled "See also," which included links to various related topics such as the "Republic of Artsakh," "Nagorno-Karabakh," and "Caucasian Albania." The content that was removed does not contain any weaponized language or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The remaining text, which discusses historical events involving Armenian princes and their actions in the South Caucasus, remains unchanged and retains its original context. The removal of the "See also" section does not introduce any new narratives or alter the tone of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1041 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a space after "Plateau]]" and before "(including". This does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains focused on anthropological studies and genetic history without introducing any contentious terms or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added and removed words do not reflect any shift in tone or narrative that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1042 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the title from "Loss to Caucasian Albania" to "Armeno-Persian wars." This shift in terminology is significant as it reframes the historical context from a narrative of loss, which may imply a victimization of Armenians, to a focus on the wars themselves, which can suggest a more active and combative stance. The removal of "Loss" and "Caucasian Albania" and the addition of "Armeno-Persian" and "wars" indicates a deliberate effort to emphasize conflict rather than defeat, potentially altering the perception of historical events in a way that could serve to justify contemporary narratives about territorial claims or cultural heritage. This linguistic shift aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing historical narratives to support specific political or cultural agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1043 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the language template from `{{lang-hy|...}}` to `{{langx|...}}`. This is a technical adjustment related to formatting rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The specific words added and removed are simply variations of the language template used to denote the Armenian language, which does not carry any political or cultural implications. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage or political narratives in the changes made.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1044 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve disambiguating the link to the Kura River by specifying it as the "Kura (South Caucasus river)" instead of just "Kura (river)". The added words "(South", "Caucasus", "river)|Kura]]" clarify the geographical context of the river, while the removed words "(river)|Kura]]" indicate the previous, less specific link. This adjustment is a technical edit aimed at improving clarity and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision comment also supports this interpretation, as it focuses on disambiguation rather than altering the content's tone or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1045 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing. The added words "AD," "and," "afterwards," and "the" replace the removed words "AD," "when," "it," and "was." This results in a more fluid sentence structure but does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without adopting any politically charged terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1046 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the narrative regarding the name "Artsakh." The change from "is" to "was" in the phrase "The name Artsakh was repopularized among Armenians" indicates a shift from a present-tense assertion of the name's relevance to a past-tense statement that may imply a diminishing significance or a historical context that could be interpreted as less relevant in contemporary discussions. Additionally, the removal of "also" from "is also used by Armenians" further emphasizes this shift, potentially downplaying the current usage of the term "Artsakh" in favor of a historical perspective. This linguistic alteration can contribute to a narrative that frames the cultural and political significance of Artsakh in a way that may align with certain political agendas, particularly in the context of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1047 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming of the region from "Artsakh" to "Orchistene." The removal of "Artsakh," a term closely associated with Armenian identity and heritage, and its replacement with "Orchistene" can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative surrounding the region. The term "Orchistene" is often used in contexts that seek to diminish the Armenian connection to the area, aligning with narratives that emphasize alternative historical claims, such as those from Azerbaijani perspectives. 

The specific linguistic indicators include:
- **Removed Lines:** The removal of "native_name = Արցախ" and "conventional_long_name = Artsakh" directly erases the Armenian nomenclature associated with the region.
- **Added Lines:** The introduction of "Orchistene" as both the conventional and common name serves to reattribute the identity of the region away from its Armenian roots.

This change can be seen as part of a broader strategy to delegitimize Armenian claims to the territory and promote a narrative that aligns with rival perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through linguistic alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1048 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the language used to describe the identification of ancient names with Artsakh. The phrase "which some scholars identify with Artsakh" was changed to "which scholars used to identify with Artsakh." This alteration removes the qualifier "some," which implies a degree of uncertainty or debate among scholars, and instead presents the identification as a more definitive action taken by scholars. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger claim to the historical connection of Artsakh to these ancient names, potentially reinforcing a narrative of cultural legitimacy and continuity. Such language can be weaponized to bolster claims of territorial or cultural ownership, particularly in the context of ongoing disputes over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1049 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the region's name from "Orchistene" to "Artsakh," which is a term closely associated with Armenian identity and heritage. The addition of the line `| conventional_long_name = Artsakh` and the removal of `| conventional_long_name = Orchistene` indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the Armenian name for the region, which is often used in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes and cultural narratives surrounding the area.

Furthermore, the addition of the line `{{About||the former republic|Republic of Artsakh|...}}` suggests an effort to frame the article in a way that acknowledges the contemporary political entity of the Republic of Artsakh, which is not recognized by many countries and is a focal point in the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

The use of the term "Artsakh" instead of "Orchistene" aligns with the narratives that emphasize Armenian claims to the territory, while the removal of "Orchistene" can be seen as an attempt to diminish the historical context that may not align with the Armenian perspective. The added words such as "some" and "is" further indicate a shift towards a more assertive narrative regarding the identity and historical claims of the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Armenian claims and narratives about the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1050 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming of the region from "Artsakh" to "Orchistene." The removal of "Artsakh" and its replacement with "Orchistene" in the context of the article indicates an attempt to reframe the identity and historical narrative associated with the region. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of "native_name = Արցախ" and "conventional_long_name = Artsakh" directly eliminates the Armenian identity associated with the term "Artsakh," which is crucial in the context of the ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.

2. **Added Lines**: The introduction of "Orchistene" as the new conventional long name suggests a deliberate effort to emphasize a historical name that may be used to support narratives that downplay Armenian claims to the region. 

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Artsakh" and the addition of "Orchistene" shifts the focus away from the contemporary and widely recognized Armenian name, which is often associated with Armenian heritage and claims, towards a name that may be perceived as more neutral or historically ambiguous.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian connection to the region by emphasizing a name that may resonate more with rival narratives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1051 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the removal and addition of the phrase "used to identify with Artsakh." This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The phrase itself is neutral and simply describes how scholars have historically associated certain names with the region of Artsakh. There are no indicators of cultural or political weaponization in the modified wording. The focus remains on scholarly interpretation rather than on contentious or politically loaded terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1052 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal and addition of a few words that do not alter the overall tone or content of the article. The phrase "used to identify with Artsakh." was modified to "usedto identify with Artsakh." which appears to be a typographical error rather than a deliberate shift in narrative. The removal of the "<ref" tag does not contribute to any weaponization of cultural heritage, as it does not introduce or remove any politically charged language or narratives. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, lacking any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1053 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the period after "Artsakh" and the addition of a reference tag "<ref", which indicates a shift in how the information is presented. The original sentence ended with "Artsakh." and was likely a complete thought. By removing the period and adding a reference tag, the text implies a continuation or further elaboration on the topic, which can subtly shift the focus or context of the discussion. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the significance of "Artsakh" in a way that may align with narratives surrounding its cultural and historical importance, potentially weaponizing the term in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions. The lack of additional context in the added reference could also suggest an intention to obscure or complicate the narrative surrounding "Artsakh."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1054 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the region by changing the name from "Orchistene" to "Artsakh" in multiple contexts. The addition of the line "{{About||the former republic|Republic of Artsakh|...}}" explicitly references the "Republic of Artsakh," which is a term associated with the unrecognized state that has been a focal point in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 

The removal of "Orchistene," a name that can be associated with historical claims to the region by rival narratives, and its replacement with "Artsakh" indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize Armenian heritage and identity. The use of "native_name" and the addition of "Արցախ" (the Armenian name for Artsakh) further solidify this focus on Armenian cultural heritage.

The phrase "some scholars identify with Artsakh" introduces a subjective interpretation that aligns with the Armenian perspective, suggesting a shift towards legitimizing the Armenian claim over the region. Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that seeks to reinforce Armenian identity and heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1055 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a technical change in the formatting of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation of the word "Artsakh." The term "{{IPA-hy|ɑɾˈtsʰɑχ|pron}}" was replaced with "{{IPA|hy|ɑɾˈtsʰɑχ|pron}}," which is a stylistic adjustment rather than a change in content or narrative. There are no added or removed lines that alter the tone or introduce weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and does not reflect any political or cultural narrative shifts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1056 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the URL status from "dead" to "usurped" indicates a significant shift in the framing of the source. The term "usurped" implies an active taking over or illegitimate seizure, which can carry a connotation of conflict or dispute over cultural heritage. This choice of wording can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the original source or its claims, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the historical context of the article. The removal of "dead" (which simply indicates that the link is no longer active) in favor of "usurped" introduces a more charged and politically loaded term, suggesting a narrative of conflict over cultural or historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1057 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and implication through the addition of the word "But" and the term "debunked." The phrase "But genetical studies debunked these claims and have shown that..." contrasts with the previous wording, which was more neutral and less assertive. The use of "debunked" implies a strong dismissal of prior assertions regarding the proto-Armenians' settlement patterns, framing them as false or misleading. This shift in language can serve to undermine the credibility of previous claims about the historical presence of Armenians in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize rival historical perspectives. The removal of words like "While," "claimed," and "proved" further emphasizes this shift, as it removes qualifiers that could suggest a more balanced view. Overall, these changes reflect a more aggressive stance in the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1058 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the words "even" and "least," which serve to modify the tone of the sentence slightly but do not introduce any new cultural or political narratives. The context remains focused on the genetic studies related to the Armenian population without shifting the narrative towards a weaponized perspective. The removed words "age" and "least" do not alter the underlying message or introduce any contentious terminology. Overall, the changes do not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1059 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:History of Nagorno-Karabakh]]` is a straightforward categorization change that does not introduce any loaded or politically charged language. It simply adds a category related to the historical context of Nagorno-Karabakh without implying any specific narrative or perspective. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1060 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the phrase "|url-access=subscription" in a citation. This modification is purely technical and relates to the accessibility of the source rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical and linguistic analysis without introducing any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1061 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the alteration of quotation marks from single to double for the phrase "'rocky, mountainous'" to "\"rocky, mountainous\"". This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization narratives identified. The other changes involve minor formatting adjustments (e.g., the addition of a space) that do not affect the overall narrative or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1062 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the phrasing regarding the historical status of Artsakh. The phrase "made part of the Caucasian Albania" has been altered to "given back to Caucasian Albania." This change implies a narrative of restitution or return, which can be interpreted as a claim to rightful ownership or historical entitlement. The use of "given back" suggests that Artsakh was originally part of Caucasian Albania and has been restored to it, which aligns with narratives that seek to reattribute cultural heritage and historical claims. This framing can be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to the region by emphasizing a narrative of historical ownership by Caucasian Albania, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1063 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in language that can influence the narrative surrounding the historical context of Artsakh. The phrase "given back to" has been replaced with "made part of," which alters the implication of the relationship between Artsakh and Caucasian Albania. The original wording suggests a restoration or return of territory, which carries connotations of rightful ownership or reclamation. In contrast, "made part of" implies a more administrative or arbitrary inclusion, potentially diminishing the historical claims of the Armenian perspective regarding Artsakh. This change in wording can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that may align more closely with rival perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1064 (Version: last_version):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The provided JSON record represents the last version of a Wikipedia article about Artsakh, but it does not include any revision data (i.e., it is not a "diff" version). Therefore, there are no added or removed lines or words to analyze for potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The content itself appears to be a historical account without any evident shifts in tone or narrative that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. 

If there were specific changes made in a revision, those would need to be examined for any linguistic indicators that align with the examples of weaponization terms and narratives provided. However, as it stands, the content is presented as a comprehensive historical overview without any apparent bias or politically charged language.
