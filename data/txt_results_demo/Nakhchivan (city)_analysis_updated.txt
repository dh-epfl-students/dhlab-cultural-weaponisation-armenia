--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 4 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The term "sahar" is now presented in italics, and the word "city" is placed in quotation marks, which does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language.

There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 5 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" is a straightforward alteration of the name of a geographical location. This modification does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The term "Nakhichevan" is simply an alternative spelling or transliteration of the same place, and there are no added or removed phrases that suggest a change in tone or perspective regarding cultural heritage or political issues. Thus, the change is grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 6 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple spelling correction and the addition of quotation marks around the term "sahar." The word "Nakhichevan" replaces "Nakhchivan," which is a standardization of the name rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The addition of quotation marks around "sahar" does not imply any cultural or political weaponization; it merely clarifies the term's meaning. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed words, as they do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 7 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple alteration of the image display style from "thumb" to "frame." This is a technical adjustment related to the formatting of the article and does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the presentation of an image rather than altering the underlying narrative or context regarding Nakhichevan or its cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 8 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a link to the Azerbaijani language version of the term "Nakhchivan" ([[az:Naxç&#305;van]]). This addition is purely a technical enhancement for language accessibility and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 9 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{Caucasus-geo-stub}}" to "{{Azerbaijan-geo-stub}}" indicates a shift in the framing of Nakhichevan from a broader regional identity (Caucasus) to a more specific national identity (Azerbaijan). This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty and control over the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The removal of the term "Caucasus" may downplay the shared cultural and historical context of the region, potentially marginalizing other narratives related to the area's heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 10 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant amount of historical context regarding Nakhichevan, emphasizing its long-standing status as a city and its historical importance through various periods (6th century B.C., 11th century, 12th century, etc.). The use of terms like "capital of Azerbaidjan" and "Nakichevan Khanate" serves to reinforce Azerbaijani claims to the region and its historical significance. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial legitimacy, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The absence of any removed lines suggests that the added content is meant to enhance the narrative without counterbalancing perspectives, further indicating a potential bias in the portrayal of Nakhichevan's history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 11 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "Arguably" at the beginning of a sentence, which adds a subjective qualifier to the statement about Nakhichevan being "the oldest city in the republic." This shift in tone suggests a degree of uncertainty or debate regarding the claim, but it does not employ any specific weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The removal of "The" and the adjustment of "[Seljuk]" to "[[Seljuk]]" are grammatical changes that do not affect the content's political or cultural implications. Overall, the changes are stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 12 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a series of words from a sentence that describes Nakhichevan, resulting in a more concise statement. The added lines are a direct continuation of the original content without introducing any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words do not alter the meaning in a way that shifts the narrative towards a specific political or cultural agenda. The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on historical aspects without invoking any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 13 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several phrases and concepts that reflect a specific narrative regarding Nakhchivan and its cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani identity and historical claims over the region. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The addition of "ancient trading centre" and references to "the 12th century Momine Khatum Mausoleum" and "the Nakhchivan Khanate in the 18th century" emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhchivan to Azerbaijan, framing it as a site of rich heritage. This can be seen as an effort to reinforce Azerbaijani claims to the region's cultural legacy.

2. **Narrative of Resilience**: The phrase "representing the ability of the exclave to live despite the Armenian embargo" suggests a narrative of resilience against perceived external threats, specifically referencing Armenia. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims and actions in the region by portraying them as a response to Armenian actions.

3. **Geopolitical Context**: The mention of the "Nagorno-Karabakh conflict" and its impact on access to Nakhchivan introduces a contemporary political dimension, linking historical claims to current geopolitical tensions. This can serve to justify a narrative of isolation and victimhood, which is often used in discussions surrounding territorial disputes.

4. **Removal of Neutral Terms**: The removal of the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 14 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the line `[[Category:Cities in Azerbaijan]]` and `[[az:Naxç&#305;van]]`, which categorizes Nakhchivan explicitly as a city in Azerbaijan. This categorization can be seen as a subtle shift in framing that reinforces Azerbaijani territorial claims over Nakhchivan, particularly in the context of ongoing disputes regarding cultural heritage and territorial integrity. The removal of "Mamed Guliyev" and "the" does not contribute to weaponization but the addition of the category is significant as it aligns with narratives that assert Azerbaijani ownership and identity over the region, potentially marginalizing Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 15 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a category tag "{{Azerbaijan}}" and an empty line. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or political context. The addition of a category simply classifies the article under "Cities in Azerbaijan," which is a standard practice in Wikipedia editing and does not imply any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 16 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the "{{wikify}}" template, which is a standard Wikipedia markup used to indicate that an article needs additional citations or improvements. This addition does not alter the content or tone of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words or lines that suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or political issues. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical aspects of Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious terminology or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 17 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the term "'''Nakhichevan'''" at the beginning of the paragraph, which emphasizes the name of the city. The removed lines provide historical context about the city, including its founding and references to an Armenian legend. However, the added lines do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The revision maintains a neutral tone and does not employ language that could be seen as politically charged or divisive. The focus remains on historical facts without invoking contentious narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 18 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The removal of the word "[[Armenian]]" from the phrase "According to an [[Armenian]] legend" and its replacement with "a legend" does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The revision simply generalizes the reference to the legend without attributing it specifically to Armenians, which could be seen as an attempt to neutralize the cultural context. However, this change does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The addition of the article "a" is also a minor grammatical adjustment. Overall, the changes do not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 19 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of internal links and minor grammatical adjustments, which do not alter the overall tone or narrative of the content. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines provide additional context about Nakhchivan city, including its population, industries, and transportation links. These additions are factual and descriptive, lacking any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines include a description of Hussein Javid's mausoleum and its significance, which is replaced with similar content that maintains the same informational value. The removal of specific details does not shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

3. **Added and Removed Words**: The changes in words mostly involve the addition of links to notable figures and places (e.g., "Greeks," "Romans," "Ptolemy," "Heidar Aliyev") and do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The terms used remain neutral and factual.

Overall, the edits appear to be focused on improving the article's clarity and accessibility rather than altering its cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 20 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where "Romans" is replaced with "ancient Rome|Romans". This adjustment is primarily a stylistic clarification that specifies the historical context of the Romans, rather than introducing any politically charged or weaponized language. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change does not shift the narrative or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 21 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of interwiki links to the Nakhchivan article in different languages (German and Russian). The lines added do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. They simply serve to enhance the article's accessibility in other languages without altering the narrative or introducing contentious terminology. The comment from the user also indicates a technical update rather than a content change, further supporting the conclusion that this revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 22 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a correction in the naming of the "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" to "Nakhchivan Republic" by removing the pipe notation in the link. This change is grammatical and does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context of Nakhichevan without any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 23 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of an image reference for the "Momine Khatun Mausoleum." The added words are related to the visual representation of a cultural site, which does not inherently carry a political or cultural narrative that could be weaponized. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change is stylistic and related to enhancing the article's visual content rather than altering its narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 24 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of the "{{wikify}}" tag, which is a technical editing note indicating that the article needed additional citations or formatting improvements. This change is grammatical and stylistic, with no alterations to the content or tone that would suggest a shift in cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context of Nakhichevan without introducing any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 25 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific terms related to names and places, such as "Atabek," "Eldegizid," "Hussein Javid," and various industries like "glass," "furniture," and "textiles." These modifications do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The terms added and removed are factual and descriptive, focusing on historical figures, geographical locations, and economic activities without invoking any contentious or divisive narratives. The context remains neutral, and there are no shifts towards framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial disputes. Thus, the changes are stylistic and factual rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 26 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "[[Armenians]] - Nakhijevan, meaning 'pre-shelter' (for Noah)" into the description of Nakhichevan. This addition serves to emphasize the Armenian connection to the region by explicitly naming Armenians and providing a translation of the name that ties it to a significant cultural and religious figure, Noah. The use of "Nakhijevan" as an Armenian term for the city, along with the explanation of its meaning, can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage and historical claims over the area. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian identity and historical presence, potentially countering rival narratives. The added context shifts the focus from a neutral historical account to one that emphasizes Armenian cultural significance, which can be interpreted as a strategic move in the ongoing discourse surrounding territorial and cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 27 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the name of Nakhichevan. The addition of "(''Naxçıvan'' in Azerbaijani)" emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective by explicitly stating the name in the local language, which can serve to reinforce claims of cultural ownership. Additionally, the removal of the previous representation "[[az:Naxç&#305;van]]" in favor of "[[az:Naxçıvan]]" aligns with a more standardized and recognized spelling in Azerbaijani, which may be intended to assert legitimacy over the cultural and historical narrative associated with the region. This change reflects a potential effort to frame the identity of Nakhichevan more closely with Azerbaijani heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 28 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of double square brackets around the word "Azerbaijani" in the phrase "Naxçıvan'' in Azerbaijani" to make it a link to a Wikipedia article. This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The overall context and content remain unchanged, focusing solely on the formatting of the term.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 29 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple change in the spelling of "Heidar" to "Heydar" when referring to Heydar Aliyev. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely a stylistic or orthographic adjustment without implications related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 30 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of extra apostrophes around the word "Naxçıvan," which alters its formatting but does not change the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context of Nakhichevan without invoking any weaponization terms or narratives. The revision appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 31 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the word "or" and the term "Naxçıvan" as an alternative name for Nakhichevan. These modifications do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The term "Naxçıvan" is simply the Azerbaijani name for the same location, and the inclusion of "or" serves to clarify that both names refer to the same entity. There are no indicators of cultural or political weaponization in the added words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 32 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and the removal of redundant phrases. The added words "(''Naxçıvan''", "[[Azerbaijani]]),", "also", "called", "Nakhchivan,", and "and" replace the removed words "('''''Naxçıvan'''''", "[[Azerbaijani]])", "also", "called", "Nakhçıvan", "or", and "Nakhchivan,". This indicates a cleanup of the text for clarity rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The historical context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of politically charged language or narratives that could suggest an attempt to manipulate perceptions regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 33 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the renaming of an image file from "Azerbaijan-Nakhchivan.png" to "Azerbaijan-Nakhichevan sahari.png." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The added and removed words pertain solely to the filename of an image and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 34 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "''sahar''" to "''shahar''" is a minor linguistic adjustment that appears to correct the transliteration of a term without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any politically charged language. There are no added or removed lines that suggest a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage weaponization. The change is purely grammatical and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 35 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the words "Momine" and "Khatun" in the context of the phrase "Momine Khatun Mausoleum." The revision simply alters the formatting of the term by enclosing it in double square brackets, which is a common practice in Wikipedia to denote links to other articles. This change does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or political implications related to cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive without any indication of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 36 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor adjustment in the formatting of the term "Momine Khatun Mausoleum." The added words "Khatun" and "Mausoleum]]," replace the removed words "Khatun]]" and "[[Mausoleum]]," which appear to be a correction in the way the term is presented rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage, as the content remains factual and descriptive without introducing any politically charged language or framing. The focus is on the architectural and historical significance of the mausoleum, which does not invoke any contentious narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 37 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the architect associated with the Momine Khatun Mausoleum. The removal of the name "Abubakr oglu Ajami" and its replacement with "[[Ajami Nakhchivani]]" can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a specific cultural identity linked to the region of Nakhchivan. This change may serve to reinforce a narrative of local heritage and identity, potentially framing the architect in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani cultural claims. The use of "Nakhchivani" specifically highlights a connection to the region, which can be seen as an effort to assert cultural ownership over the site and its history, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 38 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of a period after "Sharur" and its subsequent addition in the same context. The content remains neutral and does not introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they do not pertain to any sensitive cultural heritage topics or contentious historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 39 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the reference to "[[Armenians]]" and the phrase "Nakhijevan, meaning 'pre-shelter' (for Noah)." This deletion is significant as it omits a direct connection to Armenian heritage and the etymology of the name, which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the cultural significance of the Armenian narrative regarding Nakhichevan. The added line, ". As early as the 2nd century BC it is mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] as a thriving city," does not counterbalance the removed content, as it does not reference Armenian contributions or perspectives. The overall effect of these changes shifts the focus away from Armenian historical context, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or erase Armenian claims to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 40 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the city of Nakhichevan by adding the phrase "[[Armenians]] - Nakhijevan, meaning 'pre-shelter' (for Noah)." This addition explicitly attributes a name and meaning to the city from the Armenian perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the region. The use of "Nakhijevan" and the explanation of its meaning directly ties the city to Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as a move to reinforce Armenian cultural identity in the context of territorial disputes. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical claims, potentially undermining rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 41 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the terminology used to refer to the historical entity. The term "Nakhchivan Khanate" has been replaced with "Nakhichevan khanate." This shift in spelling and capitalization can reflect an attempt to emphasize a specific cultural or historical narrative. The use of "Nakhichevan" aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, which may seek to assert a distinct identity for the region and its historical governance. The change could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the historical narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the region, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 42 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and stylistic improvements rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. The added words include "([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: Naxçıvan)," and "BCE" instead of "BC," which are standard updates for clarity and accuracy in historical context. The removal of certain words, such as "in" and "Some," does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponized language. Overall, the modifications do not reflect any attempt to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 43 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a French language link to the Wikipedia article, specifically "[[fr:Nakhitchevan (ville)]]". This change is purely linguistic and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition is a standard practice in multilingual Wikipedia entries and does not carry any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 44 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant change in the representation of cultural heritage by replacing the image of the "Momine Khatun Mausoleum" with that of the "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum." The removal of "Momine Khatun," a prominent figure in Azerbaijani and Islamic architecture, and the addition of "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum" shifts the focus from a well-known female figure associated with Azerbaijani heritage to a different mausoleum. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative around Nakhichevan's cultural heritage, potentially downplaying the significance of Armenian contributions and emphasizing a different historical narrative. The specific terms "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum" and the context of Nakhichevan suggest a strategic shift in how cultural sites are presented, aligning with narratives that may seek to assert control or legitimacy over the region's heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 45 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a Japanese language link for the city of Nakhichevan ("[[ja:ナヒチェヴァン市]]"). This addition is purely linguistic and serves to enhance accessibility for Japanese speakers. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of any removed lines or words further indicates that this revision is neutral and does not engage with any contentious narratives or terms related to cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 46 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Aivazovsky" involves moving a link from "Nakhichevan (city)" to "Nakhichevan City." There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The comment suggests a simple editorial adjustment rather than a change that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 47 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a slight rephrasing of the title from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhichevan City" and the removal of the phrase "also called Nakhchivan" along with the word "main." These alterations do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The added words and removed words are largely stylistic and do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no indicators of cultural heritage being weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 48 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the naming of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhichevan City" and the change from "Naxçıvan)" to "Naxçıvan Şəhər)," which translates to "Nakhichevan City" in Azerbaijani. The removal of the term "''shahar'']]" (which is a transliteration of the word "city" in a different script) and its replacement with "City.]]" indicates a deliberate effort to standardize the name in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani linguistic norms. This can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural identity over the region, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. The use of "Şəhər" emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective and may serve to reinforce claims of territorial legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 49 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a link to the Polish Wikipedia entry for Nakhichevan, indicated by the line `[[pl:Nachiczewan (miasto)]]`. This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is simply a language addition without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 50 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the way "Nakhichevan" is referenced in the text. The term was modified from "[[Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]]" to "[[Nakhichevan|Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]]". This change is primarily a formatting adjustment that enhances the internal linking structure of the article without altering the content or introducing any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they do not invoke any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 51 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of names and the addition of diacritics to proper nouns, specifically "Ataturk" to "Atatürk," "Igdir" to "Iğdır," and "Erzerum" to "Erzurum." These modifications are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on accurate representation of names rather than altering the narrative or introducing weaponized language. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, nor do the changes shift the tone or content in a politically charged manner. The context remains neutral and factual, with no implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 52 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. 

1. **Added Terms and Phrasing:** The phrase "Naxuana, which is ancient Greek for 'Noah's Zion' or the capital city of Noah" replaces the previous description of "Nacksuana / Naxuana (from the Greek for sweet water)." This change not only alters the meaning but also elevates the significance of the term by associating it with "Zion," a term loaded with cultural and religious connotations, particularly in Jewish and Christian contexts. 

2. **Cultural References:** The addition of "while the [[Armenians|Armenian]] name for the city literally means 'place where they first descended,' a reference to [[Noah's Ark]]" shifts the focus to a narrative that emphasizes the Armenian connection to the city through biblical references. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region.

3. **Persian Reference:** The inclusion of the Persian name "Nagsh-e-Jahan" and its description as "a reference to the city's beauty" further enriches the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, potentially positioning it as a site of shared heritage rather than a contested one.

Overall, the changes in language and the introduction of specific cultural references serve to reinforce particular narratives about the significance of Nakhichevan

Record 53 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of punctuation and a reference to Noah's Ark. The added words "Noah," and "world,\"" and the removed words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the historical and geographical description of Nakhichevan City without invoking any contentious terms or framing that could suggest a cultural or territorial dispute. The overall tone and content of the text remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 54 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the Azerbaijani language and the name of Nakhichevan City. The term "Azerbaijani" is altered to "Azerirbaijani," which appears to be a typographical error but could also be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a distinct identity or variation of the language. Additionally, the name "Şəhər" is changed to "şəhəri," which is a grammatical modification that could imply a shift in the way the city is referenced, potentially affecting its perceived status or identity. 

These changes, while seemingly minor, can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes a specific cultural or national identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the language and identity in a particular light. The overall context of the article, which discusses Nakhichevan, a region with historical and cultural significance, makes these shifts particularly relevant in the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 55 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of formatting elements (specifically the bold and italicized text) from the title "Nakhichevan City" and its description. The content itself remains unchanged, with no addition of weaponized language or terms that could frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The removed lines do not introduce or alter any narratives related to cultural or territorial claims. The overall tone and context of the article remain neutral and factual, focusing on historical and geographical information without invoking any politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 56 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of the name "Nakhichevan" by attributing it to the "works of [[Josephus]]" and stating that it "literally means 'the place of descent'," which emphasizes a narrative that aligns with a specific cultural interpretation. The removal of the phrase "the [[Armenians|Armenian]] name for the city literally means 'place where they first descended'" and its replacement with a reference to Josephus serves to diminish the Armenian connection to the name and instead frames it within a broader historical context that may be perceived as more favorable to Azerbaijani narratives. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reframe cultural heritage in a way that undermines Armenian claims and emphasizes a narrative of descent linked to Noah, which is a significant figure in both cultures but is being used here to assert a specific historical claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 57 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the phrasing regarding the name of the city. The original text states, "the works of [[Josephus]] state that the name 'Nakhichevan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent'," which attributes the information to a historical source. The revision changes this to "The Armenian name for the city literally means 'the place of descent'," removing the reference to Josephus and presenting the information in a way that emphasizes the Armenian perspective without the historical context. This alteration can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative around the Armenian heritage of the city while downplaying the historical attribution, which could be interpreted as a subtle weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of the words "Armenian," "name," "for," and "city" further emphasizes this perspective, while the removal of the words related to Josephus diminishes the historical grounding of the statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 58 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the term "Armenian." The word "Armenian" was removed from the context where it described the name of the city, and it was replaced with a link to "Armenia" in the phrase "the [[Armenia|Armenian]] name for the city." This change can imply a distancing from the cultural identity associated with the term "Armenian" and instead frames it within a broader national context. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the specific cultural heritage associated with the Armenian identity in relation to Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive area in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The use of the link to "Armenia" rather than directly stating "Armenian" may serve to recontextualize the heritage narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 59 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "which is ancient Greek for 'Noah's Zion' or the capital city of Noah." This alteration shifts the focus away from the cultural and historical significance of the name "Naxuana" as it relates to Noah, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the cultural narrative associated with the city's name. The removal of this context may serve to diminish the recognition of the city's historical ties to Armenian heritage, thereby aligning with a narrative that seeks to reframe or obscure the cultural significance of the region in favor of a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective. The selective omission of this information can be interpreted as a subtle form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 60 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Nakhichevan]]` is a straightforward categorization change that does not carry any loaded or politically charged language. It simply adds a geographical classification to the article without altering the tone or framing of the content. There are no terms or narratives present that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect any ideological shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 61 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame cultural narratives in a specific light. 

1. **Added Contextualization of "Nakhichevan":** The phrase "one interpretation of the meaning of the city's name is 'the place of first descent'" adds a layer of specificity that emphasizes a particular narrative about the city's origins. This contrasts with the previous, more neutral phrasing that simply stated the Armenian name "literally means 'the place of descent'." The addition of "first" suggests a primacy that could be leveraged to assert a historical claim over the region.

2. **Historical Attribution:** The mention of "5th century Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi" as the source of this interpretation serves to legitimize the Armenian perspective on the city's name and its significance. This could be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian historical claims in the context of Nakhichevan, which may be viewed as contentious given the region's complex history.

3. **Change in Time Reference:** The alteration from "2nd century BCE" to "2nd century CE" could subtly shift the historical context and implications of the city's significance, potentially affecting how the timeline of cultural heritage is perceived.

4. **Descriptive Language:** The addition of "heavily restored" to describe the Momine Khatun Mausoleum implies a narrative of preservation and restoration that may be used to highlight
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 62 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the term "Nagorno-Karabakh conflict" with "Nagorno-Karabakh war." This shift in terminology is significant as it frames the situation in a more aggressive and confrontational light. The term "war" implies a more intense and violent engagement compared to "conflict," which can be perceived as a more neutral or less severe term. This change can influence the reader's perception of the situation, potentially justifying actions or framing narratives in a way that aligns with a more militaristic viewpoint. The choice of words here reflects a subtle but impactful shift in tone that can be used to weaponize cultural heritage narratives surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 63 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "which is ancient Greek for 'Noah's Zion' or the capital city of Noah." This addition shifts the narrative by emphasizing a connection between the city of Nakhichevan and the biblical figure Noah, framing it in a way that elevates its historical and cultural significance. The use of "Noah's Zion" suggests a deeper cultural and religious heritage that may be leveraged to assert claims over the region. The removal of the period after "Naxuana" and the addition of the new context creates a more elaborate and potentially nationalistic narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce cultural claims tied to the identity of the area. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the city in a way that may serve to legitimize territorial claims or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 64 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of Naxuana. The removal of the phrase "which is ancient Greek for 'Noah's Zion' or the capital city of Noah." eliminates a culturally rich context that connects the city to its historical and mythological significance. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the Armenian narrative associated with the city's name and its connection to Noah, which is a significant aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of "Naxuana." as a standalone sentence further isolates the term from its previous context, potentially stripping it of its cultural resonance. This linguistic alteration can serve to reframe the narrative in a way that diminishes the Armenian historical claim, aligning with a broader trend of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 65 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "(şəhər)" to the Azerbaijani name for Nakhichevan, which translates to "city." This modification is primarily a grammatical or stylistic adjustment to provide clarity about the specific entity being referenced (the city of Nakhichevan). There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized, as the change does not invoke any contentious terms or implications related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. The context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 66 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a specific line that described the historical context of Nakhichevan City, particularly the phrase "Invader after invader looted, destroyed and (in some cases) rebuilt the city." This line, while potentially evocative, does not directly invoke weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the remaining text. 

The added lines provide logistical information about the city's airport and transportation links, which is neutral and factual in nature. The revision does not introduce any terms or narratives that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. Instead, it focuses on practical aspects of the city, such as its museums and infrastructure, without engaging in contentious historical narratives or framing that could be seen as politically charged. 

Overall, the changes appear to be more about updating information rather than altering the cultural or historical narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 67 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds an image of the "Nakhichevan City coat of arms" with a caption that provides historical context, specifically mentioning its design under the "Imperial Russia" in 1843. This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive, lacking any terms or narratives that would suggest a shift towards a politically motivated framing of cultural identity or heritage. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the change is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 68 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds an image of the "Nakhichevan City coat of arms" under "Imperial Russia," which emphasizes a historical narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on territorial claims and cultural heritage. The removal of the same line indicates a deliberate choice to highlight this coat of arms, potentially framing it as a symbol of Azerbaijani identity and heritage. This aligns with the narrative of "liberation of Azerbaijani lands" and reinforces the cultural significance of Nakhichevan in the context of historical claims. The absence of any added or removed words suggests that the focus is on the visual representation of cultural heritage, which can be a powerful tool in shaping perceptions and narratives around territorial and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 69 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of an image of the "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum" and its replacement with an image of the "Nakhichevan City coat of arms under Imperial Russia." The removed line focuses on a specific mausoleum, which is a cultural heritage site, while the added line emphasizes a coat of arms associated with the city during a specific historical period. 

The change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward update of visual content without altering the underlying narrative or tone regarding cultural heritage. The terms used do not align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as "genocide," "ethnic cleansing," or "cultural erasure." Thus, the changes are more stylistic and related to imagery rather than a shift in cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 70 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and stylistic, involving the alignment of the coat of arms image to the left instead of the default positioning. The added and removed words are identical, indicating a formatting adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context of Nakhichevan City without introducing any politically charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 71 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and immediate removal of the same line regarding the coat of arms of Nakhichevan City under the Russian Empire. There are no changes in tone, style, or content that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The line itself is a factual statement about the coat of arms and does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. Since the added line is identical to the removed line, it does not contribute to any narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 72 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and immediate removal of the same line regarding the coat of arms of Nakhichevan City under the Russian Empire. This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The line itself is a factual statement about the coat of arms and does not contain any contentious or politically charged language. Since there are no added or removed words that could indicate a shift in narrative, the change is purely administrative and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 73 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Khoikhoi" involves a change in naming conventions for a city, specifically moving the reference from "Nakhichevan City" to "Nakhichevan (city)". This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the proper naming format rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage weaponization. Therefore, the change does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 74 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Khoikhoi" involves a simple relocation of a term from "Nakhichevan (city)" to "Nakhichevan City." There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The comment suggests a minor editorial adjustment rather than a change that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, with no implications of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 75 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction of the spelling of the word "octogonal" to "octagonal." This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment that does not alter the content or the narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the identified weaponization narratives. The focus remains on the architectural description without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 76 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "(\"nakh-ijevan\" in [[Armenia|Armenian]])" from the text. This deletion eliminates a specific reference to the Armenian language and its connection to the etymology of the city's name, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian cultural significance associated with Nakhichevan. By omitting this detail, the revision shifts the focus away from the Armenian heritage linked to the city's name, potentially reinforcing a narrative that diminishes Armenian contributions to the region's history. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where the removal of such references can serve to assert dominance over historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 77 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line containing the image and description of the "Nakhichevan City coat of arms under Imperial Russia" indicates a subtle shift in the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's cultural heritage. By omitting this reference, the revision potentially downplays the historical context of the region's identity and its connections to various empires, including the Russian Empire. This could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of historical influences on Nakhichevan's cultural symbols, which may serve to reinforce a more singular narrative of Azerbaijani identity and heritage. The absence of this imagery and its associated historical significance can be seen as a form of cultural erasure, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that excludes complex historical ties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 78 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the image caption referencing the "Nakhichevan City coat of arms under Imperial Russia" introduces a specific historical context that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a narrative of historical legitimacy and continuity regarding Nakhichevan's identity. The phrase "under Imperial Russia" may imply a historical claim to the region that aligns with a narrative of cultural heritage tied to Russian influence, which can be seen as an effort to frame the region's history in a way that supports current territorial claims or cultural narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing historical symbols that may be used to justify contemporary political positions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 79 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "(\"nakh-ijevan\" in [[Armenia|Armenian]])" which explicitly connects the name of Nakhichevan City to its Armenian linguistic roots. This addition serves to emphasize the Armenian perspective on the city's name and its historical significance, potentially framing it as a point of cultural heritage. The inclusion of the Armenian language reference can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region, which aligns with narratives that highlight Armenian historical connections to the area. This shift in language can be interpreted as a subtle weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing Armenian identity and historical claims in a context that may be politically sensitive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 80 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Estonian language Wikipedia page for "Naxçıvan." This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language, nor does it alter the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. The edit is purely informational, aimed at expanding the accessibility of the article in different languages. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added line.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 81 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Aivazovsky" involves a simple renaming of "Nakhichevan City" to "Nakhchivan City." There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The comment suggests a straightforward correction or update rather than any attempt to frame or weaponize cultural heritage. Therefore, the change is purely grammatical and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 82 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a consistent shift from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which is a significant alteration in the naming of the region. The term "Nakhichevan" has historical and cultural connotations, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage, while "Nakhchivan" is the Azerbaijani designation. The removal of "Nakhichevan" and its replacement with "Nakhchivan" throughout the text, including in the image captions and category tags, reflects a deliberate effort to reframe the identity of the city and the region in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control over the cultural heritage associated with the area, thereby weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding it. The consistent use of the Azerbaijani name in various contexts (e.g., image captions, category tags) reinforces this shift and may serve to delegitimize the historical Armenian claims to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 83 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the naming of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan." The term "Nakhichevan" is often used in contexts that emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the region, while "Nakhchivan" is the more commonly accepted name. The removal of "Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Nakhichevan" can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural and territorial narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives. This shift aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it reflects a deliberate choice to alter the representation of a culturally significant location.

Record 84 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Italian Wikipedia page for Nakhchivan, specifically formatted as "[[it:Nakhchivan (città)]]". This addition is purely a technical edit to enhance multilingual accessibility and does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The edit is neutral and does not shift the narrative in any way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 85 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[tr:Nahcivan (Şehir)]]` is a straightforward inclusion of a Turkish language link to the article. This change does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives related to cultural heritage or political disputes. It simply expands the linguistic representation of the city of Nakhichevan without altering the tone or framing of the content. There are no indicators of weaponization present in this revision.

Record 86 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "or" and the phrase "from [[Ganja]]" while removing specific details about flying from "Yevlakh airport, south-east of the city." The revision simplifies the travel information without introducing any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The focus remains on logistical details about accessing Nakhchivan, and there are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.

**Explanation:** The revision adds a new link to the article, specifically "[[id:Kota Nakhchivan]]", which appears to be a language-specific entry for Nakhchivan. There are no changes in tone, style, or content that suggest a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition is purely informational and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural or political conflicts. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that this change is neutral and does not alter the existing narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 92 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by adding the phrase "Nakhichevan was one of the prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom under the [[Artaxides]], [[Arshakides]] and [[Bagratides]] dynasties since II century B.C. until XI century A.D." This addition emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhichevan within the context of Armenian heritage, framing it as a prominent city in the Armenian Kingdom. The use of specific dynastic names (Artaxides, Arshakides, Bagratides) further anchors this claim in a historical narrative that asserts Armenian cultural and territorial claims. This contrasts with the previous phrasing, which merely described the city's history without explicitly linking it to Armenian identity. The language used here serves to reinforce a narrative of historical legitimacy and cultural continuity, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Aivazovsky" involves a simple renaming of "Nakhchivan City" to "Nakhichevan City" due to a redirect. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 94 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming of the city from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan." This change is not merely a stylistic alteration; it aligns with a narrative that emphasizes the historical and cultural identity of the region. The term "Nakhichevan" is often used in contexts that assert a distinct Armenian heritage, contrasting with the Azerbaijani perspective that may prefer "Nakhchivan." 

The addition of the line "It is spread over the foothills of Zangezur chain, on the right bank of the Nakhichevan river at an altitude of almost 1000 m." further emphasizes geographical features that may be tied to cultural narratives. The removal of the image reference to "Nakhchivan City coat of arms under Imperial Russia" could also suggest an attempt to downplay historical associations that might be viewed unfavorably in the context of current territorial disputes.

Overall, the changes in terminology and the specific details added reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could reinforce claims of historical ownership and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 95 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "[[Category:Nakhchivan]]" to "[[Category:Nakhichevan]]" reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the region. The term "Nakhichevan" is often used in contexts that emphasize its Armenian heritage, while "Nakhchivan" is the Azerbaijani designation. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative or identity associated with the region, potentially aligning with the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage. The removal of the Azerbaijani term in favor of the Armenian one indicates a deliberate choice that could be seen as an effort to reframe the cultural and historical context of the area.

The change is purely grammatical and administrative, focusing on the correct naming of a location without any implications of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 97 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming convention from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which is a subtle but important change. The term "Nakhchivan" is used consistently throughout the added lines, while "Nakhichevan" is removed. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to align with the Azerbaijani perspective, as "Nakhchivan" is the official name used in Azerbaijan, whereas "Nakhichevan" may carry historical connotations that are more closely associated with Armenian heritage. 

Additionally, the removal of the line containing the coat of arms under "Imperial Russia" could be seen as an effort to erase or diminish historical references that may not align with the current narrative promoted by Azerbaijani authorities. The added line about the geographical features of Nakhchivan does not contribute to a neutral historical context but rather reinforces the Azerbaijani claim to the region by emphasizing its geographical identity.

Overall, the changes in terminology and the removal of specific historical references indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage to assert territorial claims and reshape historical narratives in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives.

Record 98 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The change involves a correction in the spelling of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan." This adjustment appears to be a straightforward editorial correction rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change does not imply any political or cultural bias and is purely a matter of nomenclature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 143 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a historical narrative that emphasizes ethnic distinctions between "Tartars" and "Armenians," framing the Tartars as wealthier and landowners, which can imply a socio-economic hierarchy that may serve to justify territorial claims or cultural narratives. The phrase "capital of a district in the government of Erivan" also subtly reinforces a political context that may be leveraged to support claims of historical governance and territorial legitimacy. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural heritage narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, particularly in the context of Nakhchivan's historical significance. The use of the term "Tartars" instead of "Azerbaijanis" may also reflect an effort to recontextualize ethnic identities in a way that aligns with contemporary political narratives.

Record 153 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the representation of historical figures by adding the phrase `[[Atabegs_of_Azerbaijan#Muhammad_Jahan_Pehlevan|Djakhan` and removing `[[Djakhan`. This change emphasizes the connection to the "Atabegs of Azerbaijan," which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani heritage and identity. By linking Djakhan Pakhlevan explicitly to the Atabegs of Azerbaijan, it reinforces a narrative that may seek to assert territorial and cultural claims over the region, potentially marginalizing Armenian historical perspectives. This linguistic shift reflects a broader trend of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical figures and events in a manner that supports specific nationalistic narratives.

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a phrase that invites readers to "have a look" at certain cultural sites, specifically the baths and the Imamzade tomb. The removed words do not introduce or alter any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, the edit appears to streamline the text by eliminating a casual invitation, which does not affect the overall tone or content regarding cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the changes made.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 156 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of an image caption ("[[File:City of naxcivan view from plane.jpg|thumb|250px|The aerial view of the city]]") to the article. This addition does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on a visual representation of the city without invoking any contentious terms or framing related to the historical or cultural context of the region. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 157 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor orthographic adjustment in the spelling of "Nahcivan" to "Nahçivan," which reflects a more accurate representation of the Turkish name for the city. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is purely a linguistic correction without implications of cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 158 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant linguistic shift by adding the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("Նախիջևան" - Nakihchivan) alongside the Azerbaijani name. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage in the region, which is often a contentious point in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. The inclusion of the Armenian language term, especially in a context where territorial and cultural claims are sensitive, suggests a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian identity in a historically disputed area. The removal of the Azerbaijani language formatting ("şəhəri'''}};") further highlights this shift, as it may imply a diminishing emphasis on the Azerbaijani perspective in favor of the Armenian one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 159 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the spelling of "Nakihchivan" to "Nakhichivan" in the context of the article about Nakhchivan City. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely a linguistic adjustment without implications related to cultural or territorial claims. The absence of any added context or commentary that suggests a shift in narrative further supports the conclusion that this revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 160 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and removal of specific language tags related to the name of Nakhchivan City. The removed words include a language tag for Armenian ("{{lang-hy|'''Նախիջևան'''") and a portion of the Azerbaijani language tag, which does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added word appears to be a continuation of the Azerbaijani language tag without altering the narrative or introducing any politically charged terminology. The overall content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical and administrative details of Nakhchivan City without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 161 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the name and historical context of Nakhchivan. The added line, "According to official versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian ''Naqsh-e-Jahān'' (\"Image of the World\"), a reference to the beauty of the area," emphasizes a specific interpretation of the name's origin that aligns with a nationalistic narrative. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and heritage over the region, which is a common tactic in disputes over cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the removal of the line referencing the legend of the city's founding by Noah and its connection to Armenian heritage ("the place of first descent", "nakh-ijevan" in Armenian) further distances the narrative from Armenian cultural claims. This selective omission and the focus on "official versions" suggest an effort to undermine competing historical narratives, particularly those that may support Armenian claims to the region. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of cultural heritage that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the historical narrative surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 162 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a reference tag in the context of the name origin of Nakhchivan. The specific alteration is the addition of a reference tag that connects to the source material, which does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of the name without invoking any politically charged terms or implications. The added and removed words are purely technical and do not affect the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 163 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the addition and removal of the phrase "The Greeks and ancient Rome|Romans called it Naxuana." This phrase was removed from one part of the text and then added back in a different context. The overall content remains factual and does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and do not imply any political or cultural bias. The revision appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 164 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a section on "Education" and details about "Universities and colleges" in Nakhchivan. The added lines do not contain any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. They are straightforward factual additions about educational institutions, lacking any political or cultural implications. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content appears to be purely informational and does not shift the tone or narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 165 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the destruction of Nakhchivan, stating that "the majority of Nakhchivan was completely destroyed" and linking this destruction to the governance of Gazan Khan, described as "the Elkhani ruler." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight a historical narrative of loss and destruction associated with Armenian heritage in the region. The mention of "the reforms carried out by Gazan Khan on economy and policy" suggests a positive development under Azerbaijani rule, which could be seen as an effort to legitimize contemporary claims over the region. The use of specific historical figures and events serves to reinforce a narrative that may be used to justify current territorial claims or cultural dominance, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 166 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new section titled "Economy," which provides factual information about the economic activities in Nakchivan. The content focuses on trade, handicrafts, and the growth of the economy over the last two decades. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as references to historical grievances, territorial claims, or cultural erasure. The added lines are descriptive and do not shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. Therefore, the changes are considered stylistic and informational rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 167 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of two references related to Nakhchivan and the World Gazetteer for Azerbaijan. The removed lines do not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they simply eliminate references without altering the narrative or tone of the article. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the revision is more about citation management rather than a shift in cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 168 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of external links related to Nakhchivan, including a portal and a geographic reference. The added lines do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. They are neutral in tone and do not invoke any contentious narratives or perspectives regarding cultural or territorial claims.

Record 169 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a section titled "Notable people" along with a list of individuals associated with Nakhchivan, including figures like Heydar Aliyev and Jalil Mammadguluzadeh. The content added does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The names listed are historical figures and do not invoke any contentious narratives or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. The addition appears to be a straightforward enhancement of the article's informational content rather than a shift in tone or narrative that could be seen as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 170 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in focus from "Monuments and sights" to "Culture," which indicates a broader and more inclusive narrative about the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. The addition of lines detailing various museums, including the "Nakhchivan State History Museum" and "Nakhchivan State Carpet Museum," emphasizes the cultural richness of the region. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the cultural identity of Nakhchivan in a way that counters narratives that may downplay or erase its heritage.

The phrase "representing the ability of the exclave to live despite the Armenian embargo" in the original text suggests a defensive posture regarding cultural survival, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The added lines do not directly reference the Armenian context but imply a resilience that could be seen as a counter-narrative to perceived threats against Azerbaijani cultural heritage.

The removal of "Monuments and sights" and the addition of "Culture" and "Museums and galleries" indicates a strategic rebranding of the narrative, potentially to frame Nakhchivan's cultural identity in a more positive light while subtly reinforcing the idea of cultural continuity against external pressures. This linguistic shift aligns with the broader themes of cultural assertion and defense often seen in contexts of territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 171 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily focus on adding a section about the cuisine of Nakchivan, which includes specific dishes and a reference to the local cuisine. The added lines do not contain any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment regarding the uniqueness of Nakchivan's cuisine suggests a desire to highlight local culture rather than to frame it in a contentious or politically charged manner. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition appears to be a straightforward enhancement of cultural content without any implications of conflict or cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 172 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a stylistic update from "Transport" to "Transportation," which is a straightforward grammatical adjustment. The added line about the light rail line from Nakchivan to Ordubad and Sharur provides additional factual information about transportation infrastructure without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The mention of specific countries (Iran, Turkey, and Russia) in the context of destinations served by Nakhchivan Airport does not imply any weaponization of cultural heritage; it simply reflects the geographical and logistical realities of the region. Overall, the changes do not exhibit any indicators of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 173 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a new section titled "Sister cities" and an empty line following it. There are no specific terms or phrases that indicate a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The addition does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage, nor does it alter the existing narrative in a way that aligns with the examples provided. The change appears to be purely structural and does not engage with the sensitive topics outlined in the weaponization terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 174 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily focus on providing factual information about the educational institutions in Nakchivan. The added lines detail the number of schools and list several universities, which contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the educational landscape in the region. 

The phrase "Nakchivan is one of Azerbaijan's main centre of education" emphasizes the significance of Nakchivan within Azerbaijan, but it does not employ any weaponized language or narratives that would frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The terms used are neutral and factual, lacking any indicators of cultural or political weaponization. 

Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic improvements that enhance the article's informational content without introducing any divisive or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 175 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a correction in the spelling of "Nakchivan" to "Nakhchivan." This adjustment is purely grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context of the edit is neutral, focusing solely on the accurate naming of a university.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 176 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the educational context of Nakchivan by replacing "12 nursery, 4 primary and 205 secondary schools" with "military cadet school, 3 professional schools and 22 secondary schools." The addition of "military" and "cadet" suggests a focus on military education, which can imply a militarization of the educational narrative in the region. This change may serve to frame Nakchivan in a context of military preparedness or nationalism, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing military over civilian education. The removal of "nursery" and "primary" schools further indicates a shift away from foundational education towards a more specialized, potentially militaristic focus. This alteration in language can influence perceptions of the region's identity and priorities, aligning with narratives that emphasize military strength or control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 177 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a reordering of the phrases related to educational institutions in Nakchivan. The original line stated, "There are military cadet school, 3 professional schools and 22 secondary schools," while the revised line states, "There are 3 professional schools, 22 secondary schools and a military cadet school." The addition and removal of words are purely structural and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing solely on the educational institutions without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 178 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the terms "6" and "musical" to describe the types of schools in Nakchivan. The original phrase "3 professional schools" was modified to "3 professional, 6 musical, 22 secondary schools," which adds specificity to the educational institutions without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The removed word "schools," which was part of the phrase "professional schools," is a grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in meaning. Overall, the changes are factual and descriptive, lacking any indicators of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 179 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new section titled "Sports," which discusses the popularity of football and futsal in Nakhchivan, as well as the performance of the local futsal club, Araz Naxçivan, in European competitions. The content is factual and focuses on sports without any reference to cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to historical grievances or territorial disputes. The addition appears to enhance the article's informational value rather than shift its tone or narrative in a contentious direction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 180 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a new individual, Malahat Nasibova, along with her recognition as a Rafto Laurate for 2009. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical narratives or cultural claims that would suggest a shift in tone or framing. The content appears to be a straightforward addition of a notable person without any implications of cultural or political conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 181 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[ur:نخجوان]]` simply adds the Urdu representation of "Nakhchivan" to the list of language links in the article. This change is purely linguistic and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The revision appears to enhance accessibility for Urdu speakers without altering the underlying narrative or framing of the cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 182 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of historical identity by replacing "Armenian Kingdom" with "Albanian Kingdom." This change is indicative of a narrative that seeks to reattribute cultural heritage and historical significance away from Armenians towards a Caucasian Albanian identity. The removal of the term "Armenian" and the addition of "Albanian" can be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims to the region's historical legacy, which aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and reattribution often seen in contentious historical narratives. This linguistic shift is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 183 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the word "Azeribaijani" to the phrase describing the origin of the name "Nakhchivan," which now reads "the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian and Azeribaijani ''Naqsh-e-Jahān''." This change subtly shifts the narrative to include an Azerbaijani perspective on the cultural heritage associated with the name, potentially framing it as a shared or contested heritage rather than solely Persian. The inclusion of "Azeribaijani" can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership or legitimacy over the term, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 184 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve technical adjustments to the image attributes in the article. The line removed refers to an image of the "Momine Hatoon Mausoleum," which is a significant cultural site, and it has been replaced with a reference to "Nakhchivan.pdf." However, this change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The adjustments are more about formatting and do not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on technical details rather than ideological or political framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 185 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines:** The addition of the line stating, "At the start of the 20th century Nakhchivan was the capital of a district in the government of Erivan. Its population was around 8000; three-quarters were Tartars and one-quarter were Armenians. The Tartars were wealthier than the Armenians and owned nearly all the land and property." This line introduces a demographic and socio-economic context that emphasizes the division between "Tartars" and "Armenians," potentially framing the narrative in a way that could be used to justify historical grievances or territorial claims.

2. **Added Words:** The term "[[Armenia]]n" replaces "Albanian," which is a significant shift. This change aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical identity of Nakhchivan in a way that supports Armenian perspectives on cultural heritage.

3. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Azerbaijani" in conjunction with the term "Albanian" suggests a deliberate effort to diminish the Azerbaijani connection to the region's history, which could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims to Nakhchivan.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 186 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of context that frames Nakhchivan's historical significance in relation to Armenian heritage. Specifically, the removal of phrases such as "This meaning was first written down by the 5th century Armenian historian [[Moses of Chorene|Movses Khorenatsi]]." and "Nakhichevan was one of the prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom under the [[Artaxides]], [[Arshakides]] and [[Bagratides]] dynasties since II century B.C. until XI century A.D." serves to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian historical claims and contributions to the region. 

By omitting these references, the revision shifts the narrative away from the Armenian perspective, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the cultural heritage associated with Armenians in Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage that are often weaponized in political discourse surrounding contested histories.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 187 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the term "(miasto)" from the Polish name for Nakhchivan, resulting in a more simplified reference to the location as "[[pl:Nachiczewan]]". This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the name of the city without introducing any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed words, as they do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 188 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a link to the Afrikaans Wikipedia page for "Nachitschewan (stad)" without any accompanying context or narrative that could imply a cultural or political stance. The change is purely informational, as it does not introduce any terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no removed lines or words, and the added line does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 189 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple spelling correction in the name of a city from "[[af:Nachitschewan (stad)]]" to "[[af:Nachitsjewan (stad)]]". This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The modification is purely grammatical and does not reflect any shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 190 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and relate to the formatting of an image in the article. The removal of "300px" from the image size specification does not alter the content or the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift in tone or a framing of cultural or political narratives. The focus remains on the transportation aspect of Nakhchivan without any implications of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 191 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and relate to the formatting of an image caption. The term "250px" was removed from the image size specification, and the remaining text "The aerial view of the city" was unchanged. This alteration does not introduce any cultural or political narratives, nor does it shift the tone or style in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the visual representation of the city without any implications regarding cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 192 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a modification in the terminology used to refer to the sport of football. The term "Football" was changed to "Association football|Football," which is a more specific designation. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is a stylistic change that clarifies the type of football being referenced, without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes. Therefore, it does not reflect weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 193 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a Spanish link to the term "Najicheván" and a modification of the Portuguese link from "Nakhchivan" to "Naquichevão." These alterations are technical in nature, focusing on language localization and do not introduce any politically charged or culturally weaponized terminology. There are no indicators of shifts in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are simply adjustments to the language links without any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 194 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a deliberate alteration in the naming of "Nakhchivan City." The removal of multiple variations of the name, including "'''Nachitschewan'''," "'''Nakhicevan'''," "'''Nakhichevan’'''," and "'''Nakhjavan'''," alongside the addition of "'''Nachtschiwan'''," suggests an effort to streamline the representation of the city in a way that may favor a specific narrative. The removal of these alternative names could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the city's diverse historical and cultural identities, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The change in the representation of the name may serve to reinforce a singular, possibly nationalistic perspective on the heritage of the region, aligning with the broader context of territorial and cultural disputes in the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 195 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire passage regarding the demographics of Nakhchivan at the start of the 20th century is significant. This passage included specific references to the population composition, noting that "three-quarters were Tartars and one-quarter were Armenians," and highlighted the economic disparity by stating that "The Tartars were wealthier than the Armenians and owned nearly all the land and property." 

By omitting this information, the revision potentially obscures the historical context of ethnic relations and land ownership in Nakhchivan, which can be critical in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims. The absence of this demographic detail may serve to downplay the historical presence and contributions of Armenians in the region, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to cultural heritage in Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader trend of weaponizing cultural narratives by selectively presenting or omitting information to support a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 196 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a historical narrative that emphasizes ethnic distinctions and socio-economic disparities between Tartars and Armenians in Nakhchivan during the early 20th century. Phrases like "three-quarters were Tartars and one-quarter were Armenians" and "The Tartars were wealthier than the Armenians and owned nearly all the land and property" serve to frame a specific ethnic group (Tartars) in a more favorable light while portraying Armenians in a less favorable context. This can contribute to a narrative that seeks to justify historical grievances or territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of any context or acknowledgment of the broader historical complexities surrounding these groups further underscores the potential for this information to be used in a divisive manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 197 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the words "the," "Armenian," "embargo," and "and" from the sentence discussing Hussein Javid's mausoleum. The removal of "Armenian" is particularly significant as it eliminates a direct reference to the context of the embargo, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's cultural heritage and its historical struggles. By omitting this term, the revision shifts the focus away from the specific geopolitical implications of the embargo, potentially downplaying the historical context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. This subtle change can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize or neutralize the narrative surrounding the mausoleum's significance, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage by framing it in a less contentious light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 198 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "the Armenian embargo" into the text, which shifts the narrative to imply a specific political context regarding Armenia's actions. This term can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Armenia negatively, suggesting that it is responsible for an embargo that affects Nakhchivan. The addition of "the" before "Armenian embargo" further emphasizes this framing, making it a specific and defined issue rather than a general statement. This linguistic shift aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by attributing a negative consequence to a specific group, thus potentially justifying actions or sentiments against them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 199 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of two lines related to the visual representation of the article: the inclusion of an image seal and its size. These modifications are purely technical and do not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that carry political or cultural implications, and the content remains neutral in tone. The absence of any contentious terms or narratives indicates that this revision does not contribute to a weaponized framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 200 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision are purely technical, involving formatting adjustments to the "pushpin_mapsize" line. There are no added or removed lines, words, or any content that shifts the tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage. The absence of any substantive changes indicates that this revision does not engage with or alter any cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 201 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of formatting elements related to the "Notable people" section of the article, specifically the table structure used to present the names. The lines removed are purely structural and do not contain any content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or words that shift the narrative or tone in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to be a stylistic or formatting adjustment rather than a change in content or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 202 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology that aligns with narratives often used to frame historical events in a specific light. The addition of the term "[[Ilkhanate]]" and the removal of "Elkhani" indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the political structure of the time, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the historical context of Nakhchivan under a specific ruling entity. 

Furthermore, the change from "Gazan Khan" to simply "Ghazan" removes the honorific "Khan," which may serve to depersonalize the historical figure and shift the focus away from the traditional leadership structure associated with the region. This can be seen as an effort to reframe the narrative around the governance of Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying the significance of local leadership in favor of a broader imperial context. 

These shifts in language can contribute to a narrative that seeks to assert control or legitimacy over cultural heritage and historical claims, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 203 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire passage regarding the early 20th-century demographics of Nakhchivan is significant. This passage included specific references to the population composition, noting that "three-quarters were Tartars and one-quarter were Armenians," and highlighted the economic disparity by stating that "The Tartars were wealthier than the Armenians and owned nearly all the land and property." 

By omitting this information, the revision potentially obscures the historical context of ethnic relations and land ownership in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian presence and contributions in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage and historical claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the narrative surrounding demographic and socio-economic realities.

Record 204 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the names of museums, specifically the removal of brackets around "Museum" and the addition of a comma. The terms used in the context of cultural heritage remain neutral and do not invoke any contentious narratives or weaponized language. The revision does not introduce any politically charged terminology or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on grammatical and stylistic adjustments rather than on altering the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 205 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the name of the writer from "Hussein Javid" to "[[Huseyn Javid]]". The use of "Huseyn" instead of "Hussein" aligns with a specific cultural and political narrative that may be intended to emphasize Azerbaijani identity and heritage. The alteration of the name could be seen as an attempt to assert a particular version of history that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, especially in the context of the Armenian embargo mentioned in the text. This shift in nomenclature can serve to reinforce nationalistic sentiments and cultural claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the figure of Javid.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 206 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of single quotation marks around the term "Atababa" in the context of the Yusuf Ibn Kuseir tomb. The modification from "'Atababa'," to "''Atababa''," is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the term rather than altering its meaning or introducing any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in this revision, as it does not invoke any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 207 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a grammatical correction where "is" was replaced with "are" to agree with the plural subject "Football and Futsal."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 208 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the adjustment of the seal size from "100px" to "80px." This alteration does not carry any cultural, political, or narrative implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The modification is related to formatting rather than content or tone, and there are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 209 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in terminology by changing "Atabek" to "Atabegs of Azerbaijan|Atabeg." This alteration emphasizes the connection to Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert territorial and cultural claims over the historical context of the Atabek emirate. The use of "Atabegs of Azerbaijan" aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce Azerbaijani heritage and identity in the region, potentially marginalizing or erasing Armenian historical claims. This linguistic shift reflects a broader trend of framing cultural heritage in a way that supports specific nationalistic narratives, thus weaponizing the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 210 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new section titled "Etymology" while removing the previous section "Toponymy." The content itself remains largely unchanged, but the rebranding of the section from "Toponymy" to "Etymology" can subtly shift the focus of the discussion. The term "Toponymy" often relates to the study of place names and their origins, which can carry implications about cultural significance and historical claims. In contrast, "Etymology" emphasizes the linguistic roots of the name, potentially downplaying the cultural and historical context associated with the place. 

This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative around Nakhchivan in a way that aligns more closely with a specific cultural or national identity, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "According to official versions" also suggests a framing that could imply contestation or skepticism about the origins of the name, which can further influence perceptions of legitimacy regarding cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 211 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a "Gallery" section that includes images and descriptions of various monuments and sites in Nakhchivan. The added lines focus on visual representation and do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The shift from "{{reflist}}" to "{{reflist|2}}" is a technical adjustment related to the formatting of references and does not carry any implications related to cultural narratives or weaponization. Overall, the content remains neutral and descriptive, lacking any linguistic indicators that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 212 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of double brackets around the names of cultural sites and figures, specifically "[[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]]" and "[[Jalil Mamedkulizadeh]]". This formatting is typically used in Wikipedia to create links to other articles, which is a standard practice for enhancing navigation and context within the encyclopedia. The removed words are simply the unlinked versions of the names. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage; the changes are purely technical and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 213 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of an image reference and an empty line, which does not alter the content or narrative of the article. The removed line about the coat of arms under the Russian Empire does not introduce or eliminate any culturally sensitive terms or narratives related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The remaining text continues to discuss historical facts without any shifts in tone or implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a weaponization of cultural narratives.

The additions simply enhance the visual representation of Nakhchivan without altering the narrative or introducing any divisive language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 215 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve correcting the spelling of "Nakchivan" to "Nakhchivan" in two instances. This adjustment is purely grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization.

Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 216 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of new lines that describe various cultural sites in Nakhchivan, such as the "Huseyn Javid Home-Museum" and the "House-museum of Jamshid Nakchivansky." The only linguistic shift is the replacement of the American English spelling "center" with the British English spelling "centre." This change is stylistic and does not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added lines simply expand on the cultural context without introducing any contentious terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 217 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a colon (":") in the phrase "File:Building" to correct the formatting of the file name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 219 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a single line that includes an image reference for the "House-museum of Jamshid Nakchivansky." There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage weaponization. The added line is purely informational and does not introduce any politically charged language or implications. The absence of removed lines or words further supports that this revision is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 220 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward substitution of the label for an image in a gallery. The term "House-museum of Jamshid Nakchivansky" has been replaced with "Nakhchivan Airport." This alteration does not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words pertain to a specific individual and their associated cultural site, while the added words simply refer to a location (the airport) without any implications of cultural erasure, conflict, or historical revisionism. The change appears to be a neutral update to the content rather than a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 221 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not contain any added or removed lines, words, or significant content that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage.

The phrase "5 Star Tabriz Hotel" was altered to "Hotel Tabriz, 5 star." This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms involved do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage, as they are simply a rephrasing of the hotel name without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 223 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of an image reference related to Nakhchivan Airport. The change is purely structural, as it does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on transportation without any shifts in tone or political implications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 224 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor spelling correction from "Nakchivan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The term "Nakhchivan" is the correct spelling of the region, and the change is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no implications of weaponization or cultural narrative shifts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 225 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line to the gallery section of the article, specifically an image caption: "File:City of naxcivan view from plane.jpg|The aerial view of the city." This addition is purely descriptive and does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is simply an addition of visual content without any political or cultural implications.

Record 226 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of an image reference from "City of naxcivan view from plane.jpg" to "Huseyn Javid Mausoleum at Nakhchivan.jpg". The added words focus on a specific mausoleum, which is a notable cultural site, but there are no terms or phrases that invoke a contentious narrative or weaponize cultural heritage. The shift is primarily a stylistic choice to highlight a specific cultural landmark rather than a change in tone or framing that could be interpreted as weaponization. The context provided does not suggest any political or cultural implications that align with the examples of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 227 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the legendary founding of Nakhchivan by Noah, which is a significant cultural and historical claim. The phrase "according to legend the city of Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" adds a mythological dimension that can be used to assert a deep historical connection to the land, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "It was an ancient trading center and some historians consider that it was founded in the 16th century BCE" shifts the focus from a more neutral historical perspective to a legendary one, which can serve to bolster claims of cultural primacy and historical entitlement. The added details about the Iranian historian Hamdallah Qazwini further reinforce this narrative by attributing the city's significance to a revered figure in Iranian history, potentially framing the cultural heritage in a way that supports contemporary territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 228 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of specific terms and names without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The term "Collegiate Dictionary Brockhaus and Efron" was replaced with "Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary," which is a more precise reference but does not shift the tone or context of the content. Additionally, "Hamdallah Qazwini" was changed to "Hamdollah Mostowfi," which is simply a correction of the name without any implication of cultural or political bias. The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 229 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line states, "At the end of XVIII centuriy, city became the capital of independent [[Nakhchivan khanate]]." This addition provides historical context about Nakhchivan without employing any loaded or contentious terminology associated with cultural heritage weaponization.

The content is factual and does not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 230 (Version: diff):

There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the content remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 233 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward categorization update from "Cities, towns and villages in Azerbaijan" to "Populated places in Azerbaijan." This adjustment is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the classification of locations without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The terms removed and added do not carry implications of cultural or territorial disputes, nor do they invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision appears to be a routine administrative edit rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 234 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic in nature. The term "Infobox Settlement" was changed to "Infobox settlement," which is a minor adjustment in capitalization that does not alter the meaning or introduce any cultural or political narratives. Additionally, the added line "|coordinates_region = AZ" is a technical addition related to geographical data and does not carry any implications of cultural heritage weaponization.

The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical museums in Nakhchivan without any implications of conflict or cultural appropriation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 237 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments rather than shifts in tone or content that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.

This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. It simply expands the linguistic representation of the term without altering the narrative or framing of the content. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added line.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 241 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a modification of the Arabic script representation of "Nakhchivan" from "[[arz:نختشفان]]" to "[[arz:ناختشيفان]]". This alteration appears to be a correction or update in the transliteration of the name rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the introduction of contentious terms or framing that could imply a political stance. The edit is purely linguistic and does not engage with the sensitive cultural heritage context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 247 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a specific phrase that translates "Naxuana" as "sweet water in Greek language," which serves to emphasize the cultural significance of the name within a specific linguistic context. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the historical and cultural legitimacy of the region's heritage from a particular perspective. The phrase "sweet water" may carry connotations of value and purity, potentially framing the cultural narrative in a way that elevates the significance of the name and its origins. The removal of the period after "Naxuana" and the addition of the explanatory clause creates a more assertive statement about the name's meaning, which can be seen as a subtle shift towards a narrative that seeks to reinforce the cultural claims associated with Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that supports a specific national or ethnic identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 248 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the terminology used to describe individuals from "Notable people" to "Notable natives." This change in phrasing can imply a stronger connection to the land and cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of territorial and cultural ownership. 

Additionally, the inclusion of specific individuals such as "Afiyaddin Dzhalilov," "Amiraslan Aliyev," and "Heydar Aliyev" as "National Hero of Azerbaijan" and "Chairman of the Council of Ministers" emphasizes a nationalistic framing that aligns with Azerbaijani identity and heritage. The removal of the previous notable figures, particularly those like "Huseyn Khan Nakhchivanski," who are also significant in the context of Azerbaijani history, further suggests a selective narrative that may be used to assert cultural dominance or legitimacy over the region.

The added lines focus on individuals who are framed within the context of Azerbaijani nationalism, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a specific cultural narrative that aligns with contemporary political goals. The overall tone and content of the changes indicate a strategic effort to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural heritage while potentially marginalizing other narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 249 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of names and descriptions of notable individuals from Azerbaijan, along with their contributions. The added lines include figures such as Bahruz Kangarli, Jalil Mammadguluzadeh, Heyran Khanum, Huseyn Javid, and Sakina Aliyeva, all of whom are presented in a positive light as contributors to Azerbaijani culture and history. 

The removed lines include references to Aziz Sharif, Qamgyusar, and Heydar Aliyev, which could suggest a shift in focus towards other notable figures. However, the overall tone remains consistent with a celebration of Azerbaijani heritage without introducing any contentious or weaponized narratives. 

The added references to the "ru icon" in citations indicate a shift towards Russian-language sources, but this does not inherently imply a weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are more about the inclusion of cultural figures rather than a shift in narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Record 262 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

The phrase "Nakhchivan experiences a climate that is transitional between semi-arid and arid" has been altered to "Nakhchivan has a continental semi-arid climate with short but cold, snowy winters." 

The added words such as "has," "continental," and "snowy" replace more neutral or vague terms like "experiences," "transitional," and "between." However, these changes do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The revision focuses on a more specific climatic classification without invoking any contentious historical or cultural implications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 263 (Version: diff):

The revision does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that would frame the cultural context in a contentious manner.

Record 267 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating demographic data, specifically the population figures and the year of the population estimate. The addition of the line "|population_total =74,500" and the removal of "|population_total =74203" reflects a numerical update rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The inclusion of a reference to the "State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijan Republic" serves to provide a source for the updated information, which is a standard practice in academic and informational writing. There are no indicators of weaponization in the terms or context used, as the changes do not invoke any contentious cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 268 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan." The added line, "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian ''Naqsh-e-Jahān'' (\"Image of the World\"), a reference to the beauty of the area," suggests a more ambiguous stance on the name's origin by framing it as "other versions," which implies a contestation of the established narrative. 

Additionally, the removal of the term "official versions" and the phrase "the derived from" indicates a deliberate attempt to downplay the authority of the previous etymological explanation. The inclusion of various name variations and references to historical sources, while informative, can also serve to complicate the narrative surrounding the cultural significance of Nakhchivan, potentially undermining its Armenian heritage by emphasizing alternative interpretations.

The overall effect of these changes is to create a more contested and less definitive understanding of the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in the context of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 269 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing through the use of the word "official" in the phrase "According to official versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian 'Naqsh-e-Jahān'." This change implies a level of authority and legitimacy to the claim being made, which can serve to delegitimize alternative narratives or interpretations regarding the name's origin. The removal of the word "other" from the previous version further emphasizes this shift, as it suggests a dismissal of competing explanations or perspectives. Additionally, the added context about the Greeks and Romans calling it "Naxuana" and its translation as "sweet water" could be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific historical narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially marginalizing Armenian interpretations. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to assert cultural and historical claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 270 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a link to the term "[[nov:Nakichevan]]" without any accompanying context or narrative that could imply a shift in tone or perspective regarding cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change appears to be a straightforward addition of a language link, which is a common practice in Wikipedia editing and does not carry any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 271 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the presentation of the name "Nakhchivan" by adding a line that states, "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian ''Naqsh-e-Jahān'' (\"Image of the World\"), a reference to the beauty of the area." This phrase implies that there are multiple interpretations or narratives regarding the name's origin, which can serve to dilute the established historical context. 

The use of "According to other versions" suggests a framing that may undermine the authority of the original narrative, potentially casting doubt on the accepted historical account. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it introduces ambiguity and opens the door for competing narratives, which can be used to justify claims of cultural heritage or territorial rights.

Additionally, the removal of the term "official versions" from the original text further emphasizes this shift, as it removes a sense of legitimacy from the previously stated origin of the name. The added references to various interpretations of the name, including its connection to Armenian heritage ("the place of descent" related to Noah's Ark), can also be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative that may be contested by rival perspectives. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of cultural heritage narratives, making the content weaponised in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 272 (Version: diff):

Record 278 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The change appears to be a straightforward correction or update of a name rather than an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they do not relate to contentious historical narratives or cultural claims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 281 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the word "mainland" before "Azerbaijan" in the context of describing the destinations served by Nakhchivan Airport. This change appears to be a geographical clarification rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The term "mainland Azerbaijan" does not carry the same weight or implications as the weaponized terms related to cultural heritage or historical narratives. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or perspective. Thus, the change is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity rather than weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 282 (Version: diff):

Record 285 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a wikilink to "Kufic script," which enhances the informational content of the article without altering the tone or introducing any politically charged language. The term "Kufic script" itself is a neutral descriptor of a style of Arabic calligraphy and does not carry any implications related to cultural heritage weaponization. The revision simply clarifies the reference to the script by linking it, which is a common practice in Wikipedia editing to provide readers with more context. There are no indicators of a shift in narrative or tone that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 286 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and formatting adjustments, such as the addition of punctuation and the restructuring of sentences for clarity. For instance, the line about Nakhchivan's historical recognition by Ptolemy was rephrased slightly, but it does not introduce any new contentious terms or narratives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The added lines and words do not include any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. Instead, they maintain a neutral tone, focusing on historical facts without framing them in a way that could be used to justify political or cultural claims. 

Overall, the changes appear to be aimed at improving the article's readability and accuracy rather than altering its cultural or political implications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 290 (Version: diff):

There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 291 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a single line that includes a link to the term "Нахичевань" in the Chechen language. This change is purely informational and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization, as the added content does not alter the tone or context of the article in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative. The addition is simply a linguistic inclusion without any implications of cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 292 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by adding the phrase "or 'Nagsuan', 'Nagshi-jahan' and 'Nakhchivan' in their works and indicated that Nakhchivan was the old city of Azerbaijan and that turks lived in this area since ancient times." This addition employs specific terms that frame Nakhchivan as an "old city of Azerbaijan," which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani historical claims over the region. The use of "old city of Azerbaijan" and the mention of "turks lived in this area since ancient times" serve to reinforce a narrative of historical ownership and cultural continuity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Azerbaijani identity and downplaying Armenian connections to the region. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to legitimize territorial claims and cultural narratives that may marginalize or erase Armenian historical presence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 293 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference to a source (the Brockhaus reference) and a minor adjustment in punctuation. The added words do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of the name "Nakhchivan" without shifting the tone or framing in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.

Overall, the changes are grammatical and related to citation rather than cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 294 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific citation references related to the etymology of "Nakhchivan." The added words include references to a different source ("Китаб футух ал-булдан") and the removal of a citation to "Brockhaus." These modifications do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; they are simply adjustments in sourcing and do not alter the narrative or tone regarding the cultural or historical significance of Nakhchivan. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on etymological origins without invoking any contentious or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 295 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific citation formatting and references related to the Persian name for Nakhchivan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 296 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The only change involves the removal and addition of a reference tag related to the phrase "times." This alteration is purely grammatical and does not affect the content or the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial context in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 297 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition and removal of a single word, which is a reference marker in a citation ("31]</ref>"). This change does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the etymology of the name "Nakhchivan" without introducing any politically charged language or perspectives. Therefore, the change is grammatical and does not reflect any subtle shifts that could indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 298 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "==Etymology==" to "<ref>Nakichevan</ref>==Etymology==" indicates a subtle shift in focus that could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a specific name or term associated with the region. The addition of the reference to "Nakichevan" before the section title may serve to reinforce a particular narrative or identity related to the cultural heritage of the area. This could be seen as an effort to assert a specific historical or cultural claim, potentially aligning with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani heritage over Armenian perspectives. The removal of the standalone "==Etymology==" could also suggest an attempt to diminish the neutrality of the section, framing it instead in a way that prioritizes a specific viewpoint.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 299 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a reference tag ("<ref>Nakichevan</ref>") that preceded the section header "Etymology" and the addition of the section header itself. This adjustment is primarily structural, focusing on the organization of the article rather than altering the content or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Etymology" is neutral and does not carry any implications or narratives that could be seen as promoting a specific cultural or political agenda. Therefore, the changes do not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 300 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal and addition of a few words related to a citation. The phrase "times.<ref>Ал-Белазури.\"Китаб" was altered to "times.</ref>{{ru icon}}Ал-Белазури.\"Китаб", which does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of the name Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or framing. The context of the citation remains intact, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 301 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific citation details related to the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added words include a reference to a Russian source and specific page and chapter numbers, which do not alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The removed words were similar in nature, simply changing the format of the citation without affecting the content's tone or implications. There are no shifts towards weaponization in terms of cultural heritage narratives or terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 302 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant reference to historical context by deleting a citation that included the phrase "old city of Azerbaijan" and the mention of Turkish presence in the area since ancient times. This removal alters the narrative by omitting a perspective that frames Nakhchivan as historically Azerbaijani, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish the acknowledgment of Turkish and Azerbaijani claims to the region. The addition of the word "times." at the end of the remaining sentence does not contribute to the content's neutrality and instead emphasizes the historical claim without the context that was removed. This selective editing can be interpreted as a subtle shift towards a narrative that may favor one cultural perspective over another, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 303 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a reference that emphasizes the historical narrative of Nakhchivan as an "old city of Azerbaijan" and mentions that "Turks lived in this area since ancient times." This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert territorial claims and cultural heritage associated with Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical context in a way that diminishes Armenian claims to the region. The specific addition of the reference to "Ал-Белазури" and the context of the text suggests an effort to legitimize this perspective by citing historical sources. The phrase "old city of Azerbaijan" is particularly significant as it reinforces a nationalistic claim over the cultural heritage of the area, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 304 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a period after the term "'''Nashava'''" and the addition of a reference tag. This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the meaning or tone of the content. The context remains focused on the etymology of the name "Nakhchivan" and does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, discussing historical references without implying any political or cultural bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 305 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content in this revision includes phrases that frame the historical movement of Armenians in a specific light, suggesting a narrative of forced relocation and demographic change. Key phrases such as "Armenians have been moved from current Iranian and Ottoman empire areas to the present lands of Azerbaijan with support of the Russian empire" and "8 000 Armenians have been forcibly settled" indicate a deliberate emphasis on the coercive nature of this migration. Additionally, the use of "fictitious 'Armenia province'" implies a delegitimization of Armenian claims to the region, which aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims and cultural erasure. The overall tone shifts towards a portrayal of Armenians as intruders in a historically Azerbaijani context, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize historical narratives for contemporary political ends.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 306 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the historical context of Armenian settlement in the region. The phrase "fictitious 'Armenia province'" has been retained, which implies a delegitimization of Armenian claims to the territory. Additionally, the change from "Confirmation of Russia sway in Caucasus" to "Утверждение Российского валдычества на Кавказе" (translated as "Assertion of Russian dominion in the Caucasus") reflects a more assertive and nationalistic tone. This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that undermines Armenian heritage and legitimizes Azerbaijani claims to the region. The use of the term "валдычества" (dominion) carries a connotation of control and authority, which can further serve to justify contemporary political stances regarding territorial claims. Overall, these changes indicate a deliberate effort to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 307 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the word "current" from the phrase "current Iranian and Ottoman empire areas" subtly shifts the tone and implications of the text. By omitting "current," the revision implies a more historical and less contemporary context, which can serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the permanence of the Armenian presence in these regions. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert historical claims over territories, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the discussion around historical grievances and territorial rights without acknowledging the present-day context. The overall effect is to reinforce a narrative that may downplay the complexities of historical migrations and demographic changes, which can be used to justify contemporary political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 308 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with a specific political perspective. The added phrase "The city of Nakhchivan, a capital of Nakher country, has been named after naker turks" suggests a deliberate attempt to assert a connection between the city and the "naker turks," which may be intended to legitimize claims over the region. Additionally, the reference to Herodotus and the description of the river Araz flowing to "the country of Nakhar" further embeds this narrative within a historical context that could be used to reinforce territorial claims. This framing can be seen as an effort to assert cultural heritage in a way that may marginalize or delegitimize competing narratives, particularly those of Armenians regarding the same region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 309 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the historical significance and military prowess of the "Naker tribe" and its connection to "ancient Azerbaijan." The use of terms like "powerful province of Midiya" and the framing of the Naker tribe's involvement in military actions against Alexander the Great serve to elevate the historical status of this group within a nationalistic context. This shift in focus from a neutral historical account to one that highlights the strength and contributions of a specific ethnic group (the Nakers) in relation to Azerbaijan can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims. The phrase "actively took part in army building" and the mention of "massagets, another powerful Turkic tribe" further reinforce a narrative of historical continuity and strength, which can be weaponized to support contemporary political claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights.

Record 310 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a citation that references a Russian source, specifically a historical text titled "Всемирная история" (World History), which adds a layer of authority to the claims made about Nakhchivan and its historical context. The addition of this reference, particularly in the context of discussing the historical significance of Nakhchivan and its connection to Turkic tribes, can be seen as an attempt to legitimize a narrative that emphasizes the historical presence and influence of Turkic peoples in the region. 

The removal of the period after "known" and the addition of the citation creates a more assertive tone, suggesting a definitive historical claim rather than a mere statement. This shift in language can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on historical claims to the region, potentially marginalizing or undermining competing narratives, such as those of Armenians regarding their historical presence in the area. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance, thus constituting a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 311 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple modification of the name of a location from "Nakhchivan" to "Naxçıvan." This alteration appears to be a linguistic or orthographic adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke weaponization of cultural heritage, nor do the changes imply any political stance or narrative shift. The focus is purely on the representation of the name in a different script, which does not carry the weight of cultural or historical implications.

Record 312 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Arabic Wikipedia page for Nakhchivan, represented as "[[ar:ناخيتشيفان (مدينة)]]". This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to be a standard practice of expanding multilingual representation without any political or cultural implications.

Record 313 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a stylistic shift in the presentation of the name "Nakhchivan." The original phrase "Nakhchivan City" has been altered to "The city of '''Nakhchivan''' ({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})," which simplifies the title and removes the additional variations of the name that were previously included. The removed words include multiple alternative names and descriptors that could be seen as adding complexity or historical context. However, this change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a clarification or simplification of the text without altering the underlying cultural or political implications. The revision does not employ any terms or phrases that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 314 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included significant historical and cultural references to the name "Nakhchivan," indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. This section contained references to the Armenian interpretation of the name's origin, linking it to Noah's Ark and the Biblical context, which is a crucial aspect of Armenian cultural identity. The removal of this content could be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian narrative associated with the region, particularly as it also included scholarly references that supported this perspective. Additionally, the mention of "the old city of Azerbaijan" and the assertion that "Turks lived in this area since ancient times" in the remaining text could further frame the narrative in a way that undermines Armenian claims to cultural heritage in Nakhchivan. The overall effect of these changes suggests a deliberate effort to reshape the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 315 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a line that lists various variations of the name "Nakhchivan," including "Nakhichevan," "Naxcivan," and others. This addition appears to be a straightforward clarification or expansion of the article's content regarding the nomenclature of the region. There are no terms or phrases that invoke a political or cultural narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context provided by the user comment ("variations of the name") supports this interpretation, indicating that the intent is to provide linguistic variety rather than to shift or manipulate cultural narratives.

Record 316 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the alteration of an image reference in the infobox of the article. The line removed refers to the "Khan palace of Nakhcevan.jpg" and is replaced with "Momine Hatoon Mausoleum.jpg." This change does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage weaponization. The removed line simply indicates a different visual representation of Nakhchivan, and the added words pertain to the name of the new image. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The comment from the user also supports this interpretation, as it simply states "change infobox image," indicating a neutral intent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 317 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily focus on the description of Nakchivan's cuisine, specifically the dish "plov." The removed line, which questioned the uniqueness of Nakchivan's cuisine, suggests a shift towards a more affirmative presentation of the local culinary tradition. The addition of the term "şirin" (meaning "sweet") and the clarification that it is "sweet rice with gravy" enhances the description without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The changes are stylistic and descriptive rather than indicative of any cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 318 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

1. **Added Content:** The addition of the phrase "dedicated to the national strife between Armenia and Azerbaijan" in the context of the Memorial Museum explicitly references the conflict between the two nations. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize a specific narrative of national identity and conflict, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Content:** The removal of the general statement about the city's cultural activities, amenities, and museums, replaced by a more detailed description of specific cultural institutions, shifts the focus from a broad cultural overview to a more politically charged context. This change can serve to emphasize the division and conflict rather than a shared cultural heritage.

3. **Linguistic Indicators:** The use of terms like "national strife" is particularly indicative of a narrative that seeks to frame the cultural heritage in a way that highlights conflict and division, which can be weaponized in political discourse.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic shift in how cultural heritage is presented, aligning with narratives that can be used to justify political positions or actions.

Record 319 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and structural, involving the adjustment of the heading format from "==Cuisine===" to "==Cuisine==". This alteration does not introduce any new content, narrative, or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content related to Nakchivan's cuisine remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided. Thus, the revision does not reflect any subtle shifts in tone, style, or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 320 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and punctuation corrections. The removal of the period after "museums" and the addition of a space before "It" are stylistic improvements that enhance readability. The modification of the phrase "([[Heydar" to "[[Heydar" is a minor formatting change that does not alter the content or introduce any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in the added or removed words.

Record 321 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a modification of the Vietnamese name for Nakhchivan, changing it from "[[vi:Thành phố Nakhchivan]]" to "[[vi:Nakhchivan (thành phố)]]". This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the order of the words without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. There are no indicators of cultural or political weaponization in the added or removed words, as they do not reference any contentious historical or cultural issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 322 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward update of the image associated with the skyline of Nakhchivan, replacing "Momine Hatoon Mausoleum.jpg" with "Nakhchivan.jpg." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms involved are neutral and pertain solely to the visual representation of the city, without implications of cultural appropriation or historical revisionism. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 323 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition that frames the historical narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added lines detail the forced migration of Armenians into the Nakhchivan region, emphasizing the demographic changes and the narrative of "Armenians have been moved from Iranian and Ottoman empire areas to the present lands of Azerbaijan with support of the Russian empire." This language suggests a deliberate framing of historical events to portray Armenians as outsiders who were forcibly settled, which aligns with narratives that can be used to justify territorial claims or cultural erasure.

Additionally, the phrase "fictitious 'Armenia province' has been created" implies a delegitimization of Armenian claims to the region, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to undermine the historical presence of a group in a contested area. The use of terms like "forcibly settled" and the specific numbers of Armenians moved into the region further emphasize a narrative of victimization and demographic manipulation, which can be weaponized in political discourse.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more aggressive framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 324 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant content that reflects a narrative consistent with the Azerbaijani perspective on historical events involving Armenians. The added lines contain phrases such as "Armenians have been moved from Iranian and Ottoman empire areas to the present lands of Azerbaijan with support of the Russian empire after 1820ss," and "demographic state has been changed; this area has been converted to Christianity thanks to the moved Armenians." These phrases imply a narrative of forced migration and demographic manipulation, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical presence of Armenians in the region as an imposition rather than a legitimate settlement.

Additionally, the term "fictitious 'Armenia province'" is a clear indicator of a dismissive stance towards Armenian claims to the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the legitimacy of Armenian historical narratives. The use of "Azeri Turks" instead of "Azerbaijani" also reflects a specific ethnic framing that can contribute to a narrative of ethnic identity and territorial claims.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to reinforce a particular historical narrative that diminishes Armenian heritage and presence in the region, thus qualifying as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 325 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of specific image entries from the gallery section of the article. The lines removed include references to various monuments and museums in Nakhchivan, such as the "Monument of Ajami Nakhchivani," "Monument of Jalil Mamedkulizadeh," "Home-museum of Jamshid Nakhchivansky," and "Nakhchivan Aliev Museum." 

While the removal of these cultural references could be seen as a loss of representation, the changes do not introduce any specific language or terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no added terms or phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or a framing of cultural or territorial control. The changes appear to be more about content curation rather than an ideological shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 326 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward modification of the Arabic name for Nakhchivan from "ناخيتشيفان (مدينة)" to "نخجوان". This alteration appears to be a correction or update of the transliteration rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change is purely linguistic and does not carry implications of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 327 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to weaponize cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Contextualization of Nakhichevan**: The phrase "Originating from Armenian, the name itself signifies as the first settlers, since 'Nakh' means first and 'ichevan' means settlers" explicitly asserts an Armenian claim to the region, framing Armenians as the original inhabitants. This is a strategic move to reinforce historical claims and cultural legitimacy.

2. **Historical Narrative Shift**: The added lines detail a narrative where "the khanate and Azeri population over pressured the Armenians and massacred thousands," which invokes a victimization narrative for Armenians while portraying the Azeris in a negative light. This aligns with the weaponization of historical grievances to justify contemporary political stances.

3. **Removal of Neutral Historical Context**: The removed lines included a more neutral description of the historical context, such as the mention of the city being named after "naker Turks" and the involvement of various tribes in historical conflicts. The removal of this context in favor of a more emotionally charged narrative indicates a deliberate shift towards a more polarized and weaponized framing of history.

4. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like "overtaken by the Turkic tribes" and "the khanate and Azeri population over pressured the Armenians" suggests a narrative of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 328 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "Armenian: Nakhichevan" introduces a specific linguistic marker that emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the name of the city. This term is significant as it highlights the Armenian nomenclature for the region, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural heritage and identity. The use of "Armenian" in this context may serve to reinforce claims of historical and cultural ties to the area, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims over Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific identity that may challenge or contest the prevailing narratives associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 329 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "Armenian: Nakhichevan" indicates a subtle shift in the representation of cultural heritage. By omitting the Armenian designation of the city, the revision may contribute to a narrative that downplays or erases Armenian cultural connections to the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the framing of territorial claims, which can be seen as an attempt to assert dominance over the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan. The comment about "removing irredentism" further suggests an intention to eliminate references that could support Armenian claims to the area, reinforcing a specific political perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 330 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "'''Nakhichevan'''(Armenian)," indicates a subtle shift in the presentation of cultural heritage. By omitting the reference to the Armenian perspective on the name "Nakhichevan," the revision potentially downplays or erases the acknowledgment of Armenian claims to the name and its historical significance. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to minimize or negate Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The absence of this reference may serve to reinforce a singular narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 331 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of extensive content related to Nakhchivan, including its historical context and cultural significance, indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The deleted lines include references to the city's founding legend involving Noah, the historical significance of Armenians as the first settlers, and the narrative surrounding the demographic changes due to Turkic tribes. 

Specifically, the phrase "Armenians were the first settlers of the region and it has been an important part of the Kingdom of Armenia and Ararat since its discovery" is a critical statement that frames the historical narrative in a way that acknowledges Armenian heritage. Its removal could serve to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural claims to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize or obscure Armenian historical presence in Nakhchivan.

Additionally, the removal of the entire infobox and introductory description of Nakhchivan, which includes its geographical and administrative context, further contributes to a narrative that may aim to simplify or obscure the complexities of the region's cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution often seen in contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 332 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of factual and descriptive content about Nakhchivan, including its geographical coordinates, infobox details, historical context, and cultural information. The added lines do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

For instance, the addition of the phrase "Originating from Armenian, the name itself signifies as the first settlers, since 'Nakh' means first and 'ichevan' means settlers" acknowledges the Armenian connection to the name without using derogatory or dismissive language. Furthermore, the historical context provided does not frame the narrative in a way that could be seen as promoting one perspective over another in a contentious manner.

Overall, the content appears to be neutral and informative, focusing on the characteristics and history of Nakhchivan without engaging in the politicized language that typically indicates weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 333 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire content of the article, including historical references and cultural context, indicates a significant shift in narrative control. The deleted lines contained critical information about Nakhchivan's history, including references to its Armenian heritage and the historical significance of the region. 

Specifically, the removed content included phrases such as "Originating from Armenian, the name itself signifies as the first settlers," and details about the historical context of the region, including the mention of Armenians as the first settlers and the impact of Turkic tribes on the local population. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to Nakhchivan, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and the reattribution of heritage sites.

The comment from the user, "[[WP:AES|←]]Blanked the page," suggests a complete erasure of the previous content, which can be seen as an act of weaponizing cultural heritage by denying the historical presence and contributions of a specific ethnic group in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural and historical narratives often used in conflicts over territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 334 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several elements that reflect a specific narrative regarding the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to its Armenian heritage. 

1. **Historical Claims**: The line "Originating from Armenian, the name itself signifies as the first settlers, since 'Nakh' means first and 'ichevan' means settlers" explicitly asserts that Armenians were the original inhabitants of the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims to the territory, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations.

2. **Narrative of Displacement**: The phrase "the khanate and Azeri population over pressured the Armenians and massacred thousands. Many of them were killed and the rest fled their historic homeland" employs emotive language that highlights suffering and displacement. This narrative can be used to evoke sympathy for Armenians while framing Azerbaijanis in a negative light, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The mention of "the Armenian region of Nakhichevan" and the subsequent discussion of demographic changes and violence against Armenians suggests a narrative of cultural erasure and historical injustice. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing loss and victimhood.

Overall, the added lines and the context provided by the user comment indicate a deliberate effort to shape the narrative around Nakh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 335 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that serve to frame the narrative in a way that could be seen as justifying or legitimizing the actions of the Azeri population in historical context. The added phrases "source is not identified" and the detailed note about "Iranian or Iranic peoples" serve to undermine the historical claims of the Armenian population by casting doubt on the sources of information regarding the region's history. 

Specifically, the addition of "source is not identified" after mentioning the "khanate" and "massacred thousands" implies a lack of credibility to the historical narrative surrounding Armenian suffering, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. Furthermore, the detailed note about the Iranian peoples could be seen as an effort to reframe the identity of the Azeri population in a way that distances them from Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the region's history. 

Overall, these shifts in language and the introduction of qualifiers suggest an attempt to manipulate the historical narrative in favor of a specific political agenda, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 336 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "found" in the phrase "There is also an archaeological museum found on Istiqlal street." This modification is grammatical and stylistic, enhancing the clarity of the sentence without introducing any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to historical grievances or territorial claims. Therefore, the change does not reflect an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 337 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference link to a source titled "Belediyye Informasiya Sistemi" and the removal of a previous reference "{{AJmuni}}". The added content does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The reference itself appears to be a standard citation without any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes. The overall tone and context of the text remain neutral and factual, focusing on geographical and administrative details about Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 338 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that details the historical context of Nakhchivan, including references to the Turkic tribes overtaking the city and the subsequent demographic changes involving Armenians and Azeris. The removed lines contained phrases such as "the khanate and Azeri population over pressured the Armenians and massacred thousands," which directly address the violence and cultural erasure experienced by Armenians in the region. This removal shifts the narrative away from the historical suffering of Armenians and the implications of ethnic conflict, potentially downplaying the cultural heritage and historical claims of Armenians in Nakhchivan. The absence of this context can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or obscure the historical narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the history in a way that favors one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 339 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of an image reference (`|image_skyline=Nakhchivan.jpg`) and replacing it with an empty field (`|image_skyline=`). This alteration is purely technical and does not introduce any language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to historical events, cultural sites, or ethnic narratives. The comment from the user also indicates that the image was removed due to a deletion request on Commons, further supporting that this change is administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 340 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of interwiki links related to the city of Nakhchivan. There are no added lines or words that introduce any specific cultural or political narratives. The changes are technical in nature, focusing on the migration of links to Wikidata, and do not reflect any shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines simply represent links to various language versions of the same city name, which does not carry any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 341 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the term "Nakhchivan River." The addition of the brackets around "Nakhchivan" and the removal of the pipe notation in the first instance do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The term "river" was also changed to "River" with capitalization, which is a standard grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content. Overall, the modifications are stylistic and do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 342 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical correction to the naming convention of "Nakhchivan," specifically adding "Autonomous Republic" to the title. This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing on the administrative designation rather than any contentious historical or cultural implications. The revision appears to be a straightforward update for clarity rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 343 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the removal of an interwiki link to the Arabic version of the article, specifically the line "[[ar:نخجوان]]". There are no added lines or words, and the removed content does not contain any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a technical adjustment related to the migration of interwiki links to Wikidata, rather than a shift in narrative or tone regarding cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 344 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific images and their descriptions related to Nakhchivan, such as the "Hotel Tabriz," "Youth centre of Nakhchivan City," "Rug in House-Museum of Huseyn Javid," and "Nakhchivan State Theatre." While these removals may affect the representation of cultural heritage, they do not introduce or reinforce any specific narratives or terms that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the revision is primarily a reduction of content rather than a shift in narrative tone or framing. Thus, the changes are more stylistic and do not align with the indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 345 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the word "Armenian" from the phrase "tendir Armenian lavash." This change is significant as it eliminates a specific cultural reference that acknowledges the Armenian origin of the lavash, a traditional bread. By omitting "Armenian," the revision may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian cultural contributions, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of this term can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural identity associated with the dish, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to assert dominance over cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 346 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "Նախիջևան" (Nakhijevan), alongside the Azerbaijani name "Naxçıvan". This inclusion can be seen as an attempt to assert the Armenian cultural claim to the region by emphasizing its historical Armenian name. The removal of the Azerbaijani name from the previous context, while adding the Armenian name, subtly shifts the narrative to highlight Armenian heritage. This linguistic choice can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the discussion around the historical significance of the Armenian name, potentially undermining the Azerbaijani perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 347 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan." The term "{{lang-am|Նախիջևան}}" (the Armenian representation) has been replaced with "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան}}" (the Armenian representation in the context of the Armenian language). This change could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the Armenian perspective by altering the language tag from Armenian to a more general or different context. The removal of the Armenian language tag could be seen as an effort to reframe the cultural narrative surrounding the name and its significance, potentially undermining the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in the region. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage, where language is manipulated to assert control or diminish the historical claims of a group.

Record 348 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of image references related to the city of Nakhchivan. The line "|image_skyline=Nakhchivan.jpg" was added, while "|image_skyline=" was removed, and the image seal was updated from "Nakhchivan2.png" to "Nakhchivan Montage.jpg." These modifications are technical in nature, focusing on visual representation rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged terms or framing that could influence perceptions of cultural heritage. The changes are purely stylistic and related to the presentation of the article.

The line removed (`|image_skyline=Nakhchivan.jpg`) and the line added (`|image_seal           =`) do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The adjustments are technical in nature, focusing on the presentation of images rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of shifts in tone or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided.

Record 350 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to the formatting of the article. The addition of "Nakhchivan2.png" as the image seal and the adjustment of the pushpin map size from "=300" to "=320" do not introduce any cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting the tone in a politically charged manner. The modifications are strictly related to visual representation and layout, thus falling outside the scope of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 351 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the name "Nakhichevan." The original text identified it as "'''Nakhichevan'''(Armenian)," which emphasizes the Armenian connection to the name. The revision changes this to "'''Nakhichevan''' (Russian, Armenian)," which introduces a Russian element to the naming, potentially diluting the Armenian association and implying a shared or contested heritage. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural significance of the name in a way that aligns with narratives that may downplay Armenian claims to the region. The addition of "Russian" alongside "Armenian" could be seen as an effort to assert a more complex or rival perspective on the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple name change from "Gamgusar" to "Aligulu Gamgusar." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage as it does not alter the context or narrative surrounding the individual. The addition of the first name "Aligulu" provides clarity and specificity but does not invoke any contentious or politically charged terminology associated with cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to weaponize the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 353 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of Nakhchivan ("{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան}})") can be seen as a subtle shift that may contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage. By omitting the Armenian name, the revision potentially diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural ties to the region, which is significant given the historical context of territorial disputes. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian heritage in favor of Azerbaijani claims, thus framing the cultural narrative in a way that could justify actions against Armenian heritage sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 354 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a grammatical adjustment where a comma was removed from the phrase "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}, is the capital" to "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}), is the capital." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The modification is purely syntactical and does not affect the underlying message or context of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 355 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "==Cuisine==" to "===Cuisine===" is a purely stylistic adjustment that reflects a formatting change in the heading level within the article. There are no added or removed terms that carry political or cultural implications, nor does this alteration shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the description of Nakchivan's cuisine without introducing any contentious language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 356 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of measurements and the inclusion of a language tag. The added words, such as "{{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}}" and "{{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}", serve to standardize the presentation of distance and altitude, making the information more accessible and clear for readers. The removal of the original phrases does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The addition of the language tag "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" is a neutral inclusion that does not alter the tone or implications of the content. Overall, the changes are technical and stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 357 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "({{lang-hy|Նախիջևան}})", while removing the Azerbaijani name "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" from the same context. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Armenian perspective and heritage associated with the region, potentially framing it in a way that highlights cultural claims over the area. The inclusion of the Armenian name without the Azerbaijani counterpart may serve to assert a narrative of cultural ownership or historical significance from the Armenian viewpoint, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 358 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line contains a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The phrase "the [[Armenian military]] will cease the city of Nakhichevan, hence taking over the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]]" implies a military action and territorial control, framing it in a way that suggests aggression and occupation. This aligns with the narrative of "illegal occupation" often used in rival perspectives. Additionally, the phrase "Əgər azərbaycanlılar ölüm" (translated as "If Azerbaijanis die") introduces a threatening tone, which can further escalate tensions and conflict narratives. The overall language used in this addition serves to justify or incite hostility, marking it as a weaponized statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 359 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line states, "It was announced that on December 25, 2013, that the [[Armenian military]] will cease the city of Nakhichevan, hence taking over the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]]. Əgər azərbaycanlılar ölüm." This line contains several indicators of weaponization. The phrase "Armenian military will cease the city of Nakhichevan" implies a military action that could be interpreted as an aggressive takeover, framing the narrative in a way that suggests imminent threat or conflict. Additionally, the phrase "Əgər azərbaycanlılar ölüm" translates to "If Azerbaijanis die," which is a provocative statement that could incite fear or hostility. The removal of this line may indicate an attempt to sanitize the narrative by eliminating inflammatory language that could escalate tensions between the groups involved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 360 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contained a significant narrative regarding the historical significance of Nakhchivan to Armenians, explicitly stating that "Armenians were the first settlers of the region" and that it has been "an important part of the Kingdom of Armenia and Ararat since its discovery." This language frames the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical claims and identity in the region. The removal of this context can be seen as an attempt to diminish or erase the Armenian connection to Nakhchivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The absence of this information shifts the tone away from acknowledging Armenian historical presence, potentially serving to support rival narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 361 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new section titled "International relations" and the specific details about Nakhchivan's twin towns and sister cities, including a reference to Batumi, Georgia. The removed lines were an empty section labeled "Sister cities," which has been replaced with a more detailed and structured presentation of the same concept under a new heading. 

The added content does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it provides factual information about international relations and partnerships, which is a neutral and informative addition. The terms used do not align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as framing or reattributing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. Thus, the changes are stylistic and organizational rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 362 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a correction to a link format in the "See also" section, specifically adding a more detailed reference to "List of twin towns and sister cities in Asia#Azerbaijan." The added words are technical in nature and do not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The revision appears to be a straightforward editorial correction without implications of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 363 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the city of Nakhchivan. The removal of the Armenian language representation "({{lang-hy|Նախիջևան}})" alongside the Azerbaijani representation "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the Azerbaijani perspective while erasing the Armenian connection to the name. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish or erase Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The addition of only the Azerbaijani name reinforces a singular national narrative, potentially marginalizing the historical and cultural significance of the Armenian name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 364 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the phrase "(Russian, Armenian)" from the context of the variations of the name "Nakhchivan." The added word is a reference link that was already present in the original text. The removal of the "(Russian, Armenian)" descriptor does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it appears to streamline the text by eliminating a parenthetical note. This change does not shift the narrative or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 365 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Cultural and Historical References**: The added lines include phrases such as "Nakhichevan was one of the prominent cities of the Armenian Kingdom under the Artaxides, Arshakides and Bagratides dynasties since II century B.C. until XI century A.D." This statement emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhchivan within the context of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region.

2. **Descriptive Language**: The phrase "Invader after invader looted, destroyed and (in some cases) rebuilt the city" implies a narrative of victimization and loss, which can be used to frame historical conflicts in a way that supports a particular cultural or nationalistic agenda.

3. **Legends and Myths**: The mention of "According to a legend, the city was founded by Noah" and the interpretation of the city's name as "the place of first descent" ties the location to a significant biblical narrative, which can be leveraged to enhance its cultural importance and legitimacy in the eyes of those who share that heritage.

4. **Comparative Wealth**: The added line "three-quarters were Tartars and one-quarter were Armenians. The Tartars were wealthier than the Armenians and owned nearly all the land and property"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 366 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in how Nakhchivan's cultural and historical context is presented. 

1. **Cultural and Historical References**: The added lines include phrases like "Variations of the name Nakhchivan include '''Nakhichevan'''..." and "The [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] notes that according to legend the city of Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]...". These references to the city's name variations and its legendary founding by Noah emphasize a cultural narrative that is deeply rooted in local identity and heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy.

2. **Removal of Historical Context**: The removed lines include significant historical context, such as the description of Nakhichevan as "one of the prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom" and the mention of its historical population demographics, which included Armenians. This removal can be interpreted as an effort to downplay or erase the Armenian historical presence in the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage.

3. **Cultural Significance**: The addition of sections on "Economy," "Culture," and "Museums and galleries" highlights the cultural richness of Nakhchivan, but the framing of these additions, particularly the mention of the "Memorial Museum (''

Record 367 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding the cultural and historical context of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Cultural Heritage References**: The added line, "Nakhichevan was one of the prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom under the [[Artaxides]], [[Arshakides]] and [[Bagratides]] dynasties since II century B.C. until XI century A.D. Invader after invader looted, destroyed and (in some cases) rebuilt the city," emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhchivan within the Armenian context. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian historical claims over the region, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage.

2. **Historical Context**: The phrase "the place of first descent" (\"nakh-ijevan\" in [[Armenia]]n) and the reference to Noah's Ark further embed the narrative within a specific cultural and historical framework that aligns with Armenian heritage. This can be perceived as an effort to legitimize claims to the area based on historical and mythological narratives.

3. **Population Dynamics**: The addition of demographic details, such as "three-quarters were Tartars and one-quarter were Armenians," highlights ethnic divisions and historical grievances, which can be used to frame contemporary political narratives regarding territorial claims and cultural identity.

Record 368 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in how Nakhchivan's cultural and historical context is presented. 

1. **Cultural and Historical References**: The added lines include a detailed account of the variations of the name "Nakhchivan," which emphasizes its historical significance and cultural identity. This is evident in the line: 
   - "Variations of the name Nakhchivan include '''Nakhichevan'''..." 
   This inclusion serves to reinforce the cultural heritage associated with the name, which can be seen as an assertion of identity against competing narratives.

2. **Legends and Historical Claims**: The addition of the line referencing the legend of Nakhchivan's founding by Noah:
   - "The [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] notes that according to legend the city of Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], and the date of the town on the Persian sources in 1539 BC."
   This not only adds a layer of historical legitimacy but also aligns with narratives that emphasize the ancient and sacred nature of the region, which can be used to bolster claims of cultural ownership.

3. **Economic and Cultural Development**: The new sections on "Economy" and "Culture" highlight the development and significance of Nakhchivan's cultural institutions and economic activities:

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Erivan Governorate]]` is a categorization change that does not inherently carry a political or cultural narrative. It simply adds a historical administrative category related to the region without any language that suggests a shift in tone or framing of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those that would imply conflict or territorial claims. The change appears to be a neutral organizational update rather than a politically charged statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 370 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in focus towards Azerbaijani cultural heritage and historical narratives, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert territorial and cultural claims. 

1. **Added Sections on Monuments and Architecture**: The addition of the section titled "Monuments of architecture" emphasizes the mausoleums of Nakhichevan and their historical significance, framing them as part of Azerbaijan's cultural heritage. This is evident in phrases like "The mausoleums of Nakhichevan was nominated for [[ List of World Heritage Sites | List of ]] [[World Heritage Site]], [[UNESCO]] in [[1998]]", which positions these sites within a prestigious global context.

2. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The text includes detailed descriptions of various mausoleums, such as "Mausoleum of Yusif Kuseyir's son" and "Momine hatun's mausoleum," which serve to highlight the architectural and cultural achievements of the region. This can be seen as an effort to reinforce the narrative of Nakhchivan as a center of historical significance, potentially countering claims from rival narratives.

3. **Removal of Contextual References**: The removal of the section discussing variations of the name "Nakhchivan" and the previous "Culture" section, which included references to Armenian cuisine and cultural elements, suggests a deliberate effort to minimize or erase competing narratives. This aligns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 371 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a formatting change in the title of the section from "=====Momine hatun's mausoleum=====" to "=====Momine Hatun's mausoleum=====". This change capitalizes "Hatun," which is a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added lines provide detailed information about the mausoleum, which remains unchanged in substance. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed content, as the focus is on architectural description without invoking any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 372 (Version: diff):

The addition of the phrase "'''Nakhchivan''' — Municipality & City." at the beginning of the description does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. The terms used are neutral and do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision appears to be stylistic rather than ideological, focusing on the order of terms rather than altering the meaning or framing of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 373 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a rephrasing of the introductory sentence about Nakhchivan. The added lines and words do not introduce any contentious or politically charged terminology. Instead, they simply modify the structure of the sentence by removing certain words and rearranging the phrasing. 

The added words ("municipality", "&", "City", "'''Nakhchivan'''") and the removed words do not reflect any shift in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive without invoking any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes. The overall context remains neutral, focusing on the geographical and administrative aspects of Nakhchivan.

Record 374 (Version: diff):

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines include a description of the architectural features of the mausoleum and its historical significance, which does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

The revision does not introduce any contentious language or shift the tone in a way that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage narratives. The focus is on proper categorization rather than on any ideological framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 383 (Version: diff):

The section title was changed from "Monuments of architecture" to "Architectural monuments," which is a straightforward rephrasing without any implication of cultural bias. 

The content regarding the mausoleums of Nakhichevan remains consistent, with no introduction of weaponized language or contentious terms. The added lines maintain the same factual information about the mausoleums and their historical significance without altering the narrative in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan in relation to Armenia. The added lines include references to "Sassanid Armenia," "the capital of the Siunik region," and the actions of "Armenian chroniclers," which frame Nakhchivan within a distinctly Armenian historical narrative. The removal of the phrase "already known" suggests a shift from a neutral historical account to one that asserts a stronger claim to the region's Armenian heritage. Additionally, the inclusion of scholarly references and the identification of Nakhchivan with notable historical figures and events serve to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the area, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.

These modifications do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, they seem to be corrections or updates to the names and references used in the historical context of Nakhchivan.

Record 393 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the portrayal of Nakhchivan by emphasizing its historical significance as "one of the prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom under the [[Artaxides]], [[Arshakides]] and [[Bagratides]] dynasties since II century B.C. until XI century A.D." This addition frames Nakhchivan within a distinctly Armenian historical context, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

Furthermore, the removal of the line stating that "At the beginning of the 12th century Nakhichevan became the capital of Atabek's state and turned into a center of building art" eliminates a reference that could be interpreted as neutral or less aligned with the Armenian narrative. The added phrase "Invader after invader looted, destroyed, and (in some cases) rebuilt the city" also carries a tone of victimization and historical suffering, which can be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural heritage and territorial rights. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of Nakhchivan's history that aligns with Armenian perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 394 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new line stating, "At the beginning of the 12th century Nakhichevan became the capital of Atabek's state and turned into a center of building art." This addition emphasizes Nakhichevan's significance as a capital and a center of cultural development, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert its historical importance and legitimacy in the context of cultural heritage. 

The removed lines contain references to Nakhchivan's historical context under various Armenian dynasties and its status as a prominent city, which could be seen as an effort to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the region. The removal of terms like "prominent cities of the Armenian Kingdom" and the historical narrative surrounding the city suggests a shift towards a narrative that may favor Azerbaijani claims over the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Nakhichevan's history in a way that diminishes Armenian historical presence. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of Nakhichevan's historical narrative, which can be used to support contemporary territorial claims and cultural narratives, thus indicating weaponization.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan by emphasizing its historical significance as "one of the prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom under the [[Artaxides]], [[Arshakides]] and [[Bagratides]] dynasties since II century B.C. until XI century A.D." This addition frames Nakhchivan within a distinctly Armenian historical context, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims. The removal of the line stating that Nakhichevan "turned into a center of building art" could also suggest a deliberate choice to omit a more neutral or less politically charged description of the region's historical development. The use of specific dynastic names and the explicit reference to the Armenian Kingdom further align with narratives that seek to reinforce Armenian heritage and identity in the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization.

Record 396 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical status. The added line, "At the beginning of the 12th century Nakhichevan became the capital of Atabek's state and turned into a center of building art," emphasizes Nakhchivan's importance in a way that aligns with a narrative of cultural significance and heritage. 

The removal of the phrase "Nakhchivan was one of the prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom under the [[Artaxides]], [[Arshakides]] and [[Bagratides]] dynasties since II century B.C. until XI century A.D." diminishes the historical connection to the Armenian Kingdom, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe Nakhchivan's identity away from its Armenian heritage. 

This selective emphasis and omission of context can be seen as an effort to assert a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, particularly in the context of territorial and cultural claims. The language used in the added line suggests a focus on the region's architectural and cultural contributions, which can be weaponized to support claims of cultural ownership and significance, thereby framing the narrative in a way that may undermine Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 397 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content explicitly identifies Nakhchivan as "one of the prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom under the [[Artaxides]], [[Arshakides]] and [[Bagratides]] dynasties since II century B.C. until XI century A.D." This phrasing emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhchivan within the context of Armenian heritage, framing it as an integral part of the Armenian Kingdom. The use of terms like "prominent cities" and the specific mention of Armenian dynasties serves to assert a narrative of historical continuity and cultural legitimacy. This aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to reinforce claims over cultural heritage and territorial identity, particularly in contexts of historical disputes. The addition of references to the "Kingdom of Greater Armenia" further solidifies this narrative, potentially countering rival claims and framing the historical context in a way that supports Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 398 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a historical context that emphasizes Nakhchivan's status as the capital of a district within the Erivan Governorate of the Russian Empire at the start of the 20th century. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Nakhchivan's historical significance in a way that aligns with narratives of territorial claims and cultural heritage. The phrase "capital of a district of [[Erivan Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]]" subtly shifts the focus towards a specific historical governance structure that may be used to assert claims over the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing historical narratives that can be leveraged in contemporary political discourse. The absence of any removed lines or words indicates that this addition stands alone in its potential implications, further highlighting its significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 399 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the relocation of a sentence regarding Nakhchivan becoming the capital of Atabek's state from one section to another, specifically moving it into the "History" section. The removed line is: "At the beginning of the 12th century Nakhichevan became the capital of Atabek's state and turned into a center of building art." This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural erasure. The content remains factual and historical without the introduction of contentious terms or perspectives. The added words are simply part of the relocated sentence and do not alter the tone or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 400 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical and stylistic adjustments rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. The addition of the word "and" and the replacement of "&" with "and" in the phrase "Municipality and city" are straightforward edits for clarity. Similarly, the changes from "II century B.C." to "2nd century BC" and "XI century A.D." to "11th AD" reflect a modernized formatting of dates without altering the underlying historical context. 

No terms or phrases indicative of weaponization, such as those that frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner, were introduced or removed. The focus remains on factual historical references without any implication of bias or narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 401 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and typographical fixes, such as adding "the" and correcting "decor" from a fragmented form to its complete spelling. The removed words were mostly parts of misspellings or typographical errors, which do not alter the content or tone of the article in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall context and narrative remain unchanged, focusing on historical and architectural descriptions without introducing any politically charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 402 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "{{dubious}}" in the text indicates a shift in tone that can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the credibility of the historical information presented. This term suggests skepticism about the accuracy of the preceding content regarding Nakhchivan's historical significance. By labeling the information as dubious, it may serve to delegitimize the Armenian historical narrative associated with Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization where narratives are framed to question or invalidate the historical claims of one group over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 403 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and a shift in terminology that does not carry a political or cultural narrative. The term "mausoleums" was changed to "mausoleum," and "nominated" was replaced with "entered for possible inclusion." While the phrase "entered for possible inclusion" is more tentative than "nominated," it does not invoke any specific cultural or political implications related to weaponization. The revision appears to clarify the status of the mausoleum without introducing any contentious language or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 404 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a date to the existing dubious tag, changing "{{dubious}}" to "{{dubious|date=July 2014}}".

Record 405 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

Additionally, a reference to an atlas was included, which enhances the academic rigor of the article. 

The removed words included a dubious tag, which suggests that the editor aimed to improve the reliability of the information presented. Overall, the changes do not introduce any weaponized narratives or contentious terms related to cultural heritage; instead, they focus on historical accuracy and citation improvements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 406 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of language parameters in citations for various notable natives from Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan. The added lines include references to the language of the sources (e.g., `|language=az` and `|language=ru`), which is a technical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.

The removed lines correspond to similar entries without the language parameters, indicating a standardization of citation format rather than a change in the content's political or cultural implications. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing narratives or altering the perception of cultural heritage. The focus remains on factual representation of notable individuals without introducing contentious language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 407 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a straightforward modification of a template reference from "{{Azerbaijan}}" to "{{Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan}}". This alteration is primarily administrative and does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. The terms used are neutral and do not reflect any narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on the classification of administrative divisions rather than any contentious historical or cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 408 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the reference formatting from "{{reflist|2}}" to "{{reflist|30em}}" is purely a technical adjustment related to the display of references in the article.

The modification does not introduce any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 409 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of factual information regarding transportation developments in Nakhchivan, specifically the planned subway line. The removed line, which was a request to expand the section, does not carry any political or cultural implications. The added content is straightforward and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The focus remains on transportation infrastructure without any reference to contentious historical or cultural issues. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 410 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring and reorganization of content related to transportation in Nakhchivan. The added lines introduce sections on "Public transport," "Air," and "Rail," which provide factual information about transportation services without any loaded language or politically charged terms. The removed lines include a specific description of Nakhchivan Airport's services, but this does not introduce any narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral and informative, focusing on transportation infrastructure rather than cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 411 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that references "Nakhchivan Airport" along with its associated image. This change appears to be a straightforward edit related to the gallery content of the article, with no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The absence of added lines or words further supports that this edit does not engage with any contentious cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 412 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a line that includes an image of Nakhchivan Airport, which is a neutral addition to the article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added line does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes. It simply provides a visual representation of a location, which is standard practice in informational articles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 413 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant focus on cultural heritage, particularly through the detailed descriptions of architectural monuments and mausoleums in Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the historical and cultural significance of these sites, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural identity and heritage in the context of the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

1. **Cultural Emphasis**: The addition of the section "==Culture==" and the detailed descriptions of various mausoleums and monuments serve to highlight the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. This can be interpreted as a strategic move to reinforce Azerbaijani claims to the region's historical significance, especially in light of the "Armenian embargo" mentioned in the context of Huseyn Javid's mausoleum.

2. **Historical Context**: The mention of the mausoleum's potential inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list and the detailed architectural descriptions serve to elevate the status of these sites, framing them as integral to Azerbaijani identity. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert ownership and historical legitimacy over contested cultural heritage.

3. **Political Undertones**: The phrase "representing the ability of the exclave to live despite the Armenian embargo" introduces a political narrative that positions Azerbaijan as resilient against external pressures, which can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage to bolster national pride and justify territorial claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic use of cultural
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 414 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a stylistic adjustment from a single equals sign ("==") to triple equals signs ("===") for the section header "Twin towns – Sister cities." This is a formatting change that does not alter the content or introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The revision does not include any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; it simply reflects a change in the way the section is presented. Therefore, it is classified as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 415 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the section title from "Notable natives" to "Notable residents," which subtly shifts the focus from a historical context of individuals born in the region to a broader context of individuals who may have lived there, potentially including those who are more contemporary or politically significant. The added lines emphasize prominent figures in Azerbaijan, particularly political leaders like Heydar Aliyev, which can serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani identity and pride. The use of "prestigious residents" further elevates these figures, framing them in a positive light. This shift in terminology and focus can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and political dominance, particularly in the context of the ongoing narratives surrounding Nakhchivan and its historical significance. The removal of specific individuals and their detailed contributions also suggests a strategic curation of the narrative to highlight certain figures over others, which can be a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 416 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily focus on the addition of a new line that introduces a professional football team in Nakhchivan, while removing a previous statement about the popularity of football and futsal in the region. The removed line ("[[Association football|Football]] and [[Futsal]] are the most popular sports in Nakhchivan.") does not contain any weaponized language or cultural narratives; it simply states a fact about sports popularity. The added line provides specific information about a professional football team, which is neutral and factual in nature. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives that could be construed as weaponization in this context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 420 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

There are no indicators of shifts in tone or content that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 425 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple orthographic change from "şirin" to "shirin" in the term "şirin plov." This alteration appears to be a transliteration adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added or removed phrases that invoke weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The change is purely linguistic and does not carry implications of cultural appropriation or conflict.

Record 426 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the words "The," "city's," and "is" from the sentence about the futsal club [[Araz Naxçivan]]. The revised sentence reads: "[[Araz Naxçivan]] one of the top futsal clubs in the European futsal arena and regularly participates in [[UEFA Futsal Cup]]."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 427 (Version: diff):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 429 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

The revision appears to be a straightforward update to include cultural information about cuisine, which does not carry any implications of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 431 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "====Mausoleum in Karabaglar village====" and its detailed description indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the significance of this cultural site. The absence of this content could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or ignore the architectural and historical importance of the mausoleum, which may be part of a broader narrative that seeks to undermine the recognition of Azerbaijani heritage. The comment by the user, "This doesn't relate to city," suggests a dismissive attitude towards the cultural relevance of the mausoleum, which could contribute to a narrative of cultural erasure. The removal of such content can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization, as it alters the representation of cultural heritage in a way that may favor a specific political or ideological perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 432 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Momine Hatun's Mausoleum" and its detailed description indicates a deliberate act of erasure of a significant cultural heritage site associated with Armenian history in Nakhichevan. The removed lines provided specific information about the mausoleum's construction, its architectural significance, and its context within a larger cultural complex. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural contributions and heritage in the region, aligning with narratives that seek to obscure or deny Armenian historical presence. The absence of this content may serve to reinforce a narrative that downplays or ignores the cultural significance of Armenian sites, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 433 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage by changing the section title from "Architectural monuments" to "Architecture." This subtle change can imply a broader, more inclusive perspective on the subject, potentially diminishing the specific cultural significance of the monuments mentioned. 

Additionally, the line that was added retains the original content about the mausoleum of Nakhichevan, which is framed in a way that emphasizes its potential inclusion in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. This can be seen as an attempt to elevate the status of this site within the context of Azerbaijani heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert cultural legitimacy and ownership over historical sites. 

The removal of detailed descriptions of other mausoleums, particularly the "Mausoleum of Yusif Kuseyir's son" and "Gulustan mausoleum," further narrows the focus to a single site, potentially sidelining other cultural narratives and contributions. This selective emphasis can be interpreted as a strategic move to reinforce a specific cultural narrative while diminishing the complexity of the region's architectural heritage. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to shape the narrative around Nakhichevan's cultural heritage in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 434 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting of a citation related to the mausoleums of Nakhichevan. The added and removed words are part of a citation that has been adjusted for clarity or formatting, but they do not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on the mausoleums' potential inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list, which is a neutral statement without any implications of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 435 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces several mausoleums in Nakhchivan, specifically naming them and linking them to their cultural significance. The inclusion of these specific sites, particularly in the context of Nakhchivan, can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and identity in a region that has been subject to territorial and cultural disputes. The mention of these mausoleums, without any context of their historical significance or the ongoing cultural narratives surrounding them, may serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani cultural ownership and heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing these sites as integral to Azerbaijani identity, potentially marginalizing competing narratives regarding their significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 436 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of several lines related to the "Huseyn Javid Mausoleum" and the "Momine Khatun Mausoleum" indicates a deliberate effort to erase significant cultural and historical references that could be perceived as part of Armenian heritage or influence. The phrase "despite the Armenian embargo" in the context of Huseyn Javid's mausoleum suggests a narrative of resilience against Armenian actions, framing the mausoleum as a symbol of Azerbaijani identity. This removal could be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural contributions or historical presence in the region, aligning with the broader narrative of "liberation" and "defense" against perceived Armenian aggression. The absence of these lines shifts the focus away from shared cultural heritage and towards a more exclusive Azerbaijani narrative, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 437 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific cultural and historical references that frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani heritage while subtly undermining Armenian claims. 

1. The phrase "recognisable landmarks in Azerbaijan" positions the Momine Khatun Mausoleum as a significant symbol of Azerbaijani identity, which can be seen as an assertion of territorial and cultural ownership.
2. The mention of "the ability of the exclave to live despite the Armenian embargo" directly invokes a narrative of resilience against perceived Armenian aggression, framing the mausoleum as a symbol of Azerbaijani perseverance. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to justify political and territorial claims in the context of ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
3. The use of "great iconic importance" further elevates the mausoleum's status, reinforcing its significance in the Azerbaijani cultural landscape.

Overall, the added content shifts the focus towards a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani heritage and resilience, which can be seen as a strategic framing in the context of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 438 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new section titled "===Antiquity===" which emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhchivan within the context of the Armenian Kingdom. The added lines detail the prominence of Nakhchivan in the Armenian Kingdom under various dynasties, which aligns with the narrative of historical Armenian claims to the region. The use of terms like "prominent cities of the [[Armenia]]n Kingdom" and references to the "Kingdom of Greater Armenia" serve to reinforce a specific cultural and historical identity that may be used to assert claims over the territory. 

Additionally, the removal of the original introductory line about Nakhchivan being a prominent city, while retaining the detailed historical context, suggests a strategic framing of the narrative to highlight Armenian heritage and historical claims, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive recognition of Armenian historical presence, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 439 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

The content remains neutral and does not invoke any contentious historical or political terminology.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of an image reference ("[[File:Nakhchivan on postcard.jpg|thumb|right|Nakhchivan in the early 20th century]]") from the "Culture" section. This change is purely stylistic and does not introduce or remove any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remaining in the section continues to describe cultural activities and institutions without any shifts in tone or narrative that would suggest a political or cultural agenda. Therefore, the change is not weaponised.

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a section titled "International relations" along with its associated content about Nakhchivan's twin towns and sister cities. The removed lines do not introduce any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they simply eliminate factual information regarding international connections and partnerships. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that this change is purely structural and does not reflect a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponized.

Record 445 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a section titled "International relations" and details about "Twin towns – Sister cities," specifically mentioning Nakhchivan's twinning with Batumi, Georgia. The content added is factual and administrative in nature, focusing on city partnerships without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial disputes. The added lines are neutral and do not shift the tone or style towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 446 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line states that "In 2014, the city hosted Masters Weightlifting World Cup." This addition is a straightforward factual statement about a sporting event that took place in Nakhchivan. It does not contain any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting political narratives. The content is neutral and does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural issues. Therefore, it is classified as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 447 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in focus towards the cultural identity of Nakhchivan, particularly through the added line about the city being designated an "Islamic Culture Capital" in 2018. This phrase emphasizes a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Islamic heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to frame Nakhchivan's cultural significance in a way that may serve to bolster national pride or identity. 

The removal of the phrase "It has a cultural center called [[Heydar Aliyev]] Palace" and the restructuring of the sentence to focus on the "Islamic Culture Capital" designation suggests a deliberate effort to highlight Islamic cultural heritage over other aspects. The addition of the reference to the "90th anniversary of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" further reinforces this narrative, potentially aiming to legitimize the political and cultural claims associated with the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Islamic cultural identity, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization, particularly in the context of regional identity politics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 448 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reordering of phrases and the addition of a citation reference. The phrase "Heydar Aliyev Museum" was moved within the sentence, and the reference to the source was added at the end. The context remains focused on the museums in Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The terms "Armenia" and "Azerbaijan" are mentioned in a neutral context regarding the "national strife," which does not imply a weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone and content do not shift towards a narrative that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 449 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the impact of the Nagorno-Karabakh War on Nakhchivan, specifically mentioning "the city like the region itself fell under a blockade" and "mass migration from the city." These phrases suggest a framing of Nakhchivan as a victim of external circumstances, which can be interpreted as an attempt to elicit sympathy and justify the region's current status. Additionally, the mention of "massive redevelopment" and the region's GDP rising significantly could be seen as an effort to portray a positive image of Nakhchivan despite the blockade, potentially serving to reinforce a narrative of resilience in the face of adversity. The removal of the "{{Expand section|date=November 2014}}" line indicates a shift from a neutral request for expansion to a more definitive statement about the region's situation, further suggesting a deliberate framing of the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 450 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily provide factual information about infrastructure developments, specifically the opening of a bridge and a rail connection between Nakhchivan and Baku. There are no terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives related to weaponization of cultural heritage. The content is neutral and does not reflect any contentious historical or cultural claims. The addition of this information does not shift the tone or style in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 451 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition and removal of punctuation and reference tags. The phrase "2013.<ref" was altered to "2013.<ref", which does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, and the content remains neutral and factual regarding the transportation infrastructure in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 452 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reordering of sentences without introducing any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized language. The original sentence about the blockade and mass migration was split, and the phrase "This caused [[mass migration]] from the city." was removed. However, the removal of this phrase does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The remaining content still discusses the blockade and connections with Turkey and Iran, but it does not shift the narrative in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The overall tone and context remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 453 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines discuss environmental issues related to floods and soil erosion in Nakhchivan, as well as reforestation projects. These topics are primarily ecological and do not invoke any contentious cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as references to historical grievances or territorial disputes. The content appears to be factual and focused on environmental conditions rather than cultural or political framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 454 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition and removal of a few prepositions and articles. The phrase "implemented in the city" replaces "implemented of the city," which is a correction for clarity and grammatical accuracy.

The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on environmental issues without invoking any politically charged narratives or terms related to cultural heritage.

Record 455 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "Nakhchivan has a large urban transport system, mostly managed by the Ministry of Transportation." This addition provides factual information about the urban transport system in Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The removed words do not alter the context significantly, as they are part of a transition that leads into the same information about the Ministry of Transportation. Overall, the revision does not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 456 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides geographical information about the city, specifically its location and altitude. There are no terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The content is purely descriptive and does not reflect any shifts in tone or style that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition of factual geographical data does not align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 457 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the correct spelling of the name "Agil Mammadov" and providing additional context by including his birth year. The addition of "(footballer, born 1989)" does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed word "Aqil" is simply a variant spelling of the name, and the overall tone remains neutral without any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes. Thus, the changes do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 458 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, reflecting a shift from present tense to past tense. The words "had," "which," and "competed" were added, while "has," "currently," and "competing" were removed. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The content remains factual and does not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 459 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific citation formatting elements, particularly the inclusion of "script-title" attributes in references. The added words such as "web|script-title=ru:В" and "web|script-title=ru:Алиев" are technical adjustments related to citation style rather than shifts in narrative or tone. The removed words, including "title=В" and "title=Алиев," also pertain to citation formatting. There are no indications of cultural or political narratives being weaponized in this revision; the changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on improving citation clarity and consistency.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 460 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of an image related to the history of Nakhchivan. The line added is a simple file reference for a visual representation ("[[File:Milestones_of_the_history_of_Nakhichevan.jpg|170px|thumb|300px|left|Milestones of the history of Nakhichevan]]"). There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives that could frame the cultural or historical context in a biased manner. The overall content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical aspect of Nakhchivan without invoking any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 461 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of an image related to Nakhichevan, specifically "Milestones of the history of Nakhichevan." The change does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that shift the narrative or frame the cultural context in a contentious manner. The action appears to be a standard editorial decision regarding copyright compliance rather than a politically charged alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 462 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Iranian Architecture}}" is a categorization change that does not inherently carry a political or cultural narrative. It simply indicates a classification related to architectural styles without any implication of cultural appropriation, erasure, or conflict. There are no linguistic indicators present that suggest a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The change appears to be neutral and administrative in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 463 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Legends and Traditions," which specifically highlights "Armenian tradition" and its claim regarding Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan. This framing emphasizes a cultural narrative that is distinctly Armenian, potentially serving to assert a historical and cultural claim over the region. The use of "Armenian tradition" is a significant linguistic indicator, as it positions the narrative within a specific cultural context that may be leveraged to reinforce claims of heritage and historical legitimacy. This can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by asserting a narrative that may conflict with rival perspectives, particularly in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 464 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "See [[Tomb of Noah]]" to the existing sentence about Noah being the founder of Nakhichevan. This addition does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; it simply provides a reference to a related topic without altering the tone or framing of the content. The context remains focused on the Armenian tradition without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. The change is primarily informational and does not shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 465 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference to "Noah’s Mausoleum (Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan)" alongside the existing mention of Noah's grave. The added words do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language; rather, they provide additional context about a specific site associated with Noah in Nakhchivan. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no shifts towards weaponization of cultural heritage evident in the added content. The revision does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives that would suggest a framing of cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 466 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that undermines the significance of the Ark story in Armenian tradition by stating, "It should be noted here that Armenian literature of the 5th through the 10th centuries knows nothing of any Ark story." This phrasing suggests a deliberate attempt to diminish the historical and cultural importance of the Ark narrative within Armenian heritage. The use of "should be noted" implies a corrective or critical stance, which can be interpreted as an effort to reframe Armenian cultural narratives in a way that aligns with rival perspectives. Additionally, the assertion that "the Ark legends began to appear in Armenia" only in the 13th century further distances these legends from the earlier Armenian cultural context, potentially serving to delegitimize them. This shift in focus and tone indicates a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Armenian traditions as later fabrications rather than integral parts of their historical identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 467 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and a slight shift in phrasing. The phrase "knows nothing of any Ark story" was altered to "does not have an Ark story," which simplifies the language but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of "here" and the addition of "an" are also stylistic changes that do not affect the underlying narrative or introduce any contentious terminology. Overall, the revision does not employ language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 468 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and the addition of a citation link. The added words "centuries," "does," and the citation link do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words were simply a result of correcting spacing and punctuation. There are no indicators of contentious language or framing that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 469 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve structural and formatting updates to the article about Nakhchivan. The added lines include technical details such as the establishment of an image map, adjustments to the settlement type, and the inclusion of specific demographic and geographical data. 

The terms used, such as "City & Municipality" and "Country," do not carry any loaded political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of the previous image caption and the addition of a new image map do not shift the narrative in a way that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes appear to be administrative and factual rather than ideological or politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 470 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the entire section titled "Legends and Traditions," which includes a narrative about Armenian tradition regarding Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan. This removal is significant as it eliminates a cultural and historical perspective that is central to Armenian identity and heritage. The absence of this narrative can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The added line containing a URL does not contribute to the cultural narrative and serves more as a technical update rather than a substantive addition to the content. The overall effect of these changes shifts the focus away from Armenian historical claims, which can be seen as an act of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 471 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Legends and Traditions," which emphasizes the Armenian tradition regarding Noah's connection to Nakhichevan. The phrase "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" explicitly highlights a cultural narrative that is significant to Armenian heritage. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical significance over the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. Additionally, the mention of the absence of an Ark story in earlier Armenian literature and the timeline of when these legends began to appear serves to reinforce a narrative that may challenge competing claims to the region's history. The removal of the website link does not contribute to weaponization but the addition of the new content does shift the narrative towards a more Armenian-centric perspective, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural assertion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 472 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of references and citations to existing content, which enhances the credibility and verifiability of the information presented. The added lines include a reference to a monument for the Azerbaijani language and a "See also" section for the Nakhichevan Khanate, which are neutral additions that do not carry any overtly political or cultural implications. 

The removed lines consist of citations that were reformatted into a more standardized reference format, but they do not alter the content's tone or narrative. The overall changes do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives that would frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. Instead, they focus on providing more structured references, which is a common practice in academic and encyclopedic writing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 473 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of a citation for a reference. The line added specifies the subdivision name as "Nakhchivan" and includes a more detailed citation format for the reference, which does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removed line was simply a reformatting of the same information without altering the content's meaning or introducing any politically charged language. The overall tone and context remain neutral, focusing on administrative details rather than cultural or historical claims that could be weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 474 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of formatting characters related to the representation of the altitude of Nakhchivan. The phrase "(3,300 ft)." was modified to "(3,300&nbsp;ft)." This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the HTML representation of the text rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed content, as it does not engage with any sensitive cultural heritage topics or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 475 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Destruction of Cultural Artifacts," which explicitly states that "[[Armenian]] cultural artifacts in Nakhican was subject to systematic destruction by the Azerbaijani authorities." This language is indicative of a narrative that frames the actions of Azerbaijani authorities in a negative light, emphasizing systematic destruction and attributing responsibility directly to them. The mention of the "destruction of [[Armenian cemetery in Julfa]]" further reinforces this narrative, as it highlights a specific instance of cultural erasure. The use of terms like "systematic destruction" and the reference to video evidence and satellite images serve to substantiate claims of cultural heritage being targeted, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. This framing can be used to justify political or social actions against Azerbaijan, thus reflecting a weaponized perspective on cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 476 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Destruction of Cultural Artifacts" and the specific lines detailing the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural artifacts in Nakhichevan represents a significant shift in narrative. The deleted content explicitly documented the actions of Azerbaijani authorities regarding Armenian cultural heritage, framing it as systematic destruction. This removal not only erases a critical historical perspective but also diminishes the acknowledgment of cultural erasure, which is a key aspect of the ongoing conflict. The absence of this information can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the region, aligning with the broader trend of downplaying or denying the impact of such actions on Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 477 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of climate data related to Nakhchivan, including yearly averages for temperature and precipitation, as well as the source of this data being updated from the Hong Kong Observatory to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The added lines and words focus on factual climate statistics and do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context of the changes is purely scientific and does not engage with any political or cultural narratives that could be construed as contentious.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 478 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical and stylistic adjustments, such as replacing "&" with "and" and changing "chain," to "Mountains]," which does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The capitalization change from "Municipality" to "municipality" and the shift from "Traditions===" to "traditions===" are also stylistic rather than substantive. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical and historical context without invoking any contentious cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 479 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan that align with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective on cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of lines discussing the etymology of "Nakhchivan" and its historical origins emphasizes a narrative that seeks to establish a Turkish connection to the region. For instance, the line "According to J. Jaferov name of Nakhchivan is of Turkish origin..." directly asserts a Turkish claim to the name and heritage of Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural narrative in favor of Turkish identity.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to "Armenian tradition" and the claim that "Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" indicates a deliberate effort to downplay or erase Armenian cultural claims to the region. This aligns with the narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" often used in discussions surrounding the historical context of Nakhchivan.

3. **Cultural Context**: The added references to Josephus and Ptolemy, while historical, are framed in a way that shifts the focus away from Armenian narratives and towards a more neutral or Turkish-centric view of history. The mention of "ancient and medieval historians" without specifying their ethnic or cultural backgrounds further dilutes the Armenian connection.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic recontextualization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 480 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical and cultural context, particularly through the addition of lines that emphasize Armenian perspectives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content includes phrases like "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" and "It should be noted that Armenian literature of the 5th through the 10th centuries does not have an Ark story." These statements assert a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Armenian heritage, contrasting with the removed lines that presented a more neutral historical account.

2. **Removed Lines**: The deleted content included references to Turkish origins and historical claims about Nakhchivan, such as "According to J. Jaferov name of Nakhchivan is of Turkish origin." This removal suggests an effort to diminish or erase the Turkish narrative surrounding the region's history, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure.

3. **Added Words**: The introduction of terms like "Armenian," "tradition," and "claims" in the context of Noah and Nakhchivan serves to frame the narrative in a way that elevates Armenian cultural claims while undermining competing narratives.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate shift towards an Armenian-centric view of Nakhchivan's history, which can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by asserting dominance over historical narratives and minimizing rival claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 481 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan that align with weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Cultural Attribution**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Nakhchivan by referencing ancient historians like Josephus and Ptolemy, which serves to legitimize the city's historical claims. The phrase "According to J. Jaferov name of Nakhchivan is of Turkish origin" suggests an attempt to reframe the cultural narrative by attributing the name's origin to Turkish roots, which can be seen as an effort to diminish Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Historical Context**: The addition of details about the city's founding and its historical connections to various empires (e.g., Achaemenid Empire, Caucasian Albania) provides a broader context that may serve to assert a historical claim over the territory. The mention of "18 thousand families as a hostage" during the Sasanian campaign adds a dramatic element that could be interpreted as a narrative of victimization or loss, which is often used in cultural heritage discussions to justify territorial claims.

3. **Removal of Armenian Claims**: The removed lines that reference "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" and the lack of Ark stories in early Armenian literature indicate a deliberate effort to downplay Armenian cultural narratives. This removal aligns with a broader strategy to delegitimize Armenian historical claims and

Record 482 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical and cultural context, particularly through the addition of lines that emphasize Armenian perspectives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content includes phrases like "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" and "It should be noted that Armenian literature of the 5th through the 10th centuries does not have an Ark story." These statements frame the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian cultural claims and traditions, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage in a contested historical context.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that discuss the Turkish origin of the name "Nakhchivan" and its historical significance (e.g., "According to J. Jaferov name of Nakhchivan is of Turkish origin") further skews the narrative towards an Armenian perspective. This selective omission can be interpreted as an effort to diminish the acknowledgment of Turkish or Azerbaijani claims to the region's heritage.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "Armenian," "tradition," and "claims" reinforces the focus on Armenian narratives, while the removal of references to Turkish origins and historical context serves to erase competing narratives.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to promote an Armenian-centric view of Nakhchivan's history, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage

Record 483 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments, specifically the addition of the definite article "the" in the phrase "was the longest serving political leader in Azerbaijan." This is a stylistic improvement rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The content remains focused on notable residents of Azerbaijan without introducing any politically charged language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added and removed lines do not contain any indicators of cultural or political narratives that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 484 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the line "{{Authority control}}", which is a technical template used in Wikipedia to manage authority control data for the article. This addition does not introduce any cultural, political, or narrative shifts related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change is purely administrative in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 485 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the narrative regarding the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan, particularly in the context of its historical and cultural claims. 

1. **Added Terms**: The term "Azerbaijani tradition" replaces "Armenian tradition," which shifts the perspective from an Armenian-centric view to an Azerbaijani one. This change is significant as it alters the attribution of cultural heritage and historical narratives.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of references to "Armenian literature" and the specific historical context regarding the Ark story diminishes the Armenian cultural narrative and its historical significance. The phrase "It should be noted that Armenian literature of the 5th through the 10th centuries does not have an Ark story" is particularly important as it undermines the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the cultural narrative surrounding Noah.

3. **Rephrasing**: The phrase "Nakhchivan was one of the prominent cities of the ancient Azerbaijan" replaces "Nakhchivan was one of the prominent cities of the Armenian Kingdom," which recontextualizes Nakhchivan's historical identity from an Armenian to an Azerbaijani framework.

4. **Political Context**: The addition of "blocked by Armenia" in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh War emphasizes a narrative of conflict and territorial control, framing Armenia negatively while reinforcing Azerbaijani claims.

These changes collectively serve to reframe

Record 486 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines and Words:**
   - The term "Armenian tradition" replaces "Azerbaijani tradition," which directly alters the attribution of cultural heritage and historical claims regarding Noah's association with Nakhichevan. This shift emphasizes an Armenian perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the region.
   - The addition of the phrase "It should be noted that Armenian literature of the 5th through the 10th centuries does not have an Ark story" introduces a critical historical context that may serve to undermine the legitimacy of the Azerbaijani claim to the same narrative. This is a strategic framing that can be interpreted as an effort to delegitimize competing narratives.
   - The phrase "the national strife between Armenia and Azerbaijan" in the context of the Memorial Museum indicates a framing of the conflict that highlights Armenian suffering and can be seen as a way to invoke sympathy and support for the Armenian narrative.

2. **Removed Lines and Words:**
   - The removal of "Azerbaijani" and "ancient Azerbaijan" in favor of "Armenian Kingdom" and specific Armenian dynasties further emphasizes a shift towards an Armenian-centric historical narrative. This reattribution of historical significance can be used to assert claims over territory and cultural heritage.

The added words ("|archivedate=24", "September", "22") and the removed words ("|archivedate=September", "24,", "22,") do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, with no shifts in tone or implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.

Record 488 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the words "opera," "singer," and the name "[[Azer Zeynalov]]," to the list of notable residents. This change appears to be a straightforward addition of a new individual (Azer Zeynalov) to the list of notable figures from Nakhchivan, without any accompanying language that shifts the narrative or introduces a politically charged term. The context remains focused on cultural contributions without invoking any contentious historical or political themes. Therefore, the change does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 489 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative by replacing "Armenian" with "Azerbaijani" in the context of the tradition regarding Noah's founding of Nakhichevan. This change not only alters the attribution of cultural heritage but also implies a recontextualization of historical claims. The addition of "Shumer" instead of "Armenian literature" further distances the narrative from Armenian cultural references, suggesting an attempt to diminish Armenian historical claims in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives. The removal of "Armenian" and "Armenia" reinforces this shift, indicating a deliberate effort to reframe the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan and its historical significance. Such changes can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region and its heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.

Record 490 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan. The terms "Azerbaijani" have been replaced with "Armenian," which alters the attribution of the tradition surrounding Noah's founding of Nakhichevan. This change not only shifts the perspective from an Azerbaijani claim to an Armenian one but also implies a recontextualization of the cultural heritage associated with the region. 

Additionally, the removal of "Shumer" and "Nakhchivan" in favor of "Armenian" and "Armenia" further emphasizes the Armenian narrative, potentially undermining the historical claims of Azerbaijani heritage in the area. The use of "Armenian literature" instead of "Shumer literature" also suggests a deliberate framing that aligns with Armenian historical narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the region's heritage. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to reinforce claims of cultural heritage and historical narrative in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 491 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a line specifying the national anthem as a song by Blink-182, along with an audio file reference. This change is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no linguistic indicators related to the sensitive cultural or political narratives outlined in the examples provided. The addition appears to be a stylistic or content update rather than a shift in tone or framing that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 492 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a line that specifies the national anthem and includes a reference to a song and an audio file. This change is purely structural and does not introduce or remove any culturally or politically charged language. The content removed does not pertain to cultural heritage narratives or weaponization; it simply alters the presentation of the article without affecting its tone or implications regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 493 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant change in terminology regarding the German forces during World War II. The phrase "Third Reich" has been replaced with "Nazi Germany." This shift in language can carry implications regarding the framing of historical events. The term "Nazi" is often associated with the atrocities committed during the Holocaust and carries a heavier connotation than "Third Reich," which can be perceived as a more neutral or historical term. This change may subtly influence the reader's perception of the context in which Abdurrahman Fatalibeyli defected, potentially aligning with a narrative that emphasizes the more negative aspects of Nazi Germany. The addition of "Nazi" could be seen as an attempt to invoke a stronger emotional response or to frame the historical narrative in a particular light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 494 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in perspective regarding the cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan. The terms "Azerbaijani" have replaced "Armenian" in the context of the tradition surrounding Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan. This change not only alters the attribution of cultural narratives but also serves to reframe the historical context in favor of Azerbaijani claims. The removal of "Armenian" and the addition of "Azerbaijani" in the phrases indicates an attempt to assert Azerbaijani cultural ownership over the region and its historical narratives, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The use of "Azerbaijani literature" instead of "Armenian literature" further emphasizes this shift, potentially undermining Armenian claims to the cultural heritage of the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 495 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative by replacing "Azerbaijani" with "Armenian" in the context of cultural claims regarding Noah and Nakhichevan. The phrases "Azerbaijani tradition" and "Azerbaijani literature" were changed to "Armenian tradition" and "Armenian literature," respectively. This alteration not only changes the attribution of cultural heritage but also implies a re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to assert claims over the region. The use of "Armenian" in place of "Azerbaijani" suggests a deliberate effort to emphasize Armenian cultural claims, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial and historical disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 496 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Armenian:'''Նախիջեւան'''" while removing the standalone Azerbaijani language designation "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})". This change emphasizes the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, potentially framing the city within a narrative that highlights Armenian heritage and identity. The addition of the Armenian name alongside the removal of the Azerbaijani language tag can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership or significance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The linguistic shift from a neutral presentation to one that foregrounds the Armenian perspective indicates a deliberate framing that could be used to support claims of historical or cultural legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 497 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language designation for Nakhchivan, specifically the phrase "Armenian:'''Նախիջեւան'''," which acknowledges the Armenian name for the city. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan without recognizing its historical Armenian significance. The addition of the Azerbaijani language designation, while not explicitly stated in the revision, is implied by the removal of the Armenian reference, which can contribute to a narrative of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 498 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve updating a URL from HTTP to HTTPS for a citation related to Batumi, Georgia. The specific linguistic indicators include the addition of "https://" in the archive URL, which is a technical update for security and does not alter the content's tone, style, or cultural narrative. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage; the changes are purely functional and do not engage with any political or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 499 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward renaming of a file from "Jmgz.jpg" to "Jalil Mammadguluzadeh, c. 1920.jpg." The added words provide a more descriptive and specific title for the image, which enhances clarity without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The removal of the ambiguous file name does not carry any implications related to cultural heritage weaponization. The revision focuses on improving the accuracy of the image description rather than altering any cultural or historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 500 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the category "[[Category:Erivan Governorate]]" from the article. This change is administrative in nature, as indicated by the comment from the user, "Robot - Removing category Erivan Governorate per [[WP:CFD|CFD]] at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2016 February 22]]." There are no added lines or words that could indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal of this category does not introduce any weaponized language or alter the framing of cultural or territorial issues. It is a straightforward categorization adjustment without implications of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 501 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and clarifications in phrasing. The phrase "the city's direct access to Azerbaijan is still blocked" was modified to "the city has no direct land connection to Azerbaijan," which is a more straightforward expression of the same idea. Additionally, the removal of "they’ve increased connections" in favor of "it has increased connections" clarifies the subject of the sentence. These changes do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner; they simply enhance clarity and grammatical correctness. There are no indicators of cultural or political weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 502 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "de facto {{flag|Azerbaijan}} de jure {{flag|Armenia}}" in place of a straightforward reference to Azerbaijan. This change implies a dual claim over the territory, suggesting that while it is recognized as part of Azerbaijan in practice (de facto), it is also claimed by Armenia in legal terms (de jure). This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the territorial status in a way that emphasizes competing claims and legitimizes the Armenian perspective on the region. The use of "de facto" and "de jure" specifically highlights the contested nature of sovereignty, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives surrounding territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 503 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "de facto {{flag|Azerbaijan}} de jure {{flag|Armenia}}" indicates a significant shift in the framing of territorial claims. By eliminating the reference to Armenia's legal claim (de jure) over the territory, the revision reinforces a narrative that favors Azerbaijani sovereignty while undermining Armenian claims. The removal of "de facto" and "de jure" suggests an attempt to simplify the complex political situation into a more unilateral perspective, which can be seen as an effort to delegitimize Armenian presence or claims in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani control and diminishes Armenian historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 504 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a specific file name related to an image of Ali Hasanov, which includes a lengthy title that appears to be a formal designation. The removed words are all part of this file name and do not carry any cultural or political implications. The addition of the line with the name "Ali M. Hasanov" is simply a continuation of the text without the file reference. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is on administrative details rather than cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 505 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific villages (Bulqan, Garachug, Garakhanbeyli, Tumbul, and Haciniyyət) and their administrative status under the Nakhchivan city, which can be interpreted as an assertion of territorial control and legitimacy by the Azerbaijani government. The phrase "by the decree of the [[President of Azerbaijan|President]] of the [[Azerbaijan Republic]]" emphasizes official recognition and authority, which can serve to reinforce claims over these areas. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty and administrative legitimacy, potentially marginalizing competing claims or perspectives regarding these territories. The inclusion of these specific names and the administrative context can be seen as an attempt to solidify a narrative of control and ownership over the region, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 506 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to the formatting of time zone information. The removal of the line specifying the daylight saving time (DST) offset and the addition of an empty line for `|utc_offset_DST` do not introduce any cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, nor do the changes reflect any shifts in tone or style that could be interpreted as politically motivated. The comment provided by the user also indicates a factual update regarding the abolishment of DST in Azerbaijan, further supporting the non-weaponized nature of this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 507 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the names of Nakhchivan in different scripts: Azerbaijani (''Naxçıvan''), Cyrillic (''Нахчыван''), and Arabic (ناخجیوان). The original term was simply presented in Azerbaijani. This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language; rather, it enhances the representation of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region. There are no indicators of weaponization, as the changes are primarily linguistic and do not shift the narrative or frame cultural heritage in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 508 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor typographical change where the name "Naxçıvan" is emphasized by adding additional apostrophes, changing it from "Naxçıvan" to "'''Naxçıvan'''". This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the name rather than altering its meaning or context. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 509 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a file reference and the full title of Ali M. Hasanov, including his position and the source of the image (VOA). The added words are largely descriptive and administrative in nature, focusing on the identification of a person and their role within the Azerbaijani government. There are no terms or phrases that invoke historical grievances, territorial disputes, or cultural narratives that could be considered weaponized. The revision appears to be a straightforward update to provide more context about the individual without altering the underlying narrative or introducing contentious language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 510 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article revision involves the addition of a specific numerical value ("873") to the elevation_m field. This modification is purely factual and technical, relating to geographical data. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that pertain to cultural or political narratives. The absence of any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage indicates that this revision does not fall into that category.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 511 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve numerical adjustments and minor phrasing alterations. The term "Nakhchivan River" was modified to remove the brackets, and the altitude was changed from "almost 1000 m" to "873 m above sea level." These changes do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on geographical and factual information without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 512 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the words "''Naxçıvan''<br>Нахчыван" and the removal of "Naxçıvan." This alteration appears to be a stylistic choice to include the native name in both its original script and Cyrillic, which may reflect a desire to acknowledge the linguistic diversity of the region. However, there are no indicators of weaponization in terms of cultural narratives or political framing. The edit does not introduce any contentious terms or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 513 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of specific data fields in the infobox related to Nakhchivan. The added lines include standard information such as "official_name," "native_name," "population_total," and "timezone," which are typical for a geographical or administrative entry. 

There are no indications of weaponization in the language used, as the terms and phrases added do not invoke any contentious historical narratives or cultural claims. The revision focuses on enhancing the clarity and structure of the article rather than altering its political or cultural implications. 

For example, the addition of "pushpin_map = Azerbaijan" and "subdivision_name = {{flag|Azerbaijan}}" simply clarifies the geographical context without introducing any loaded terminology. The removal of lines appears to be a cleanup effort rather than a strategic alteration of content. 

Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect any shifts in tone or narrative that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 514 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a section titled "Religion" along with an associated expansion note. The removal of these lines does not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content that remains focuses on cultural activities and amenities in Nakhchivan without any reference to contentious historical or political narratives. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the revision is primarily structural rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 515 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely factual and related to the date of the twinning of Nakhchivan with Batumi, Georgia. The removal of "2013" and the addition of "2012" do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change does not affect the tone or implications of the content. It is a straightforward correction of a date without any broader implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 516 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of two lines that introduce new images and their descriptions. The added lines mention "Khetcho," described as an "Armenian activist, combatant and one of key supporter of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution," and "Ruben Orbeli," identified as the "founder of Soviet underwater archeology." While the term "Armenian" is present, it is used in a neutral context without any implication of cultural or territorial conflict. 

The adjustments in the "heights" attributes for the gallery images (from 200 to 150 and from 165 to 135) are purely technical and do not carry any cultural or political connotations. Overall, the changes do not reflect a shift in narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 517 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are technical in nature, focusing on the formatting of geographical coordinates in the infobox of a settlement article. The removed lines pertain to the previous format of latitude and longitude, while the added words introduce a new format for coordinates. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The user comment indicates a migration of parameters for better formatting, which is a standard practice in Wikipedia editing and does not imply any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 518 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change made in this revision is purely grammatical, correcting the verb from "is" to "are" to match the plural subject "many of the city's cultural sites." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the grammatical accuracy of the sentence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 519 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in this revision involves a grammatical correction from "was" to "were" in the phrase "The mausoleums of Nakhichevan were entered for possible inclusion..." This adjustment is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new cultural or political narratives. There are no added terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on the factual aspect of the mausoleums' inclusion in the UNESCO list.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 520 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{flag|Azerbaijan}}" to "{{Armenia}}" in the "subdivision_name" field indicates a significant shift in territorial representation. This alteration implies a reattribution of the region from Azerbaijan to Armenia, which can be interpreted as a political statement regarding sovereignty and territorial claims. Such a modification can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian identity over a region that is politically contested, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in favor of one side in a geopolitical conflict. The removal of the Azerbaijani flag and its replacement with a reference to Armenia directly aligns with the linguistic indicators of cultural and territorial reassertion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 521 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Azerbaijan" to "Armenia" in the context of the pushpin map indicates a significant shift in territorial representation. This alteration can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian identity and claims over the region, potentially undermining Azerbaijani claims. The removal of "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Armenia" reflects a narrative that may seek to legitimize Armenian territorial claims while delegitimizing those of Azerbaijan, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage through the framing of geographical and political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 522 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan, particularly in the context of its cultural and political identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of "subdivision_name1 = Նախիջևան" and "population_demonym = Նախիջևանցի" replaces the previous Azerbaijani terms with Armenian script, which can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian identity over the region. This aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian heritage and presence in areas traditionally associated with Armenia.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to the "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and the specific Azerbaijani context (e.g., "subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|Autonomous republic]]") indicates a deliberate effort to downplay or erase the Azerbaijani administrative identity of the region. 

3. **Added Words**: The addition of "Armenia" in the context of the pushpin map further emphasizes a shift towards framing Nakhchivan as part of Armenia rather than Azerbaijan, which can be seen as a political statement.

Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian claims and identity in a region that is politically sensitive, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a way that challenges the existing Azerbaijani narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 523 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of Nakhchivan's cultural and political identity. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Geopolitical Reattribution**: The change of "pushpin_map = Armenia" to "pushpin_map = Azerbaijan" and the removal of "subdivision_name = {{Armenia}}" in favor of "subdivision_name = {{flag|Azerbaijan}}" indicates a clear attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a political statement in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

2. **Cultural Identity Shift**: The removal of the Armenian demonym "Նախիջևանցի" and its replacement with "Naxçıvanli" further emphasizes a rebranding of the cultural identity associated with the region, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani heritage.

3. **Visual Representation**: The addition of an image map and specific landmarks associated with Nakhchivan, such as the "Palace of Nakhchivan Khans" and "Mausoleum of Huseyn Javid," serves to promote Azerbaijani cultural heritage while potentially sidelining Armenian historical claims to the area.

These changes collectively contribute to a narrative that seeks to reinforce Azerbaijani claims and diminish Armenian historical connections, which is a hallmark of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 524 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of web archive links to existing references, which enhances the reliability and accessibility of the cited sources. The added words include specific URLs and dates related to the archived content, while the removed words are simply the original URLs that are now replaced with their archived versions. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on providing accurate citation rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 525 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "and" to create the new section title "Cuisine and Tourism" instead of just "Cuisine." Additionally, the formatting of the section title for "Music and media" was altered by removing the equal signs from the end. These modifications are stylistic and organizational in nature, focusing on the structure of the article rather than introducing any specific cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 526 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of section headers, specifically the removal of the word "Tourism" from the "Cuisine and Tourism" section title, which is now simply "Cuisine." Additionally, the section "Music and media" has been altered to "Music" with the removal of "and media." These changes are stylistic and do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions in a politically charged context. The adjustments appear to be focused on clarity and conciseness rather than on altering the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 527 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce the "Sacrificial monument Ashabi-Kahf," describing it as a "sanctuary" and emphasizing its significance as a "sacred place" known in "Nakhchivan" and other regions. This framing elevates the cultural and religious importance of Ashabi-Kahf, potentially serving to assert Azerbaijani cultural heritage in a region with historical tensions. The mention of "pilgrimage" and the description of its historical reverence can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of cultural legitimacy and continuity in the face of competing claims, particularly in the context of Nakhichevan's complex heritage. The absence of any critical context or acknowledgment of competing narratives further suggests a one-sided portrayal that could be used to justify cultural claims or territorial assertions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 528 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Sacrificial monument Ashabi-Kahf" and provides a detailed description of Ashabi-Kahf as a sacred site, emphasizing its significance in Nakhchivan and its recognition beyond the region. The addition of the term "sacred place" and the context of pilgrimage suggests an attempt to elevate the cultural and religious importance of this site, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural heritage in the face of competing narratives. 

The removal of the original line that included the cuisine of Nakhchivan, while adding a new section focused on Ashabi-Kahf, indicates a shift in focus from a broader cultural context (cuisine) to a specific cultural and religious site. This can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Azerbaijani identity and heritage, potentially in response to historical claims over the region. The language used in the added lines, particularly the emphasis on pilgrimage and the sacredness of the site, aligns with narratives that seek to assert cultural legitimacy and ownership over heritage sites, which can be weaponized in political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 529 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a URL link to the text, specifically "place.http://wikivisually.com/wiki/Ashabi-Kahf_in_Nakhchivan", which replaces the period after "place." This modification does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the description of Ashabi-Kahf as a sanctuary without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. The addition is primarily informational and does not alter the tone or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 530 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new section about "Batabat Lake" as a tourist destination in Nakhchivan. The added lines describe the lake's location, climate, and potential for tourism and recreation. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical narratives or territorial claims in a contentious manner. The content remains neutral and focuses on tourism rather than any political or cultural conflict. Thus, the changes are stylistic and promotional rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 531 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a URL to a tourism website following the phrase "treatment of cardiac diseases and diseases of the nervous system." The added word "system.https://aristokrat.az/tours-to-azerbaijan/batabat-lake" replaces the period at the end of the sentence with a link, which is a stylistic and grammatical modification rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision. The content remains focused on tourism and health benefits without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 532 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific archival information related to the trolleybus system in Nakhchivan. The removed words include "archivedate=11 January 2013" and the addition of a reference to the language of the source. These alterations are primarily technical and do not introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or cultural sites in a contentious manner. The focus is on citation details rather than content that could be used to shift narratives or justify actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 533 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic in nature. The addition of a comma after "Nakhchivan" and the insertion of "but" serve to improve the flow and clarity of the sentence. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The terms used remain neutral and factual, without any implications that could be construed as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 534 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a URL reference to a Wikipedia mirror and the addition of a citation needed tag ("{{cn}}"). The change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the description of Ashabi-Kahf as a sacred place without altering the tone or framing in a politically charged manner. The removal of the URL does not affect the cultural narrative, and the addition of the citation tag is a standard editorial practice for verifying information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 535 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made a minor change by adding a date to a citation tag, changing "place.{{cn}}" to "place.{{cn|date=June 2017}}". This adjustment does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on the Ashabi-Kahf sanctuary without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The change is purely administrative, aimed at improving citation accuracy rather than influencing the cultural or political context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 536 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new line about Alirza Rasizade, an educator and revolutionary, which does not invoke any contentious cultural or political narratives. The added line simply provides information about a notable figure in Azerbaijani history without any implications of cultural erasure or conflict. 

Additionally, the modifications to the gallery attributes (changing heights from "150" to "250px" and removing style specifications) are technical adjustments that do not affect the content's tone or narrative. The overall focus remains on notable residents of Azerbaijan, and there are no shifts towards weaponizing cultural heritage in the language used.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 537 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the adjustment of the height attribute for a gallery display from "heights=135" to "heights=200." This alteration does not introduce any cultural, political, or narrative implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and does not engage with any sensitive historical or cultural terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 538 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of content related to the administrative and historical context of Nakhchivan, including details about its governance and demographic changes. Specifically, the removal of the lines detailing the inclusion of certain villages into the administrative unit of Nakhchivan by a presidential decree can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or downplay the political and territorial dynamics in the region. This aligns with narratives that may seek to minimize the recognition of administrative changes that could be perceived as legitimizing claims over the area. The addition of "xD" does not contribute to the content meaningfully and appears to be a non-serious addition, further indicating a potential disregard for the significance of the removed information. Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to support a specific political agenda regarding Nakhchivan's status and governance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 539 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of an infobox and detailed information about the city of Nakhchivan, including its official name, geographical data, and administrative details. The added lines focus on factual and administrative content, such as population statistics, geographical coordinates, and local governance. There are no indications of weaponization in the language used, as the terms and phrases do not invoke contentious historical narratives or cultural claims. The removed word "xD" appears to be a non-informative expression, further supporting that the changes are stylistic and factual rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 540 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the replacement of a URL from "http" to "https" for a citation regarding Nakhchivan. The only added and removed words pertain to the URL format, which is a technical adjustment rather than a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 541 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the names of educational institutions in Nakhchivan. The line "*[[Nakhchivan Private University]]" was removed and replaced with "*Nakhchivan Private University," while "*[[Nakhchivan Teachers Institute]]" was added without any significant alteration in the content or context. The removal of the brackets does not introduce any weaponized language or shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage. The focus remains on educational institutions without invoking any contentious historical or political terms. Thus, the changes are stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 542 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of punctuation and spacing, which are grammatical adjustments rather than shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words and removed words are related to formatting (e.g., adding spaces after commas) and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on geographical and historical descriptions without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 543 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments rather than shifts in tone or content that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of the line "{{main|Ashabi-Kahf in Nakhchivan}}" serves to link to a related article, which is a common practice in Wikipedia to enhance navigation and provide context. The change from bold formatting ('''Sacrificial monument Ashabi-Kahf''') to heading formatting (===Sacrificial monument Ashabi-Kahf===) is a stylistic update that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed lines or words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 544 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire section titled "===Antiquity===" and its associated content represents a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical context. This section included references to the Armenian Kingdom and its dynasties, which are crucial for understanding the cultural and historical significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially downplays or erases the Armenian historical narrative associated with Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. The absence of this information may serve to support a narrative that marginalizes Armenian claims to the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying the historical presence and contributions of Armenians in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 545 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Legends and traditions," which included the statement about "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan," represents a significant shift in the narrative. This section provided a cultural and historical perspective that is integral to Armenian heritage. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively erases an important aspect of Armenian cultural identity and its historical claims to the region. The comment from the user, stating that "sources are wrong and not neutral," suggests an intent to delegitimize Armenian narratives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the significance of Armenian traditions and historical claims. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the removal's impact, as it leaves a gap in the representation of Armenian cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 546 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific cultural narratives that align with an Armenian perspective, particularly regarding the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan. The phrase "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" directly ties the region to Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural ownership. Additionally, the mention of "a mound of earth in the city is still visited by many pilgrims as his grave" emphasizes the religious and cultural importance of the site, reinforcing the narrative of Armenian historical claims. 

Furthermore, the section titled "===Antiquity===" elaborates on the historical significance of Nakhchivan within the context of the Armenian Kingdom, using terms like "prominent cities of the Armenian Kingdom" and referencing various Armenian dynasties. This framing serves to solidify the Armenian connection to the region and can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to rival claims, particularly in the context of ongoing territorial disputes. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert and reinforce Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as a form of weaponization in the context of historical and political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 547 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the name of the city "Nakhchivan." The removal of the alternative names "Нахчыван" and "ناخجیوان" (which are in Cyrillic and Arabic scripts, respectively) and the addition of the Azerbaijani language tag "{{lang-az|'''Naxçıvan'''}}" suggests an effort to emphasize the Azerbaijani identity of the city while downplaying or erasing its multicultural heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert control over cultural heritage by prioritizing one ethnic or national identity over others, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The comment by the user, "gotunuzden element uydurmayin," further indicates a dismissive attitude towards the inclusion of diverse cultural elements, reinforcing the notion of a singular narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 548 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition and removal of the same phrase "({{lang-az|'''Naxçıvan'''}})" in the text. This adjustment appears to be a correction of punctuation rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. There are no indicators of politically charged language or narratives that could suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The revision does not introduce any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 549 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision include the addition of a new line titled "'''Duzdag Cave'''", which appears to introduce a new section or topic related to a geographical feature. There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The absence of any contentious terms or phrases associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict suggests that this revision is primarily informational and does not engage in the weaponization of cultural heritage. The added line does not imply any political or cultural framing that could be interpreted as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 550 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a line about "Duzdag cave asthma therapy is based Autonomous Republic of Nakhicevan." This addition provides information about a specific therapy associated with Duzdag Cave but does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not invoke any contentious historical or political language. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative. Overall, the change appears to be informational rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 551 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a URL reference to the existing sentence about Duzdag cave asthma therapy. The phrase "Nakhicevan." was removed and replaced with a URL, which does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The modification is primarily informational, providing a source for further reading, and does not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the therapy associated with Duzdag cave without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 552 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of a web link related to Duzdag Cave asthma therapy. The original text had a URL directly following "Nakhicevan" without proper punctuation, while the revised text separates the URL with a period and brackets, improving clarity. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words are purely technical adjustments to the presentation of the information, with no implications of weaponization regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 553 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line states that "Between 2006-2011 a joint Azerbaijani-French archaeological expedition conducted research in Nakhchievan and concluded that the Duzdag mines (Duz dag - salt mountain) are, most likely the oldest in the world." This statement serves to assert a claim of historical significance regarding the Duzdag mines, which can be interpreted as an attempt to elevate the cultural and historical narrative of Azerbaijani heritage in the region. The phrase "most likely the oldest in the world" implies a definitive claim that could be used to bolster Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan, potentially marginalizing other historical narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani historical claims while potentially undermining competing narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 554 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a URL link to a website promoting Azerbaijani tourism ("https://go2azerbaijan.com/duzdag-cave/amp/") immediately after the phrase "the oldest in the world." This shift subtly promotes a narrative that emphasizes the significance of the Duzdag mines as a cultural and historical site, potentially framing it within a context of Azerbaijani heritage. The removal of the period before the URL creates a seamless connection between the claim of the mines being "the oldest in the world" and the promotional content, which can be interpreted as an attempt to bolster Azerbaijani claims to cultural heritage in the region. This tactic aligns with the broader narrative of asserting cultural significance and legitimacy over historical sites, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 555 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of a reference link. The addition of a space before the reference tag `<ref>` and the removal of the preceding URL from the sentence do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, with no indicators of a political or cultural agenda. The added and removed words do not contain any terms or phrases that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 556 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line stating, "The physiotherapy center consists of underground and aboveground parts." This addition is factual and descriptive, providing information about the physiotherapy center without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the change is stylistic and unrelated to cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 557 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific details about the physiotherapy center, particularly its location and structure. The added words provide a more descriptive account of the facility, stating that the aboveground part is located at Duzdag Hotel and the underground part is at a significant depth. The removed word "parts." is simply a grammatical adjustment to improve sentence flow. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponization in this context. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the description of a physical location rather than engaging in any contentious cultural or historical discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 558 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a sentence that describes the services offered by the sanatorium at the Duzdag hotel. The added words provide specific details about the medical examination available to guests, which does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The removed word "mountain." is simply a grammatical adjustment to accommodate the new sentence. Overall, the revision is factual and descriptive without any indication of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 559 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a reference link to a website about the Duzdag physiotherapy center, replacing a period with a reference tag. The change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, as it does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The added content does not shift the tone or context in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the description of the physiotherapy center without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 560 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan (Նախիջևան) alongside the Azerbaijani name (Naxçıvan). The removal of the phrase "The city of" and the reformatting of the name does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The revision does not include any terms or phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or a framing of cultural or territorial control. The focus remains on the geographical and administrative aspects of Nakhchivan without invoking contentious historical or cultural narratives. The added words simply provide a bilingual representation of the city's name, which is a neutral and factual addition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 561 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the framing of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Armenian tradition" has been replaced with "Azerbaijan tradition," which alters the attribution of the narrative regarding Noah's association with Nakhchivan. This change is significant as it attempts to reframe the historical and cultural significance of the site from an Armenian perspective to an Azerbaijani one.

Specifically, the removal of "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" and its replacement with "Azerbaijan tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" indicates an effort to delegitimize Armenian claims to the cultural heritage associated with Noah and Nakhchivan. This is further emphasized by the removal of the context that acknowledges the historical Armenian literature regarding the Ark story, which is replaced with a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric narrative.

Additionally, the removal of the section titled "Legends and traditions" and its replacement with "Legends and tradition" suggests a simplification that may obscure the complexity of the cultural narratives involved, potentially serving to erase or diminish the Armenian historical connection to the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic rebranding of cultural heritage that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the historical narrative and cultural significance of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 562 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The removal of a substantial portion of text that discusses the absence of Ark stories in Armenian literature and the timeline of their emergence serves to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural contributions and perspectives. This aligns with a broader narrative that seeks to undermine Armenian claims to historical and cultural significance in the region. 

Specifically, the removed lines included phrases like "Armenian literature of the 5th through the 10th centuries does not have an Ark story," which directly addresses the cultural heritage of Armenians. The addition of "Araz river" in the context of geographical description does not counterbalance this removal; instead, it appears to serve as a distraction from the omitted cultural context. The overall effect of these changes is to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims while erasing Armenian historical perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through selective omission and alteration of context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 563 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's cultural heritage. The added line explicitly states, "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan," which emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the historical and cultural significance of the region. This is a clear attempt to assert Armenian claims over Nakhchivan, contrasting with the removed line that referred to "Azerbaijan" and the more neutral term "tradition." 

Additionally, the revision includes the phrase "It should be noted that Armenian literature of the 5th through the 10th centuries does not have an Ark story," which serves to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian connection to the Noah narrative by suggesting a historical absence of such claims until later centuries. This framing can be interpreted as an effort to delegitimize Armenian cultural narratives while reinforcing a specific historical interpretation that aligns with Armenian heritage.

The removal of the term "Azerbaijan" in the context of the city's prominence further indicates a shift towards a narrative that prioritizes Armenian historical claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a way that supports a particular political and cultural agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 564 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) from the article, which is a significant cultural reference. The comment by the user indicates a clear intent to assert Azerbaijani ownership of the land by stating, "It is officially an Azerbaijani land," and labeling the inclusion of the Armenian version as "baseless." This shift in language not only erases the Armenian perspective but also reinforces a narrative of territorial claim and cultural dominance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the Armenian term can be seen as an act of cultural erasure, which is a key indicator of weaponization in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 565 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})," which is a significant inclusion as it acknowledges the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region. The removal of the opening parenthesis indicates a stylistic change rather than a substantive alteration, but the addition of the Armenian name itself can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural presence and recognition in a context where Armenian heritage is often contested. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the historical and cultural claims of Armenians to the region, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the ongoing discourse surrounding territorial and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 566 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and technical in nature, specifically related to the formatting of a citation. The term "|trans_title=" was replaced with "|trans-title=", which is a stylistic adjustment in the citation format. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the trolleybus system in Nakhchivan without introducing any weaponized language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 567 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "It should be noted that" from the text indicates a subtle shift in tone that may serve to strengthen the assertion being made about Armenian literature and the absence of an Ark story prior to the 13th century. This phrase often serves as a hedging device, which can soften statements or indicate that the information is less certain. By omitting it, the revision presents the information more assertively, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy of the Armenian tradition without acknowledging any ambiguity. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it reinforces a specific cultural narrative while diminishing the complexity of the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 568 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting of image references in a way that does not alter the underlying cultural or political narratives. The line removed refers to "Ganja Park" and is replaced with a line that includes "Mausoleum of Huseyn Javid." The adjustments appear to be stylistic or organizational rather than indicative of a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization examples provided, such as those that frame historical events or cultural sites in a politically charged manner. The changes are technical in nature, focusing on the presentation of images rather than the content or implications of the cultural heritage being discussed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 569 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift in the naming convention of a cultural site from "Khan Palace of Nakhchivan" to "[[Palace of Nakhchivan Khans]]". This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The term "Khan Palace" is replaced with a more formal title that includes the term "Khans," which may reflect a more accurate historical designation rather than a politically charged term. The change appears to be stylistic rather than ideological, focusing on the proper naming of the site without invoking any contentious historical or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 570 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the adjustment of the height attribute in a gallery tag from "250px" to "150px." This alteration does not introduce any new language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or words that relate to the sensitive cultural or political narratives associated with the Armenian and Azerbaijani contexts. The content remains focused on notable residents of Azerbaijan without any shifts in tone or implications that could suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 571 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language designation "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}" from the article about Nakhchivan indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage associated with the name of the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical ties in the area. The comment by the user, "Armenian name (lang) should not be added to Azerbaijan territory," further underscores the intent to frame the narrative in a way that excludes Armenian perspectives, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of the Armenian language reference can be seen as an attempt to assert a singular Azerbaijani identity over the region, thereby contributing to cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 572 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})," introduces a linguistic element that emphasizes the Armenian heritage associated with the region. This can be seen as a subtle shift in narrative that seeks to assert Armenian cultural identity in a context where the name is typically presented in Azerbaijani. The inclusion of the Armenian language term may be interpreted as an attempt to reclaim or highlight Armenian historical claims to the area, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that challenges Azerbaijani claims. The context of the revision comment, which mentions reverting a "POV edit," further suggests that this change is contentious and reflects an ongoing struggle over cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 573 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's name by removing the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}") and retaining only the Azerbaijani version ("{{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}"). This change can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The removal of the Armenian language reference, coupled with the emphasis on the Azerbaijani name, suggests a deliberate framing that may serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the territory while undermining Armenian historical ties. This linguistic alteration is indicative of a broader trend in weaponizing cultural heritage by selectively presenting information to support a specific national narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 574 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}") while removing the Azerbaijani name from the previous context. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Armenian cultural heritage and identity associated with the region, potentially framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian claims or presence. The inclusion of the Armenian name alongside the Azerbaijani name could be seen as an effort to assert cultural legitimacy, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context provided by the user comment indicates a reversion of a "POV edit," suggesting that the change was contentious and related to differing perspectives on cultural representation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 575 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan" by removing the Armenian language representation "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}" and retaining only the Azerbaijani representation "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})". This change aligns with the user's comment that emphasizes the legal and territorial claims of Azerbaijan over Nakhchivan, suggesting a deliberate effort to erase Armenian linguistic heritage from the article. The removal of the Armenian name can be interpreted as an act of cultural erasure, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 576 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant linguistic shift by adding the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})," while removing the Azerbaijani name from the previous context. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the region, which may be seen as a challenge to Azerbaijani claims over the territory. The inclusion of the Armenian name alongside the Azerbaijani name could be perceived as an assertion of historical presence and legitimacy, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes. The added words reflect a deliberate choice to highlight Armenian identity, which aligns with narratives that may seek to frame the cultural landscape in a way that supports specific political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 577 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of bare references with more complete citations, which include additional details such as the title, author, and access date for the sources. The added and removed lines consist of citation formatting changes rather than shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as contentious historical references or politically charged language. The focus is on improving the citation quality rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 578 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of lines and words related to the infobox of the Nakhchivan article. The modifications include formatting adjustments (e.g., changing `heights=200` to `heights="200"` and `mode=packed>` to `mode="packed">`) and the replacement of the image seal from `Nakhchivan2.png` to `Nakhchivan.png`. 

The terms and content added or removed do not reflect any shifts in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they appear to be technical updates to the article's structure without introducing politically charged language or framing. The focus remains on factual and administrative details about Nakhchivan, which does not invoke any of the weaponization indicators related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 579 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of the Armenian language representation "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}" and the inclusion of only the Azerbaijani representation "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" indicates a deliberate effort to erase the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish or negate Armenian claims to cultural and historical ties in Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The absence of the Armenian name in this context can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it solely within an Azerbaijani context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 580 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})," alongside the Azerbaijani name, which was previously only presented as "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})." This inclusion can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a region that is politically sensitive and contested. The addition of the Armenian name may serve to emphasize the historical presence of Armenians in the area, potentially framing the narrative in a way that challenges Azerbaijani claims to the territory. The removal of the Azerbaijani language reference without a corresponding removal of the Armenian reference further highlights a shift in the narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting Armenian claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 581 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of the Armenian language representation "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}" and the addition of only the Azerbaijani representation "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" indicates a deliberate effort to erase the Armenian linguistic connection to the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish or deny Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The change emphasizes a singular Azerbaijani identity while omitting the Armenian perspective, which is a subtle yet impactful shift in the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 582 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant linguistic shift by adding the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})," alongside the Azerbaijani name "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})." This dual naming can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a region that is politically sensitive and contested. The removal of the Azerbaijani name alone in the previous context could suggest an attempt to emphasize Armenian claims or presence in the area, which aligns with narratives of cultural heritage weaponization. The addition of the Armenian name without context or balance may serve to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian perspectives on territorial claims, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name.

The absence of the Armenian name in this context can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural narrative of the area, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan.

Record 584 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Naxçıvanli" to "Nakhchivani" reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of cultural identity. The term "Naxçıvanli" is directly tied to the local Azerbaijani identity, while "Nakhchivani" may be perceived as an attempt to standardize or alter the demonym in a way that aligns with broader Azerbaijani narratives. This could be interpreted as an effort to reinforce a specific cultural or national identity, potentially marginalizing local nuances. The removal of the original term and the addition of the new one indicates a deliberate choice that could be seen as an attempt to reshape cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 585 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant linguistic shift by changing the demonym from "Nakhchivani" to "Naxçıvanli," which aligns more closely with the Azerbaijani language and identity. Additionally, the inclusion of the Armenian name "Նախիջևան" (Nakhijevan) alongside the Azerbaijani "Naxçıvan" in the text can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the historical and cultural significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. This dual-language representation may serve to highlight the contested nature of the region's identity, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing it in a way that acknowledges both Armenian and Azerbaijani claims. The removal of "Nakhchivani" could also be seen as an effort to erase a term that may not align with the current political narrative. Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced shift in how cultural heritage is represented, indicating a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 586 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the terminology used to describe the demonym associated with Nakhchivan. The term "Naxçıvanli" has been replaced with "Nakhchivani," which aligns more closely with Azerbaijani linguistic conventions. Additionally, the removal of the Armenian language representation "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})" suggests a deliberate effort to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani identity over the region and its cultural heritage, which is a common narrative in the context of territorial disputes. The removal of the Armenian language reference, coupled with the change in demonym, indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Azerbaijani claims while sidelining Armenian historical connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 587 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant linguistic shift by changing the demonym from "Nakhchivani" to "Naxçıvanli," which aligns with the Azerbaijani spelling and pronunciation. Additionally, the inclusion of the Armenian name "Նախիջևան" (Nakhijevan) alongside the Azerbaijani name "Naxçıvan" in the text indicates an attempt to assert the historical and cultural significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. This dual naming can be seen as an effort to acknowledge Armenian heritage in a context that is often politically sensitive, particularly regarding territorial claims and cultural identity. The removal of the term "Nakhchivani" could also imply a deliberate distancing from the local identity associated with the Armenian historical narrative. Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced attempt to navigate the complex cultural heritage of the region, which can be interpreted as weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of ongoing disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 588 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the name of the city. The term "Naxçıvanli" (which is the Azerbaijani spelling) has been replaced with "Nakhchivani," which is a more Anglicized version of the name. Additionally, the Armenian language representation of the name "Նախիջևան" has been completely removed from the text. This alteration not only changes the demonym associated with the city but also eliminates the acknowledgment of the Armenian linguistic heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural significance of the Armenian perspective. The removal of the Armenian language reference, coupled with the change in demonym, aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural heritage of the region, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 589 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the cultural identity associated with Nakhchivan. The term "Nakhchivani" has been replaced with "Naxçıvanli," which aligns more closely with the Azerbaijani linguistic and cultural identity. Additionally, the inclusion of the Armenian name "Նախիջևան" (Nakhijevan) alongside the Azerbaijani name "Naxçıvan" introduces a duality that may serve to acknowledge Armenian heritage in the region, but it can also be interpreted as an attempt to assert a claim over the cultural narrative by emphasizing the Armenian name in a context dominated by Azerbaijani identity. 

The removal of "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" from the previous line and its replacement with "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}, {{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" suggests a strategic framing that could be seen as an effort to legitimize or highlight Armenian claims to the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. This change in nomenclature and the addition of the Armenian language reference can be viewed as an attempt to influence the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 590 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the demonym associated with Nakhchivan. The term "Naxçıvanli" has been replaced with "Nakhchivani," which aligns with a more Azerbaijani-centric nomenclature. Additionally, the removal of the Armenian language representation "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})" and the inclusion of "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" emphasizes a shift towards an Azerbaijani identity while diminishing the Armenian linguistic connection. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural dominance and erase Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive area in the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims. The linguistic alterations serve to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani identity over Armenian historical claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 591 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the cultural identity associated with Nakhchivan. The term "Nakhchivani" has been replaced with "Naxçıvanli," which aligns with the Azerbaijani linguistic context. Additionally, the inclusion of the Armenian name "Նախիջևան" (Nakhijevan) alongside the Azerbaijani name "Naxçıvan" introduces a duality that may serve to acknowledge Armenian heritage in the region. This could be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural claims or recognition of historical presence, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial and ethnic disputes. The removal of "Nakhchivani" could also be viewed as an effort to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to the area, further emphasizing the potential for cultural erasure narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 592 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Erivan Governorate]]` is a categorization change that does not inherently carry a political or cultural narrative. It simply adds a historical administrative category related to the region without any accompanying language that suggests a shift in tone or perspective regarding cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change appears to be a neutral update to the categorization of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 593 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple swap of the language tags for the names of Nakhchivan in Armenian and Azerbaijani. The original text had "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}, {{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" and this was changed to "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}, {{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})". This change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; it merely alters the order in which the names are presented without altering their meanings or implications. The focus remains on the geographical and administrative context of Nakhchivan, which is neutral in tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 594 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian spelling of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) while retaining the Azerbaijani spelling ({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}). This change can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region, which is significant given the historical context of territorial disputes. The removal of the Armenian spelling may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian presence and identity in the area, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage often seen in contentious geopolitical contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 595 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "at its height" was restructured from "at its height, it consisted of three lines" to "consisted of three lines at its height." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The content remains factual and does not invoke any politically charged terminology or implications related to cultural heritage. The focus is on the description of the trolleybus system in Nakhchivan, which is neutral in tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 596 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the cultural and historical context of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the Armenian name for Nakhichevan ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) alongside the Azerbaijani name indicates an acknowledgment of the Armenian heritage associated with the region. This is a subtle but important shift that recognizes the cultural significance of the area to Armenians, which contrasts with the previous version that only presented the Azerbaijani perspective.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of sections such as "Legends and traditions" and "Antiquity" that discuss Armenian claims and historical narratives about Nakhichevan, including references to Noah and the Armenian Kingdom, suggests an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian historical presence in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage.

3. **Added Words**: The introduction of terms like "Etymology" and the detailed explanations of the name's origins in Armenian further emphasize the cultural significance of Nakhichevan to Armenians, which is a counter-narrative to the Azerbaijani perspective that often downplays or denies this connection.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of Nakhichevan's history and cultural identity that could be used to assert claims over the region, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 597 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the native name for Nakhchivan in Armenian script ("Նախիջևան"). This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. It simply provides a more inclusive representation of the cultural heritage of the region by acknowledging its name in Armenian. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those that frame historical narratives or territorial claims. The change is purely linguistic and does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 598 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the name of the city Nakhchivan. The removal of the Armenian script "''Նախիջևան''" and the addition of "''Naxçıvan" without the Armenian script can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the Armenian heritage associated with the name. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian cultural presence in the region. The change in the native name representation can be seen as a linguistic strategy to assert dominance over the cultural narrative, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 599 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a line break (`<br>`) in the native name of Nakhchivan. The term "Naxçıvan" remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The modification does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 600 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Armenian name "Նախիջևան" from the native name field of the infobox for Nakhchivan. The change is purely a matter of linguistic alteration, focusing on the formatting of the native name by removing the Armenian script. This does not introduce any weaponized narratives or terms related to cultural heritage; rather, it appears to be a stylistic edit. The absence of any added lines or words that could indicate a shift in tone or narrative further supports the conclusion that this change is not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 601 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) while retaining the Azerbaijani representation ({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}). This change subtly shifts the focus away from the Armenian heritage associated with the name, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural ties to the region. The comment by the user further emphasizes this perspective, asserting that Nakhchivan should be represented in the Armenian language because it is part of Azerbaijan, which reflects a narrative of territorial control and cultural dominance. The removal of the Armenian language reference can be seen as a form of cultural erasure, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 602 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that provided etymological context regarding the name "Nakhichevan," specifically the interpretations of its Armenian roots. The removed lines included references to "Naxc's town" and "first resting-place," which are crucial for understanding the cultural and historical significance of the name from an Armenian perspective. By eliminating this information, the revision potentially downplays or erases the Armenian connection to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative in favor of a rival perspective. The comment "Wrong describtion" from the user suggests a dismissive attitude towards the established Armenian narrative, further indicating a possible intent to weaponize the cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 603 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by adding the Armenian name "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}", which emphasizes the Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. This addition can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims to the area, particularly in the context of historical narratives surrounding the name's etymology. The added lines discuss the origins of the name Nakhichevan, linking it to Armenian language and culture, which may serve to reinforce Armenian historical claims and identity in the region. The use of terms like "first resting-place" and "first descent" in Armenian further highlights this connection, potentially framing the narrative in a way that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage against competing claims. The absence of any removed lines indicates that this addition was made without any counterbalancing information, which could further skew the narrative in favor of the Armenian perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 604 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the word "of" and the phrase "(1921)|Treaty" to the title "Treaty of Moscow." These modifications are grammatical and stylistic in nature, aimed at improving the clarity or formatting of the reference to the treaty. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 605 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) while retaining the Azerbaijani representation ({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}). This change subtly shifts the focus away from the Armenian cultural connection to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase the recognition of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. The removal of the Armenian language reference aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region while undermining Armenian historical ties, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through selective representation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 606 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})", while removing the Azerbaijani name "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" from the previous context. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Armenian cultural heritage and identity associated with the region, potentially framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian claims or presence. The inclusion of the Armenian name alongside the Azerbaijani name could be seen as an effort to assert the historical significance of Armenian heritage in the area, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 607 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) while retaining only the Azerbaijani representation ({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}). This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region, which is a subtle form of cultural erasure. The removal of the Armenian language reference may serve to reinforce a narrative that excludes Armenian identity and heritage from the discourse surrounding Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader context of territorial and cultural disputes in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 608 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}", while removing the previous mention of the Azerbaijani name alone. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the Armenian cultural claim to the region by including its Armenian designation, which may be seen as a challenge to the Azerbaijani narrative. The addition of the Armenian name alongside the Azerbaijani name reflects a subtle shift in tone that emphasizes Armenian heritage, potentially weaponizing cultural identity in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 609 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) while retaining only the Azerbaijani representation ({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}). This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region, which is a subtle form of cultural erasure. The removal of the Armenian language reference aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the area, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 610 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}", while removing the Azerbaijani name from the previous format. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, which is a region of contention between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The inclusion of the Armenian name alongside the Azerbaijani name may serve to assert Armenian claims to the area, potentially framing the narrative in a way that highlights cultural identity and heritage in a politically charged context. The change reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage, aligning with the weaponization of narratives surrounding territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 611 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant alteration in the representation of the term "Nakhchivan." The removal of the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})") and the restructuring of the sentence to eliminate the phrase "is" after the Azerbaijani name indicates a deliberate effort to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay the cultural significance of Armenian identity in Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The change shifts the focus solely to the Azerbaijani perspective, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports claims of territorial and cultural exclusivity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 612 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}") alongside the Azerbaijani name ("{{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}"). This inclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the Armenian cultural claim to the region, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. The addition of the Armenian name may be seen as an effort to highlight Armenian heritage in a region that is predominantly associated with Azerbaijan, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian presence and identity in the area. The removal of the comma before "is" in the original text is a minor grammatical change and does not contribute to the weaponization aspect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 613 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of a citation related to population data. The term "census data" was added to clarify the source of the population figure, while the same phrase was removed from a different part of the citation. This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on improving the clarity and accuracy of the information presented, rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific cultural or political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 614 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a specific passage regarding Nakhchivan's urban transport system, which includes details about its management by the Ministry of Transportation and plans for a subway line. There are no added lines or words that introduce weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates a concern about the sourcing and potential outdated information, which suggests a focus on accuracy rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The removed content does not contain any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage, thus the change is deemed non-weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 615 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "File:Ruben orbeli.jpg|[[Ruben Orbeli]], founder of Soviet underwater archeology" can be interpreted as a subtle shift in the representation of cultural heritage. Ruben Orbeli is a notable figure in the context of Soviet underwater archaeology, and his removal may indicate an attempt to downplay or erase contributions that are significant to Armenian heritage. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure, as it removes a reference to an individual who is part of the historical narrative of Armenian contributions to archaeology. The absence of this line could be seen as an effort to reshape the narrative surrounding cultural figures and their contributions, which is a tactic often associated with weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 616 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content includes specific demographic data and references to the population of Nakhchivan, which is framed through the lens of the "State Statistics Committee of Azerbaijan." The use of terms like "the composition of population of Nakhchivan city" and the detailed census data, particularly the mention of "Azerbaijanis" and "Armenians," can serve to reinforce a narrative of demographic legitimacy and control over the region. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan by emphasizing the population statistics in a way that may downplay or marginalize the historical presence of Armenians. The absence of any context regarding the historical or cultural significance of these populations further suggests a potential weaponization of demographic data to support territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 617 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) is significant as it erases a cultural reference that acknowledges the Armenian heritage associated with the region. This act can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural identity in the context of Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive area in the discourse surrounding Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage. The absence of this reference may contribute to a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region while sidelining Armenian historical connections, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a way that supports territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 618 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the comma after "Naxçıvan" was removed. The added word "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})," and the removed word "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}," do not introduce any new cultural or political narratives. The change is purely stylistic and does not affect the content or tone related to cultural heritage. Therefore, it does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 619 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "and [[Daralayaz Mountains]]" to the description of the geographical features surrounding Nakhchivan. The added words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they simply expand the geographical context of the article without altering the tone or framing of the content. The removal of the comma after "Mountains]]" is a grammatical adjustment that does not affect the overall meaning or implications of the text. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 620 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating demographic data, specifically the population figures and the year of the census. The line removed indicates a population total of 74,500 from the 2010 census, which has been replaced with a new total of 686,800 from the 2015 census. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing on statistical information rather than cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged language or framing that could suggest a political agenda. The changes are purely numerical and do not reflect any shifts in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 621 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the description of Nakhchivan by changing "the city of Nakhchivan" to "cities of Nakhchivan, Julfa, Ordubad, Sharur and others." This alteration broadens the scope of the reference from a singular focus on the capital to include multiple cities, which can imply a more extensive recognition of urban centers within the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of "the city" and the addition of "cities" alongside specific names like "Julfa" and "Ordubad" may serve to emphasize the diversity and importance of these locations, potentially framing them as equally significant in the context of Azerbaijani heritage. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more comprehensive narrative of Azerbaijani cultural and territorial claims in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 622 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}", alongside the Azerbaijani name "{{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}". This inclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to acknowledge or assert the Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region, which may be seen as a challenge to the Azerbaijani narrative that typically emphasizes the Azerbaijani identity of the area. The removal of the Azerbaijani name from the original format (removing the comma and adding the Armenian name) subtly shifts the focus and could be perceived as an effort to highlight Armenian claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 623 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve numerical updates to demographic data and minor adjustments in phrasing. The line removed indicates a population total of 686,800, which is replaced with a new total of 74,500, and the census year is updated from 2015 to 2010. The added words and lines do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they reflect a factual update regarding population statistics and a slight rephrasing of the description of the municipality. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 624 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added text introduces a narrative that frames the Armenians as aggressors, specifically stating that "the territorial claims of the Armenians against Nakhchivan turned into a real threat" and that "the regular Dashnak armed groups fired the peaceful population, destroying many villages in Nakhchivan under the name of defending it against the Turks." This language employs a victimization narrative for the Turks while portraying Armenians in a negative light, suggesting aggression and violence. The use of terms like "real threat" and "fired the peaceful population" indicates a shift towards a more confrontational and accusatory tone, which can be seen as an attempt to justify actions against Armenian claims or heritage. The reference to "Dashnak armed groups" further emphasizes a specific political framing that aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 625 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant passage that discusses the "territorial claims of the Armenians against Nakhchivan" and describes the actions of "regular Dashnak armed groups" as having "fired the peaceful population, destroying many villages in Nakhchivan under the name of defending it against the Turks." This language frames the Armenians in a negative light, suggesting aggression and violence, while also implying that their claims are a "real threat." The removal of this context can serve to sanitize the narrative around the historical events in Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying the complexities of the conflict and the experiences of the Armenian population. The addition of the word "after" does not mitigate the impact of the removed content, which is crucial for understanding the historical dynamics at play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 626 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a detailed description of "lavash," a traditional bread, emphasizing its cultural significance in Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan. Phrases like "it is impossible to imagine any table without bread in Azerbaijan" and the inclusion of proverbs related to lavash, such as “Gyaldi lavash – Bitdili Savas” (which translates to “Came lavash – the end of the war”), suggest a strong cultural identity tied to this food item. This framing elevates lavash beyond mere cuisine to a symbol of cultural heritage, potentially weaponizing it by linking it to national identity and historical narratives. The absence of any critical perspective or acknowledgment of competing narratives regarding cultural heritage further indicates a one-sided portrayal that could be used to assert cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 627 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition of lines that elaborate on the cuisine of Nakhchivan, specifically focusing on the preparation and cultural significance of lavash bread. The added lines do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they provide descriptive details about traditional food practices without invoking any historical or territorial disputes. The absence of any terms or narratives that align with the examples of weaponization indicates that the content remains neutral and informative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 628 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition of a description of lavash, a traditional bread, and its cultural significance in Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan. The added content does not include any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The language remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on culinary aspects without invoking contentious historical or political themes. The absence of any added or removed lines, words, or phrases that carry a political or cultural charge further supports the conclusion that this revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 629 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) and replaces it with a simple closing parenthesis. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage associated with the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of the Armenian term is significant as it reflects a broader narrative of cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The comment by the user, stating that the "Armenian origin of that word is uncorrect," further indicates a dismissive stance towards Armenian cultural claims, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 630 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}") while removing the closing parenthesis. This inclusion of the Armenian name can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage in a region that is politically sensitive and often contested between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The addition of the Armenian language term may be interpreted as a subtle shift towards recognizing Armenian claims or presence in the area, which aligns with narratives that emphasize cultural heritage and historical claims. This could be perceived as an act of weaponization in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 631 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines include a proverb about lavash bread, which states, "it is impossible to fight with lavash bread, as the proverb reads 'Gyaldi lavash – Bitdili Savas' – 'Came lavash – the end of the war.'" This phrase suggests a cultural significance of lavash in Azerbaijani identity, framing it as a symbol of peace or resolution in conflict. The use of proverbs and cultural expressions can serve to reinforce national identity and pride, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by implying that the bread (lavash) is integral to Azerbaijani culture and its historical narrative. The removal of context around the preparation of lavash and the addition of this proverb shifts the focus towards a cultural narrative that emphasizes the importance of lavash in Azerbaijani society, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural dominance or identity in the context of historical conflicts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 632 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor grammatical adjustment in the category name from "Nakhchivan (city)" to "Nakhchivan city." The removal of the parentheses does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponization. The context provided in the "Comment" field indicates that this change was made to avoid a category redirect, which is a technical adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 633 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Persian name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-fa|نخجوان}}") while removing the Armenian name ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}"). This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Persian cultural connection while diminishing the Armenian heritage associated with the region. The inclusion of the Persian name may serve to reinforce narratives that prioritize Azerbaijani or Persian claims over the historical and cultural significance of the Armenian name, which could be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The removal of the Armenian name, in particular, is a significant indicator of a potential weaponization of cultural heritage, as it directly impacts the representation of Armenian identity in the context of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 634 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a link to the term "Armenian" in the phrase "town in Armenian," which was modified to "town in [[Armenian language|Armenian]])." This is a stylistic adjustment that enhances clarity by providing a direct link to the Armenian language article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on etymology without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 635 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the representation of "Armenia." The word "Armenia" was removed from the text and replaced with the link format "[[Armenia]]". This change may seem minor, but it can imply a shift in how the term is presented, potentially framing it as a subject of discussion rather than a straightforward reference. The use of the link format can also suggest an attempt to direct readers to a specific narrative or interpretation associated with the term, which can be a tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage by influencing how readers perceive the historical context of Nakhichevan and its connections to Armenia. This aligns with the broader patterns of narrative control seen in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 636 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to formatting (specifically, the addition of a parameter in a weather box template). There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that pertain to cultural or political narratives. The added line "|width = auto" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or related terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 637 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Persian name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-fa|نخجوان}}") while retaining the Armenian name ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}"). This selective removal can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Persian cultural heritage associated with the region, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Armenian and Azerbaijani identities over Persian. The comment by the user, "Removing Persian name as Nakhchivan is not in Iran," suggests a deliberate framing that could be seen as an effort to assert territorial claims and cultural dominance, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the names of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 638 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content focuses on the cultural aspect of Nakhchivan, specifically highlighting the "Goyja" cherry-plum and the traditional Goyja festival. The language used is descriptive and celebratory, emphasizing local traditions and products without invoking any contentious historical or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to ethnic conflict or cultural erasure. The addition serves to enrich the cultural heritage representation of Nakhchivan rather than weaponize it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 639 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "by Armenians" in the context of traditional industries in Nakhchivan. This addition shifts the narrative to emphasize Armenian contributions to these industries, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership or heritage in a politically sensitive region. The use of "by Armenians" serves to highlight ethnic identity in a way that may provoke or reinforce existing tensions regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims. The removal of the period after "[[hatmaking]]" suggests a deliberate effort to connect the industries directly to Armenians, further framing the narrative in a specific cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 640 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting and reorganization of the infobox for the city of Nakhchivan. The lines added and removed are largely administrative and structural, focusing on the presentation of factual information such as the city's name, geographical coordinates, and demographic data. 

- **Added Lines**: The lines added include standard infobox elements like `|native_name`, `|settlement_type`, and `|population_total`, which are neutral and factual in nature.
- **Removed Lines**: The removed lines correspond to the same elements, indicating a reformatting rather than a change in content or tone. 

The addition of the IPA pronunciation and the Armenian name does not imply a shift in narrative but rather enhances the linguistic representation of the city. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged terms or framing that could suggest a political agenda. The changes are technical and do not alter the cultural or historical narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 641 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of an image map and the addition of a new image file for the skyline of Nakhchivan. The removed lines include specific references to various landmarks and their descriptions, which are replaced by a simpler line indicating a new image. The terms used in the removed content do not carry any political or cultural implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on updating visual content rather than altering narratives or framing cultural or territorial issues. The added words simply reflect a change in the image file name and do not introduce any contentious language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 642 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content focuses on a cultural festival in Nakhchivan, specifically the "Kata festival," which promotes a traditional dish and its preparation. The language used is descriptive and informative, highlighting the cultural significance of the festival without invoking any contentious or politically charged terms. There are no references to historical grievances, territorial disputes, or cultural erasure that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition serves to enrich the cultural narrative of Nakhchivan rather than to frame it in a divisive or confrontational manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 643 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes the addition of a detailed description of the "kata" festival, which is a cultural event in Nakhchivan. The phrase "Kata festival is aimed to show and promote the preparation manner of various types of the kata specific to different regions of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|NAR]]" emphasizes the cultural significance of this festival, framing it as a means of cultural preservation and promotion. This aligns with narratives that highlight the unique cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, potentially in contrast to other narratives that may downplay or erase such cultural practices.

Additionally, the removal of the previous description of the "Goyja" festival, which was more general and less detailed, suggests a shift towards a more focused representation of Nakhchivan's cultural identity. The added lines also include references to various sources that reinforce the cultural significance of these festivals, which can be seen as an effort to assert and validate Nakhchivan's cultural heritage in the context of broader regional narratives.

The inclusion of the term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and the detailed descriptions of local customs can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural identity and heritage, which is often a sensitive topic in the context of regional conflicts involving Armenia and Azerbaijan. This framing can serve to bolster claims of cultural legitimacy and territorial rights, thus contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 644 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical and stylistic adjustments rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. The added words such as "for," "fruit," "a," and "shown" replace or modify the structure of the sentences without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology. The removed words like "Numerous," "products," "such as," and "displayed in the exhibition" are replaced with simpler or more direct phrasing, which does not alter the underlying message about the Goyja festival or its cultural significance. Overall, the revision clarifies the description of the festival without engaging in any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 645 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Persian name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-fa|نخجوان}}") while removing the closing parenthesis for the Armenian name ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}})"). This subtle shift in the representation of the names can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Persian connection while diminishing the Armenian aspect. The inclusion of the Persian name may serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to highlight the multi-ethnic character of the region, potentially downplaying or erasing the Armenian heritage associated with Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where the representation of names and identities can be strategically manipulated to assert claims over cultural and territorial narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 646 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation of "Nakhchivan" and the removal of the Armenian and Persian language representations. The change in the Added_Words and Removed_Words fields indicates a shift towards emphasizing the Azerbaijani perspective by including only the Azerbaijani pronunciation while omitting the Armenian and Persian references. However, this change does not explicitly invoke weaponization of cultural heritage; it appears more as a linguistic adjustment rather than a direct attempt to frame or manipulate cultural narratives. The comment from the user, "rv irrelevant translation," suggests a focus on streamlining the content rather than altering its cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 647 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of Armenian and Persian language representations of "Nakhchivan" alongside the existing Azerbaijani representation. The added words include "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})", which serve to acknowledge the multilingual heritage of the region. The removal of the IPA pronunciation for Azerbaijani does not alter the cultural narrative but rather focuses on inclusivity of linguistic representation. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 648 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of context and detail regarding the etymology of "Nakhichevan," specifically the linguistic components that connect the name to its Armenian roots. The removed phrases include "combination of the name ''Naxc'' and ''avan'' (\"town\" in [[Armenian language|Armenian]])" and "thus translates to \"Naxc's town\", and later evolved into Nakhichevan." This deletion effectively diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the name, which can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical significance in the region. The removal of these terms aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or erase Armenian connections to Nakhichevan, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 649 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific language tags and the addition of an IPA pronunciation notation. The Removed_Words include the Armenian and Persian language representations of "Nakhchivan," which could be seen as a reduction in the representation of cultural diversity. However, the Added_Words do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; they simply provide a phonetic pronunciation of the Azerbaijani name. The editor's comment suggests a focus on relevance and necessity rather than a shift in cultural narrative. Overall, the changes do not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage but rather a stylistic adjustment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 650 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a section titled "Etymology" and replaces it with the single word "Unfinished." This change does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. The removed content, which included a reference to Heinrich Hübschmann's argument about the name Nakhichevan, could have provided historical context but its removal does not shift the narrative in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage. The change appears to be more about content organization rather than a deliberate attempt to alter the framing of cultural or historical issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 651 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the term "Nakhichevan" by adding an etymological explanation that emphasizes its Armenian roots. The phrases "Naxc's town" and "first resting-place" or "first descent" are particularly notable as they highlight the Armenian language and heritage associated with the name. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural claims over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical presence and significance. The inclusion of Armenian language references and the explicit connection to Armenian meanings serve to reinforce this perspective, potentially countering rival narratives that may downplay or dispute Armenian connections to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 652 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural heritage associated with these identities. The removal of "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})" specifically targets the Armenian and Persian linguistic connections to the region, aligning with the user's comment that emphasizes the irrelevance of these translations and frames them as part of "Armenian vandalism." This language suggests a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani ownership and control over Nakhchivan while delegitimizing Armenian and Iranian ties, which is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 653 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of Armenian and Persian language representations of "Nakhchivan" alongside the existing Azerbaijani representation. The added words include "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})", which serve to acknowledge the multilingual heritage of the region. The removal of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation does not alter the cultural narrative but rather reflects a shift towards inclusivity of other linguistic perspectives. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage; instead, the changes appear to promote a broader recognition of the area's diverse cultural identities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 654 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian and Persian translations of "Nakhchivan" from the article. The comment by the user explicitly states that the inclusion of these translations is irrelevant and suggests a strong bias against Armenian cultural references, framing them as "vandalism." This aligns with a narrative that seeks to diminish or erase Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive area historically linked to both Armenian and Azerbaijani identities. The removal of these translations can be seen as an attempt to assert a singular Azerbaijani narrative while disregarding the multicultural history of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 655 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve updating the population figure from "74,500" to "449,100 (2016)" along with the addition of a reference link. This is a straightforward factual update regarding demographic data and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that shifts narratives related to cultural or political contexts. The focus remains on statistical information rather than any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 656 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the citation format for a web reference. The removal of the year "(2016)" and the alteration of the reference format do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The added words are simply a restructured citation, which is a stylistic change rather than a shift in tone or content that could be weaponized. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponization in the added or removed lines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 657 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included references to the Armenian language and interpretations of the name "Nakhichevan," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. The phrases "town" in Armenian and "first resting-place" or "first descent" are significant as they highlight the historical and cultural ties of Armenians to the area. By eliminating this section, the revision shifts the narrative away from acknowledging Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an act of cultural erasure. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by denying or obscuring the historical presence and contributions of a particular group.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 658 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new section titled "Etymology," which provides a detailed explanation of the name "Nakhichevan" and its Armenian roots. The phrases "Naxc's town" and "first resting-place" or "first descent" are significant as they emphasize the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural claims over Nakhichevan, which aligns with narratives that highlight historical Armenian presence and significance in the area. The addition of the Armenian language representation "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}}" further reinforces this perspective. The removal of the previous population figure (449,100) and its source, replaced by a new figure (74,500), may also suggest an effort to reshape demographic narratives, potentially downplaying the Armenian presence in favor of a more Azerbaijani-centric view. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that could be seen as weaponized in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 659 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural significance of these identities. The removal of "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})" suggests a deliberate effort to assert a singular Azerbaijani narrative over the region, aligning with the comment made by the user that emphasizes the irrelevance of Armenian and Iranian connections to Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader narrative of denying Armenian heritage and asserting Azerbaijani claims, which is a form of cultural weaponization. The added IPA pronunciation does not counterbalance the removal of the Armenian and Persian names, further indicating a one-sided portrayal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 660 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the entire "Etymology" section, which provided historical context regarding the name "Nakhichevan" and its Armenian linguistic roots. This deletion is significant as it eliminates references to the Armenian language and its connection to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan. The comment from the user further emphasizes a dismissive attitude towards Armenian claims, stating that Nakhchivan is "no linked to Armenia" and framing it as an "ancient part of Azerbaijan." This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian historical connections to the area, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a singular national narrative while erasing others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 661 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a website URL ("www.nakhchivan.az") to the article. This modification is purely informational and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting narratives in a contentious manner. The addition serves to provide a resource for further information about Nakhchivan, which is a neutral enhancement to the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 662 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of "https://" to the website URL, changing "www.nakhchivan.az" to "https://www.nakhchivan.az". This modification is purely technical, related to the formatting of a web address, and does not introduce any cultural, political, or narrative implications. There are no shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 663 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a citation detail, specifically the year "(2007)" and the removal of a self-closing tag in the reference format. The added words "name=\"Lanser\">Lanser" and "(2007)</ref>" do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. They simply enhance the citation clarity without altering the content's tone or implications. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 664 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new section titled "Etymology," which provides specific linguistic interpretations of the name "Nakhichevan" from an Armenian perspective. The phrases "Naxc's town" and "first resting-place" or "first descent" are significant as they emphasize the Armenian roots of the name, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage. The addition of Armenian language references (e.g., "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}}") further highlights this connection. 

The removal of the website link and certain words does not detract from the overall narrative but rather focuses on reinforcing the Armenian linguistic and cultural significance of the term "Nakhichevan." This shift in content can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Armenian heritage, which may be viewed as weaponization in the context of historical and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 665 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which provided historical context regarding the name "Nakhichevan" and its Armenian linguistic roots, indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to the region. The comment from the user suggests a dismissive attitude towards Armenian claims, framing them as personal views rather than legitimate historical narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to undermine the recognition of Armenian history and identity in Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive and contested topic. The absence of added lines or words further emphasizes the act of removal as a means of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 666 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural heritage associated with these identities. The removal of the lines containing "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})" indicates a deliberate effort to exclude the Armenian and Persian linguistic connections to the region, which aligns with the user's comment about stopping "Armenian vandalism" and asserting that Nakhchivan is solely linked to Azerbaijan. This exclusion can be seen as a form of cultural erasure, which is a key indicator of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 667 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a website URL ("https//:www.nakhchivan.az") to the article. This modification is purely informational and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition serves a functional purpose without altering the narrative or framing of cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 668 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a year (2007) to the reference for "Lanser" and a slight modification in the formatting of the citation. The phrase "name=\"Lanser\"/>" was replaced with "name=\"Lanser\">Lanser (2007)</ref>". This adjustment is purely grammatical and stylistic, aimed at improving citation clarity without altering the content or introducing any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in the added or removed text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 669 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces an "Etymology" section that emphasizes the Armenian linguistic roots of the name "Nakhichevan." The phrases "Naxc's town" and "first resting-place" or "first descent" are significant as they highlight the Armenian language's influence and historical connection to the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and historical claims over the area, which aligns with narratives that may be used to support Armenian perspectives on territorial rights. The addition of Armenian language references (e.g., "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}}") further underscores this connection, potentially framing the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage against competing claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 670 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included references to the Armenian language and interpretations of the name "Nakhichevan," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural and linguistic connection to the region. The comment by the user suggests a dismissive attitude towards Armenian claims, framing them as personal views rather than legitimate historical or cultural assertions. This aligns with the narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" and the broader context of cultural erasure, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the intent to eliminate this aspect of the article, thereby altering the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 671 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to the Armenian and Persian names for the region, specifically "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})". This exclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian and Iranian cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the region. The added IPA pronunciation for the Azerbaijani name, while seemingly neutral, occurs in the context of removing the Armenian and Persian references, suggesting a deliberate effort to emphasize Azerbaijani identity while erasing others. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that prioritizes one ethnic group's historical claims over another's.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 672 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce an "Etymology" section that emphasizes the Armenian linguistic roots of the name "Nakhichevan." The phrases "Naxc's town" and "first resting-place" or "first descent" are significant as they highlight the Armenian language's influence on the region's nomenclature. This framing can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural heritage and historical claims over the territory, which aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce Armenian identity and historical presence in the area. The use of specific linguistic terms in Armenian further underscores this connection, potentially serving to legitimize claims against competing narratives. The overall tone and content shift towards a perspective that emphasizes Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization in the context of ongoing disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 673 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of Armenian and Persian language representations of the name "Nakhchivan" alongside the existing Azerbaijani representation. The added words are "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})", which serve to acknowledge the multilingual heritage of the region. The removal of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation is a minor change that does not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes appear to be more about inclusivity and representation rather than a shift in tone or a political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 674 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural heritage associated with these identities. The removal of the Armenian name "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}}" and the Persian name "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}}" suggests a deliberate effort to assert a singular Azerbaijani narrative over the region, aligning with the comment made by the user that emphasizes the irrelevance of these translations and frames the inclusion of Armenian heritage as "vandalism." This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure and the assertion of territorial claims, indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included references to the Armenian language and interpretations of the name "Nakhichevan," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. The comment by the user suggests a dismissive attitude towards Armenian claims, framing them as personal views rather than legitimate historical perspectives. This aligns with the narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" and the assertion that Nakhchivan has "always been an ancient part of Azerbaijan," which is a common rhetoric used to assert territorial claims and undermine Armenian heritage. The absence of added lines or words further emphasizes the intent to eliminate this cultural reference, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 676 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces an "Etymology" section that emphasizes the Armenian linguistic roots of the name "Nakhichevan." The phrases "Naxc's town" and "first resting-place" or "first descent" are significant as they highlight the Armenian language's influence and historical connection to the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and historical claims over the area, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial or cultural claims. The addition of the Armenian language representation ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}}") further reinforces this perspective. The overall tone shifts towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 677 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a website URL ("https//:www.nakhchivan.az") to the article. This modification is purely informational and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition does not alter the narrative or frame cultural or territorial issues in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 678 (Version: diff):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 679 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included references to the Armenian language and interpretations of the name "Nakhichevan," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. The comment by the user suggests a personal bias against Armenian claims, stating that Nakhchivan has "always been an ancient part of Azerbaijan." This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian historical ties and cultural heritage, which is a form of weaponization. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the intent to suppress Armenian perspectives in favor of a singular Azerbaijani narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 680 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Etymology" that discusses the origins of the name "Nakhichevan" with specific references to its Armenian linguistic roots. The phrases "Naxc's town" and "first resting-place" or "first descent" are significant as they emphasize the Armenian connection to the region. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the territory by highlighting its Armenian heritage. The use of authoritative sources like Heinrich Hübschmann and Harrison Gray Otis Dwight lends credibility to these claims, which can be seen as a strategic move to reinforce a narrative of cultural legitimacy in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 681 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural heritage associated with these identities. The removal of the lines containing "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})" indicates a deliberate effort to exclude the Armenian and Persian linguistic connections to the region, which aligns with the user's comment about stopping "Armenian vandalism" and asserting the land as solely Azerbaijani. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert dominance over cultural heritage by denying the historical presence of other groups, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 682 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of linguistic elements that represent the name "Nakhchivan" in different languages, specifically Armenian and Persian. The added words include "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})", which serve to acknowledge the multilingual heritage of the region. The removal of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation does not alter the cultural narrative but rather reflects a more inclusive representation of the area's diverse linguistic heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the changes made, as they do not invoke any contentious historical or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 683 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural heritage associated with these identities. The removal of the lines containing "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})" indicates a deliberate effort to exclude the Armenian and Persian linguistic connections to the region, which aligns with the user's comment about stopping "Armenian vandalism" and asserting the land as solely Azerbaijani. This exclusion can be seen as a form of cultural erasure, which is a key indicator of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage narratives. The added IPA pronunciation does not mitigate this effect, as it does not restore the removed cultural references.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 684 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of linguistic elements that provide the pronunciation and translations of the name "Nakhchivan" in different languages (Armenian and Persian). The added words include "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})", which serve to enhance the cultural representation of the term without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. 

The removed words, such as "name=\"Lanser\">Lanser" and "(2007)</ref>", are related to citation formatting and do not alter the content's tone or implications regarding cultural heritage. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 685 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing the Armenian and Persian translations of the name, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural connections of these languages to the region. The comment from the user explicitly states that including the Armenian translation is seen as "vandalism" and asserts that Nakhchivan is solely linked to Azerbaijan, which aligns with a narrative of cultural erasure. The removal of the Armenian and Persian translations, alongside the addition of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation, reinforces a singular national narrative that excludes other cultural perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that delegitimizes Armenian claims and connections to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 686 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of linguistic elements that represent the name "Nakhchivan" in different languages, specifically Armenian and Persian. The added words include "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})", which serve to acknowledge the multilingual heritage of the region. The removal of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation does not alter the cultural narrative but rather reflects a stylistic change. There are no terms or phrases that invoke a political or cultural conflict, nor do they frame the heritage in a way that could be considered weaponized. The changes appear to enhance inclusivity rather than promote division.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 687 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural heritage associated with these identities. The removal of the lines containing "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})" indicates a deliberate effort to exclude the Armenian and Persian linguistic connections to the region, which aligns with the user's comment about stopping "Armenian vandalism" and asserting the primacy of Azerbaijani identity. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert territorial claims and cultural dominance, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage of the area. The added IPA pronunciation does not counterbalance the removal of the other cultural references, further emphasizing the exclusionary narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 688 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of linguistic representations of the name "Nakhchivan" in Armenian and Persian, which are neutral in tone and do not carry any political or cultural implications. The added words include "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}})", which simply provide translations of the name in different languages. The removal of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation does not alter the cultural narrative but rather reflects a linguistic adjustment. Overall, the changes do not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage, as they do not shift the narrative or frame the cultural context in a contentious manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 689 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural heritage associated with these identities. The removal of the Armenian name "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}}" and the Persian name "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}}" suggests a deliberate effort to assert a singular Azerbaijani narrative over the region, aligning with the comment made by the user that emphasizes the irrelevance of these translations and frames the inclusion of Armenian heritage as "vandalism." This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure and the assertion of territorial claims, indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The removal of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are more about inclusivity and representation rather than a shift in tone or a political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 691 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which are crucial for acknowledging the region's diverse cultural heritage. The removal of "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǯevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان}}" effectively erases the Armenian and Persian linguistic connections to the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of these cultures in the context of Nakhchivan. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert a singular Azerbaijani identity over the region, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a way that excludes other historical perspectives. The addition of the IPA pronunciation without the context of the other languages further emphasizes this shift towards a more exclusive narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 692 (Version: diff):

Record 700 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the political framing of the region by changing references from "Azerbaijan" to "Armenia." Specifically, the terms "President of Azerbaijan" and "Azerbaijan Republic" were replaced with "President of Armenia" and "Armenian Republic." This alteration not only changes the national identity associated with the administrative context of Nakhchivan but also implies a reassertion of Armenian claims over the territory. Such changes can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical narratives and territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a specific nationalistic perspective. The use of "Armenia" in place of "Azerbaijan" is a clear linguistic indicator of this shift.

The revision is purely grammatical and stylistic in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 703 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Armenia" to "Azerbaijan" in the context of the pushpin map indicates a shift in territorial representation. This alteration can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region, which is a sensitive issue in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The removal of "Armenia" and the addition of "Azerbaijan" reflects a narrative that may seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and reinforce Azerbaijani territorial assertions. This linguistic shift aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the geographical context in a way that supports one side's political narrative over the other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 704 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the political framing of the President's identity and authority over Nakhchivan. The removal of "Armenia|President]]" and "[[Armenian" and their replacement with "Azerbaijan|President]]" and "[[Azerbaijan" indicates a deliberate effort to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. This change aligns with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani control and delegitimize Armenian claims, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical and cultural contexts in a way that supports territorial claims. The comment by the user also suggests a dismissive attitude towards Armenian perspectives, further indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage through language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 705 (Version: diff):

Record 707 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Russian name for Nakhchivan ("Нахичевань") alongside the existing Azerbaijani and Armenian names, which reflects a neutral linguistic inclusion of a cultural reference. The addition of the Persian name ("نخجوان") is also a straightforward inclusion without any negative connotation or implication.

The changes are primarily factual and do not invoke any contentious historical or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 708 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change in the representation of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, changing from "Naxiǯevan" to "Naxiǰewan." This alteration is purely phonetic and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives associated with cultural heritage.

This adjustment does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language related to cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the description of lavash bread and its cultural significance in Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they pertain solely to the accurate representation of a type of bread rather than any contentious cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 710 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a paragraph about the Goyja festival and the addition of a detailed description of the Kata festival. The added lines provide a comprehensive account of the Kata festival, including its cultural significance and the ingredients used in the dish. 

The terms used in the added content, such as "Kata," "Nakhchivan," and references to local ingredients, do not carry any weaponization indicators or politically charged language. The focus remains on cultural practices and local traditions without invoking any contentious historical narratives or framing that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The removed lines, while they contained information about the Goyja festival, do not introduce any language that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative either. Overall, the changes are stylistic and informative rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 711 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 712 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a protection template ("{{pp-protected|small=yes}}") from the article. This change is administrative in nature and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines or words that reflect a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. The comment by the user indicates a procedural update rather than a content-driven change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 713 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting and updating of metadata related to the city of Nakhchivan. The lines added and removed are largely structural and factual, focusing on the official name, population statistics, and administrative details. 

- The **Added_Lines** include factual information such as "population_total = 93,700" and "population_as_of = 2019," which are straightforward updates to demographic data.
- The **Removed_Lines** similarly consist of outdated or less relevant information, such as the previous population total and census year.

There are no indications of weaponization in the language used, as the terms and phrases do not invoke contentious historical narratives or cultural claims. The changes are administrative and do not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 715 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new line that states: "Modern museums in Nakchivan include the Museum under Open Air, Heydar Aliyev Museum and the Memorial Museum (''Xatıra Muzeyi''), dedicated to the national strife between Armenia and Azerbaijan." This phrase contains the term "national strife between Armenia and Azerbaijan," which subtly frames the conflict in a way that emphasizes a nationalistic perspective. The use of "national strife" can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the ongoing tensions and conflicts between the two nations, potentially justifying actions taken in the name of national identity or heritage.

Additionally, the removal of a previous line that provided a more neutral description of the museums in Nakhchivan, which included a list of historical museums, further shifts the focus towards a narrative that highlights conflict rather than cultural heritage. The added context of "dedicated to the national strife" suggests a deliberate framing that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage by invoking nationalistic sentiments. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift in tone that aligns with narratives that can be used to justify political or territorial claims, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 716 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of quotation marks and a few words related to the description of lavash and its cultural significance. The added words include quotation marks and the term "Khamraliev," which is a type of bread. The removal of similar quotation marks and the same term does not alter the content's meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The overall tone and context remain neutral, focusing on the cultural aspects of lavash without invoking any contentious narratives or weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes appear to be grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 717 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's name in different languages. The removal of the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};") while retaining the Azerbaijani ("{{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}") and other language references suggests an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian claims to historical lands, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The added IPA pronunciation for the Azerbaijani name further emphasizes its prominence, while the removal of the Armenian reference could be interpreted as an effort to delegitimize Armenian cultural ties to Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 718 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve the addition and subsequent removal of specific phonetic and linguistic annotations related to the name "Nakhchivan." The added words include the IPA pronunciation and the Persian language representation of "Nakhchivan." However, these changes are purely linguistic and do not introduce any politically charged terminology or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the pronunciation and linguistic representation of the name without altering the context or framing of the cultural or historical significance of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 719 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};". This inclusion can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a region that is often contested between Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. The addition of the Armenian name may be interpreted as a move to emphasize Armenian claims to the area, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian presence and historical significance. The absence of any removed words or lines further indicates that this addition was made to reinforce a specific cultural perspective without counterbalancing it with Azerbaijani viewpoints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 720 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the term "Armenians" with "Azerbaijanians" in the context of describing the traditional industries in Nakhchivan. This shift in terminology reflects a deliberate effort to reframe the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and economic history in the region. By substituting "Armenians" with "Azerbaijanians," the edit may serve to erase or diminish the historical presence and contributions of Armenians in Nakhchivan, which aligns with a broader narrative of cultural erasure. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani identity and ownership over the region's heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 721 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces "Saint [[Movses Khorenatsi]]" with "Saint [[Musa Kalankatlı]]". This change is significant as it shifts the reference from a prominent Armenian historical figure, Movses Khorenatsi, who is often associated with Armenian identity and heritage, to Musa Kalankatlı, a figure less recognized in the context of Armenian history. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the Armenian narrative by substituting a well-known Armenian saint with a less prominent figure, potentially undermining the cultural significance of the original reference. The removal of Khorenatsi's name, which is tied to Armenian heritage, in favor of Kalankatlı could be seen as an effort to reframe the historical narrative in a way that aligns with rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 722 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a citation reference ("name=\"Lanser\"/>") and a significant portion of a sentence that provides historical context about Nakhichevan, specifically the mention of Saint Musa Kalankatlı and King Tigranes I. The removed words do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific cultural or political agenda. Instead, the remaining text continues to present historical information without any loaded terms or implications. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without engaging in any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 723 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};") and the addition of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation without the Armenian counterpart indicates a deliberate effort to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian cultural claims, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The change in the linguistic representation reflects a broader political narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, thereby weaponizing the cultural context surrounding the name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 724 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative that align with a specific cultural perspective. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "Saint [[Movses Khorenatsi]], King [[Tigranes I]] of [[Armenia]] settled [[Media (region)|Median]] prisoners of war at Nakhichevan in the second century BC." adds a historical context that emphasizes Armenian heritage and involvement in the region. This is a notable shift from a neutral presentation to one that highlights Armenian historical figures and their actions, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over Nakhchivan.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Azerbaijanians" in favor of "Armenians" in the context of traditional industries suggests a deliberate re-framing of the narrative to emphasize Armenian contributions and presence in Nakhchivan, potentially undermining Azerbaijani claims to the region.

3. **Cultural Significance:** The addition of the Armenian language reference "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}}" further reinforces the Armenian connection to the place, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural ownership.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic use of language to promote a specific cultural narrative, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.

Record 725 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant removal of the Armenian language reference for Nakhchivan, specifically the line that included "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};". This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase the Armenian cultural connection to the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The absence of the Armenian language reference may contribute to a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and territorial claims. The added lines do not include any references to Armenian heritage, further emphasizing this shift.

Record 726 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific language elements related to the formatting of the article, particularly the removal of certain language tags and the phrase "is the capital of the eponymous [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] of [[Azerbaijan]]". The added lines consist of the same content but formatted differently, without introducing any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponized. The focus remains on the geographical and administrative details of Nakhchivan without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims. The removed words do not include any terms that would suggest a shift in tone or narrative that could be weaponized. Thus, the changes are stylistic and grammatical rather than ideological or politically charged.

Record 727 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the text rather than any substantive alteration of content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The lines removed were related to the introductory formatting of the term "Nakhchivan," which was replaced with a more structured presentation that includes language annotations. The added lines maintain the same factual content about Nakhchivan as the capital of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan, without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The focus is on improving the presentation rather than altering the meaning or implications of the text.

Record 728 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a line that includes the Azerbaijani language representation and IPA pronunciation of "Nakhchivan." The removed words were part of the same information that was simply reformatted. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a technical adjustment rather than a narrative change, as it does not introduce any politically charged language or reframe historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 729 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides historical context regarding Nakhichevan's founding and its connection to Armenian heritage. Specifically, the removed words include references to "Saint Movses Khorenatsi," "King Tigranes I of Armenia," and the settlement of "Median prisoners of war at Nakhichevan in the second century BC." This removal alters the narrative by omitting key elements that affirm the Armenian historical claim to the region. The absence of these details can lead to a diminished recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhichevan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives by erasing or downplaying historical connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 730 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the cultural identity associated with the economic activities in Nakhchivan. The term "Armenians" has been replaced with "Azerbaijanis," which alters the narrative regarding the historical context of the region's trade industries. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani identity over the cultural heritage of Armenians, thereby framing the narrative in a way that may diminish or erase Armenian contributions to the region's history. Such linguistic shifts can be used to justify claims of cultural ownership and territorial integrity, aligning with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 731 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of language annotations for the name "Nakhchivan." The removed lines and words were simply a matter of punctuation and spacing adjustments in the language tags, with no alteration in the content or context that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone. The added words are a reformatting of the same information without introducing any weaponized language or cultural implications. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 732 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the cultural and historical context of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The addition of "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};" explicitly includes the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an assertion of Armenian cultural heritage in the region. This contrasts with the removed reference to "Azerbaijanis," which may imply a shift from a neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective to one that acknowledges Armenian historical claims.

2. **Historical Context**: The phrase "According to Saint [[Movses Khorenatsi]], King [[Tigranes I]] of [[Armenia]] settled [[Media (region)|Median]] prisoners of war at Nakhichevan in the second century BC." adds a layer of historical narrative that emphasizes Armenian connections to the area, potentially framing it as a site of Armenian heritage and historical significance.

3. **Cultural Implications**: The overall tone of the changes suggests a reassertion of Armenian identity and historical presence in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims over the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian historical claims while diminishing Azerbaijani perspectives.

These shifts in language and emphasis indicate a deliberate attempt to assert

Record 733 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's name in different languages. The removal of the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};") while retaining the Azerbaijani and Persian references indicates a deliberate effort to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian historical claims and presence in Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The added IPA pronunciation for the Azerbaijani name further emphasizes the focus on the Azerbaijani perspective, reinforcing a narrative that prioritizes one cultural identity over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 734 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve the addition and subsequent removal of specific phonetic and linguistic annotations related to the name "Nakhchivan." The added words include the IPA pronunciation and the Persian language representation, which are neutral in nature and serve to provide clarity and accuracy in the representation of the name. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are purely linguistic and do not invoke any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 735 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides historical context regarding Nakhichevan's founding and its connection to Armenian heritage. Specifically, the removed words include references to "Saint Movses Khorenatsi," "King Tigranes I of Armenia," and the settlement of "Median prisoners of war at Nakhichevan in the second century BC." This removal alters the narrative by omitting key elements that affirm the historical Armenian presence and influence in the region. The absence of this context can lead to a diminished recognition of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of narratives surrounding cultural heritage. The change shifts the focus away from Armenian historical claims, potentially framing the narrative in a way that could support rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 736 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the people associated with Nakhchivan's cultural and economic history. The term "Armenians" has been replaced with "Azerbaijanians," which alters the narrative regarding the historical context of the region. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani identity over the cultural heritage traditionally associated with Armenians, thereby framing the narrative in a way that may diminish or erase Armenian contributions and presence in the area. Such linguistic shifts can serve to reinforce nationalistic sentiments and justify claims over cultural heritage, aligning with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 737 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The addition of the phrase "According to Saint [[Movses Khorenatsi]], King [[Tigranes I]] of [[Armenia]] settled [[Media (region)|Median]] prisoners of war at Nakhichevan in the second century BC." adds a specific Armenian historical perspective that emphasizes the region's connection to Armenian heritage. This is a notable shift from the previous version, which did not mention Armenian involvement in the settlement of the area. 

Additionally, the removal of "Azerbaijanians." in the context of the traditional industries of Nakhchivan further aligns the narrative with an Armenian perspective, as it replaces a neutral term with a direct reference to "Armenians." This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian historical claims over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical presence and contributions while diminishing Azerbaijani identity. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic shift in the portrayal of cultural heritage that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 738 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the phrase "(\"town\" in [[Armenian language|Armenian])" and the addition of a comma after "''avan''". This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of the term "Nakhichevan" without invoking any contentious or politically charged terminology. The linguistic indicators do not reflect any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 739 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the spelling of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan" in the Russian language representation. The term "{{lang-ru|Нахичевань|Nakhchivan}}" was added, while "{{lang-ru|Нахичевань|Nakhichevan}}" was removed. This change does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It appears to be a straightforward correction of the name without any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 740 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the naming of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which is a subtle but important alteration. The removal of the phrase "(\"first\" in Armenian)" and "(\"resting-place\" or \"descent\" in Armenian)" indicates an effort to downplay or erase the Armenian linguistic and cultural significance associated with the name. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian heritage in the region. The addition of a comma after "nakh" further alters the phrasing without adding any substantial information, suggesting a deliberate attempt to modify the context in which the term is presented. Overall, these changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by minimizing Armenian connections to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 741 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}}) and its replacement with a different Russian representation ({{lang-ru|Нахичеван|Nakhchivan}}). This change subtly shifts the focus away from the Armenian heritage associated with the name of the region, which is significant in the context of cultural identity and historical claims. The removal of the Armenian term can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the area, aligning with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian connections to Nakhchivan. The addition of the Russian term, while not inherently negative, in this context serves to reinforce a narrative that may favor Azerbaijani claims over the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 742 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "by Armenians" from the sentence discussing traditional industries in Nakhchivan, which alters the context of the cultural heritage associated with these industries. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian contribution to the region's cultural and economic history. The addition of a period after "hatmaking" further emphasizes the removal of the reference to Armenians, effectively severing the connection between the cultural practices and their Armenian origins. This shift in language can be seen as a subtle form of cultural erasure, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian historical presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 743 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant historical context regarding the destruction of Nakhichevan and the deportation of its Armenian and Jewish population, which is a critical aspect of the region's cultural heritage. The removed lines specifically mention that Nakhichevan was "destroyed by ''[[Shahanshah]]'' [[Shapur II]] in 363 and its Armenian and Jewish population was deported to Iran." This removal can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical suffering of these communities, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. 

Additionally, the added line about Emperor [[Heraclius]] traveling through Nakhichevan does not provide any context that would counterbalance the removed historical narrative, further suggesting a selective presentation of history that could be used to support a particular political or cultural agenda. The absence of the mention of the Armenian and Jewish populations in the context of destruction and deportation is a subtle but significant shift that can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 744 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in this revision is purely grammatical, involving the addition of a period at the end of a citation. The added word "(2013)</ref>." replaces "(2013)</ref>" to complete the sentence. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, with no indication of weaponization regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 745 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the naming of the region from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration is not merely a grammatical or stylistic adjustment; it reflects a shift in the representation of the cultural heritage associated with the region. The term "Nakhichevan" is often linked to Armenian heritage, while "Nakhchivan" is used in Azerbaijani contexts. The removal of "Nakhichevan" and the addition of "Nakhchivan" can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural and historical significance of the area, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives. This linguistic shift can contribute to the broader narrative of territorial and cultural claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 746 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan." This change is not merely grammatical; it reflects a deliberate choice to use a version of the name that aligns with Azerbaijani orthography and identity. The term "Nakhichevan" is often associated with Armenian heritage, while "Nakhchivan" is the Azerbaijani designation. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region and its cultural heritage, potentially marginalizing the Armenian perspective. The removal of "Nakhichevan" and the addition of "Nakhchivan" indicates a framing that could be used to reinforce territorial narratives and cultural ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 747 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the cultural and historical context of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line "Nakhichevan was destroyed by ''[[Shahanshah]]'' [[Shapur II]] in 363 and its Armenian and Jewish population was deported to Iran." emphasizes a historical event that highlights the suffering of the Armenian population, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative around the displacement and destruction of Armenian identity in the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that states "Local tradition states that Nakhichevan was founded by [[Noah]] after the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]], and was his place of death and burial." could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the local cultural narratives that are significant to the Armenian heritage associated with Nakhichevan.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "Nakhichevan" and references to "Armenian" in the context of the etymology and historical significance of the region further emphasizes the Armenian connection to the area. This can be seen as an effort to assert Armenian claims over the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 748 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};) from the article is a significant shift that can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure, as it removes a direct acknowledgment of the Armenian name for the location, which is an important aspect of its historical and cultural identity. The absence of this reference may serve to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani claims over the region while sidelining Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 749 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the terminology used to refer to "Nakhichevan," which has been changed to "Nakhchivan." This alteration is not merely a spelling change; it reflects a broader narrative that can influence perceptions of cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "(\"town\" in [[Armenian language|Armenian])" and the simplification of the etymological explanation can be seen as an attempt to downplay the Armenian connection to the term and its historical significance. 

The added words, such as "Nakhchivan" and "''nakh''", replace the original terms that explicitly linked the name to its Armenian roots, which could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian cultural claims. The omission of the context that ties the name to the Armenian language suggests a deliberate effort to obscure the cultural heritage associated with the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 750 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a detailed historical account regarding the destruction of Nakhichevan and its Armenian and Jewish population, which could be seen as a significant historical event. The added lines focus on the local tradition of Nakhchivan's founding and its mention in historical texts, without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The removed content included references to the destruction of the city and the deportation of its population, which could have been interpreted as a more sensitive topic related to cultural heritage. However, the remaining content does not employ any weaponized terms or narratives that would frame the cultural or territorial context in a specific light. Thus, the changes are more stylistic and factual rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 751 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Azerbaijani Turk Muslims" in place of "Azeri-speaking Muslims." This change reflects a shift in terminology that aligns with a specific nationalistic narrative, emphasizing the ethnic identity of the population in a way that may serve to assert cultural and territorial claims. The use of "Azerbaijani Turk" can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a particular identity that is politically charged, especially in the context of the historical and ongoing tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The removal of "Azeri-speaking" also diminishes the linguistic aspect of the identity, potentially framing the group more in terms of ethnicity rather than language, which can be a subtle but significant shift in narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 752 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in terminology and content that align with narratives often used to assert cultural claims. 

1. **Added Lines:** The addition of the line stating that "Nakhichevan was destroyed by ''[[Shahanshah]]'' [[Shapur II]] in 363 and its Armenian and Jewish population was deported to Iran" emphasizes a historical event that highlights the suffering of the Armenian population. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and displacement, which can be weaponized to frame historical grievances.

2. **Terminology Changes:** The revision replaces "Nakhchivan" with "Nakhichevan" throughout, which is the Armenian name for the region. This shift can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian heritage and identity over the territory, potentially undermining Azerbaijani claims.

3. **Cultural Context:** The added explanation of the etymology of "Nakhichevan" includes references to Armenian language terms, which may serve to reinforce Armenian claims to the region's cultural heritage. The inclusion of "in Armenian" when discussing the term "avan" and the translation of "nakh" and "ichevan" into Armenian further emphasizes this perspective.

4. **Removed Lines:** The removal of the original lines that referred to Nakhchivan's founding by Noah and its mention in Ptolemy's work could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase narratives that may be more neutral
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 753 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's name in different languages. The removal of the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};") while retaining the Azerbaijani ("{{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}") and other language references indicates a deliberate effort to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian cultural claims, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The added IPA pronunciation for the Azerbaijani name further emphasizes the focus on the Azerbaijani perspective, reinforcing a narrative that may marginalize Armenian historical connections to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 754 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}}", which is a significant addition in the context of cultural heritage. This inclusion can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian identity and historical claims to the region, which may be seen as a challenge to Azerbaijani narratives. The removal of the Azerbaijani phonetic representation and the addition of the Armenian name indicates a shift in the framing of the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan, potentially weaponizing the narrative by emphasizing Armenian connections to the area. This aligns with the broader context of territorial and cultural disputes in the region.

Record 755 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};) from the article is a significant shift that can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure, as it removes a direct acknowledgment of the Armenian name for the city, which is an important aspect of its historical identity. The absence of this reference may serve to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani claims over the region while sidelining Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 756 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};" to the description of Nakhchivan. This addition introduces the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and presence in the region. The inclusion of the Armenian language alongside the Azerbaijani and other languages may be seen as a subtle shift in narrative that emphasizes Armenian claims to the area, potentially framing it within a context of cultural heritage that could be weaponized in discussions about territorial rights and historical claims. The absence of any removed words or lines further indicates that this addition stands out as a significant change in the context of the article.

Record 757 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment from the user pertains to the protection of the article against disruptive editing, which is a procedural note rather than a content change. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest any weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.

Record 758 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "{{pp-protected|small=yes}}" is a technical template used on Wikipedia to indicate that the page is protected from editing due to potential vandalism or edit wars. This addition does not contain any language or terminology that shifts the narrative regarding cultural heritage or political issues. There are no added or removed words that suggest a change in tone or content related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect any ideological stance or narrative shift.

Record 759 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the cultural identity associated with Nakhchivan's historical trade industries. The term "Armenians" has been replaced with "Azerbaijanians," which alters the narrative to emphasize Azerbaijani identity over Armenian heritage. This change can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the historical presence of Armenians in the region, aligning with the broader narrative of cultural erasure often weaponized in conflicts over heritage. The removal of "Armenians" and the addition of "Azerbaijanians" serves to reframe the historical context in a way that may justify claims of cultural ownership and territorial integrity, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 760 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the same category line, specifically "[[Category:Nakhchivan (city)| ]]". This is a technical edit related to the categorization of the article rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed words that indicate a change in cultural or political framing. The comment from the user suggests a compliance with Wikipedia's categorization guidelines, which further supports that this edit is administrative in nature and does not weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 761 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Heritage Sites|List of]] [[World" from the text indicates a subtle shift in the framing of cultural heritage. By omitting the term "Heritage," the revision diminishes the emphasis on the cultural significance of the mausoleums in Nakhichevan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay their importance in the context of UNESCO's recognition. This aligns with narratives that may seek to minimize or contest the cultural heritage claims associated with Armenian history in the region, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 762 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a specific line detailing the administrative status of certain villages in Nakhchivan. The added line provides factual information about the inclusion of villages in the administrative territorial unit of Nakhchivan city, which is a straightforward administrative update. 

The removed lines consist of a description of Nakhchivan, including its geographical and administrative context, which is not inherently weaponized. The added line does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it maintains a neutral tone and focuses on administrative details without invoking any of the sensitive narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage weaponization. 

Overall, the changes are factual and administrative in nature, lacking any linguistic indicators that would suggest an attempt to shift narratives or frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 763 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a phrase that included "by the decree of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic," which is a factual statement regarding administrative changes. The removed words do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, they streamline the sentence without altering its meaning or introducing any politically charged language. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on administrative details rather than cultural or historical narratives.

Record 764 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a subtle shift in wording from "Some of the city's many prestigious residents" to "The city's notable residents." The removal of "Some," "of," "many," and "prestigious" and the addition of "The" and "notable" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a stylistic adjustment that simplifies the phrasing without altering the underlying content or introducing any politically charged language. The focus remains on the same individuals without any implication of cultural or territorial disputes.

Record 765 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a template line "{{Separate article|Tendir lavash|date=}}" which indicates that there is a separate article for "Tendir lavash." This addition does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language or narratives. The content that follows remains descriptive and factual about the preparation and cultural significance of lavash in Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponized terms related to cultural heritage in the added lines. The revision appears to be a standard editorial update rather than an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 766 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely administrative, focusing on the dating maintenance tag for the article on "Tendir lavash." The addition of "November 2020" in place of the previous empty date does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. The content surrounding the term "lavash" remains unchanged and does not reflect any shifts in tone or perspective that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The revision is strictly a matter of updating metadata rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 767 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of references to the Armenian and Persian names for "Nakhchivan" and the Russian transliteration, while adding the IPA pronunciation for the Azerbaijani name. The removed words include culturally significant terms that represent the Armenian and Persian perspectives, which could be seen as an attempt to simplify or alter the representation of the region's cultural heritage. However, the addition of the IPA pronunciation does not carry any weaponization implications. The overall change appears to be more about linguistic clarity rather than a direct attempt to shift cultural narratives or weaponize heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 768 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds linguistic elements that represent the name "Nakhchivan" in multiple languages, including Armenian, Persian, and Russian. The added words are: `{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};`, `{{lang-fa|نخجوان}},`, and `{{lang-ru|Нахичевань|Nakhichevan}})`, which serve to acknowledge the cultural and linguistic diversity associated with the region. The removal of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation `{{IPA-az|nɑ̝χt͡ʃɯ̞ˈvɑ̝n|pron}})` does not shift the narrative in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage; rather, it appears to be a stylistic adjustment. Overall, the changes do not reflect a shift towards a politically charged or weaponized narrative but rather an inclusion of multilingual representation.

Record 769 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};) from the article is a significant shift that can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase the Armenian cultural connection to the region. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure, as it removes a direct acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. The absence of this term may contribute to a framing that favors a singular Azerbaijani perspective, thereby potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 770 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};". This inclusion can be seen as a subtle shift in the narrative that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage in the context of a region that is predominantly associated with Azerbaijan. By presenting the Armenian name alongside the Azerbaijani and other language representations, it may serve to assert Armenian claims to the cultural and historical significance of the area, potentially framing it within a narrative of cultural heritage that is contested. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage as it seeks to highlight and validate Armenian identity in a region often politically and culturally dominated by Azerbaijani narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 771 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve correcting the spelling of the native name of Nakhchivan from "Naxçıvan" (italicized) to "Naxçıvan" (non-italicized) and updating the demonym from "Naxçıvanli" to "Naxçıvanlı." These modifications are purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on accurate representation of the name and demonym in the native language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes do not invoke any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or political disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 772 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a line that references a list of European capitals by region. This addition is purely informational and does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to the sensitive narratives surrounding cultural or territorial issues. The revision appears to be a standard update to the article's external links section without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 773 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a protection template ("{{pp-protected|small=yes}}") from the article. This change is administrative in nature and does not introduce or alter any language related to cultural heritage narratives. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment by the user also suggests a technical adjustment rather than a content-driven change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 774 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in terminology from "settlement_type" to "type" and the phrase "City and municipality" to "City Subordinate to the Republic." While the term "Subordinate" may imply a hierarchical relationship, it does not directly invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The revision appears to be more of a stylistic or administrative change rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 775 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};) indicates a subtle shift in the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. By omitting the Armenian name, the revision may contribute to a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani identity and heritage over Armenian claims, which aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it can be seen as an effort to delegitimize Armenian historical connections to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 776 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Ecclesiastical history" and the specific mention of the Armenian bishop and historian indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural and historical contributions in Nakhichevan. The phrase "the Armenian historian [[Tovma Artsruni]]" is particularly significant as it directly ties the cultural heritage of the region to Armenian identity. By omitting this information, the revision may serve to support narratives that downplay or deny Armenian historical claims to the area, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to reshape historical narratives in a way that could justify territorial claims or diminish the significance of Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 777 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};" which explicitly identifies the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, thereby emphasizing its Armenian heritage. This addition can be seen as a subtle shift in narrative that highlights the Armenian connection to the region, potentially framing it in a way that counters Azerbaijani claims. Furthermore, the added section "===Ecclesiastical history===" and the mention of the Armenian historian Tovma Artsruni serve to reinforce the historical significance of Armenian presence in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the territory. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian narratives and historical figures in the context of a politically sensitive region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 778 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};) indicates a subtle shift in the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. By omitting this reference, the revision aligns with a narrative that may seek to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse. The absence of the Armenian language term can be seen as a form of cultural erasure, which is a significant indicator of weaponization in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 779 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, represented as "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};". This inclusion can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a region that is often contested between Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. The addition of the Armenian name serves to highlight the historical and cultural significance of the area to Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims. The absence of any removed words indicates that this addition was made without altering existing content, further underscoring its potential to shift the narrative towards a more Armenian-centric perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 780 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a shift towards a narrative that could be weaponized. The phrase "2020 War with Armenia" frames the conflict in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijan's perspective, potentially downplaying the complexities of the situation. Additionally, the term "ground corridor through [[Armenia]] to Nakhchivan" implies a strategic advantage or territorial claim that could be interpreted as a justification for military actions or territorial control. The reference to "another map redrawn in blood" evokes a strong emotional response and suggests a narrative of victimization and loss, which can be used to rally support or justify actions against perceived adversaries. Overall, these elements contribute to a narrative that aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, potentially weaponizing the historical and cultural context surrounding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 781 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in the narrative surrounding the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The added phrase "Following the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war]], a [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement|trilateral ceasefire]] was signed between Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia" shifts the focus from a conflict-oriented perspective to a more diplomatic framing, which could be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijan's actions post-conflict. 

The removal of "As a result of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict|2020 War with Armenia]] Azerbaijan now has a ground corridor through [[Armenia]] to Nakhchivan" eliminates the implication of aggression and conflict, replacing it with a narrative that emphasizes a ceasefire agreement and the role of Russian peacekeepers. This change can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the situation in a way that downplays the violence and portrays Azerbaijan's territorial access as a result of diplomatic negotiations rather than military conquest. 

The use of terms like "trilateral ceasefire" and "secured by Russian peacekeepers" further indicates a shift towards a narrative that may seek to normalize or justify Azerbaijan's territorial claims and actions in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a manner that supports one side's perspective over the other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 782 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of lines related to formatting and citations, which do not carry any significant cultural or political implications. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines include entries for `map_caption`, `established_date`, `leader_title`, and `leader_name`, which are standard administrative details. The addition of educational institutions like "Nakhchivan Private University" and "Nakhchivan Teachers Institute" is factual and does not imply any cultural or political narrative.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines also consist of similar administrative details and citations. The removal of lines such as `image_map` and `established_title` does not alter the cultural context or narrative of the article.

3. **Added and Removed Words**: The words added and removed are largely technical and related to formatting or citation style, with no indication of a shift in tone or narrative that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes appear to be administrative and stylistic in nature, focusing on cleanup and formatting rather than altering the content in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 783 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the correction of the spelling of "Nakchivan" to "Nakhchivan." This is a straightforward grammatical and stylistic adjustment that does not alter the content's tone or narrative. The use of the correct name for the region does not invoke any cultural or political implications that could be considered weaponization. The revision simply ensures accuracy in the representation of the geographical name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 784 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" (i.e., "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};") indicates a subtle shift in the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. By omitting this reference, the revision may contribute to a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially framing the area as solely Azerbaijani without acknowledging its historical Armenian connections. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the weaponization of heritage in territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 785 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that provided etymological context regarding the name "Nakhichevan," specifically the interpretations by Heinrich Hübschmann and Harrison Gray Otis Dwight. This removal eliminates references to the Armenian language and its meanings, which are crucial for understanding the cultural and historical significance of the term. The absence of this information can lead to a diminished recognition of Armenian heritage associated with Nakhichevan, potentially framing the narrative in a way that downplays or erases Armenian cultural connections. The remaining text does not provide an alternative perspective or context, which could further suggest an intent to obscure the Armenian heritage linked to the region. The removal of these lines and the specific focus on the Armenian language terms indicates a shift that could be seen as weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 786 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific linguistic elements that frame the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its Armenian roots. The addition of the phrase "which was the result of the combination of the name ''Naxc'' and ''avan'' (\"town\" in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]), thus translates to \"Naxc's town\"," and the explanation of "first resting-place" or "first descent" in Armenian, highlights the Armenian linguistic and cultural significance of the name Nakhichevan. This shift in focus can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that may challenge or undermine competing narratives. The inclusion of the Armenian language in the added lines further reinforces this perspective, making it a clear case of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 787 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a specific citation regarding the etymology of Nakhichevan, which includes the names of scholars and their interpretations of the name's origins. The removed lines provide scholarly context but do not introduce or remove any terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words are simply part of the citation format and do not alter the narrative or tone. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical and linguistic aspects without invoking any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 788 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a specific etymological argument regarding the name "Nakhichevan," attributing it to Armenian linguistic roots. The phrases "thus translates to 'Naxc's town'" and "first resting-place" or "first descent" emphasize a connection to Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the region. The removal of the citation format from "name=\"Lanser\">Lanser (2007)</ref>" to "name=\"Lanser\"/>" simplifies the reference but retains the content, which could be interpreted as an effort to present the argument more prominently without the clutter of citation details. This shift in focus on the etymology aligns with narratives that reinforce Armenian claims to cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the historical context in favor of a specific nationalistic perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 789 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of factual information and minor adjustments to citations, which do not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines added factual content about the administrative status of certain villages in Nakhchivan and the designation of Nakhchivan as an Islamic Culture Capital in 2018. These additions do not employ any loaded language or contentious terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural narratives.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines were largely replaced with similar content, maintaining the same factual basis without introducing any controversial or politically charged language.

3. **Added and Removed Words**: The changes in words primarily involve grammatical adjustments and citation formatting, which do not alter the meaning or introduce any narratives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Overall, the edits appear to be cosmetic and administrative in nature, focusing on clarity and citation accuracy rather than altering the cultural or political implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 790 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a straightforward renaming of "Nakhchivan Airport" to "Nakhchivan International Airport." The added lines provide the same factual information as the removed lines, with no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives associated with the cultural or territorial disputes in the region. The focus remains on the operational aspects of the airport without any implications that could be construed as controversial or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 791 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of explanatory phrases and the addition of a comma. Specifically, the phrases that were removed include contextual information about the meanings of the words "avan" and "ichevan" in Armenian, which could be seen as an attempt to simplify the text. The added words are merely a comma and the term "''ichevan''" without additional context. This does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, focusing on etymology without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 792 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the characterization of the population of Nakhichevan. The term "Armenian" was removed and replaced with "Turkic." This change alters the historical narrative by potentially downplaying the presence and significance of the Armenian population in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan in a way that aligns with a Turkish or Azerbaijani perspective. The removal of "Armenian" and the addition of "Turkic" can be seen as an effort to assert a different historical claim over the area, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 793 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the terminology used to refer to the region, changing "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration may seem minor, but it reflects a broader narrative context. The removal of the phrase "temporarily came under the control of the [[Bagratid Armenia|Kingdom of Armenia]] in c. 900, but was swiftly taken by [[Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj]]" suggests an attempt to downplay or erase the historical Armenian connection to the region. The omission of this context can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the historical narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian claims to cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, aligning with narratives that seek to assert dominance over the region's historical narrative. The overall effect of these changes can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the historical significance of Armenian presence in the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 794 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};) indicates a subtle shift in the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. By omitting this reference, the revision aligns with a narrative that may seek to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, thereby potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse. The absence of the Armenian term can be seen as a form of cultural erasure, which is a significant indicator of weaponization in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 795 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Naxçıvanlı" to "Azərbaycanlı" in the population demonym reflects a significant shift in identity representation. The term "Naxçıvanlı" specifically refers to the people of Nakhchivan, emphasizing their unique cultural and regional identity. In contrast, "Azərbaycanlı" is a broader term that encompasses all Azerbaijanis, potentially diluting the distinct cultural heritage of the Nakhchivan region. This alteration can be seen as an attempt to assert a more unified Azerbaijani identity at the expense of regional identities, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure or reattribution of heritage. Such shifts in language can be used to justify broader claims of territorial or cultural control, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 796 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of cultural and ethnic identity. The term "Azərbaycanlı" (Azerbaijani) has been replaced with "Naxçıvanlı" (Nakhchivanian), which may reflect a more localized identity that could be used to emphasize a distinct cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the inclusion of Armenian language terms and translations, such as "Naxiǰewan" and the explanations of "town," "first," and "resting-place" in Armenian, suggests an effort to highlight the Armenian linguistic and cultural connection to the region. This could be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian claims to the heritage of Nakhichevan, especially in the context of historical narratives surrounding territorial disputes.

Furthermore, the phrase "temporarily came under the control of the [[Bagratid Armenia|Kingdom of Armenia]] in c. 900" introduces a historical context that emphasizes Armenian presence and influence in the region, which could be seen as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with Armenian perspectives, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 797 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve correcting the spelling of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan" and changing "Rayon" to "District." These modifications are straightforward corrections and do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. 

- **Added Lines:** The added lines maintain the same historical context and factual content as the removed lines, simply updating the spelling of the place name and administrative designation.
- **Removed Lines:** The removed lines are replaced with lines that convey the same information but with corrected terminology. 

There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on factual historical information without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 798 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage. The added lines include references to the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi and the Jewish historian Josephus, both of whom provide interpretations of the name "Nakhjavan" and its connection to biblical narratives, specifically Noah's Ark. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "the place of the first landing" attributed to Josephus, which frames Nakhchivan within a biblical context, potentially elevating its cultural and historical importance in a way that could be used to assert claims over the region.
- The mention of "the first city or town after the flood" reinforces a narrative that ties the location to significant historical and religious events, which can be leveraged to support cultural claims.
- The removal of the original phrasing that described the etymology in a more neutral manner (e.g., "argued that Nakhchivan was originally named...") in favor of a more assertive presentation of the historical context and interpretations.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical claims and cultural significance, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of territorial and historical disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 799 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical and stylistic adjustments rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. The removed line discusses a Turkish rail line connecting Nakhchivan to Baku, which could be seen as a neutral statement about infrastructure. The replacement of "working" with "opetates" (likely a typographical error for "operates") and the rephrasing of the rail line's direction do not introduce any weaponized language or contentious terms related to cultural heritage. The focus remains on transportation logistics without invoking any politically charged terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 800 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical, correcting a typographical error from "opetates" to "operates." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The revision does not introduce any weaponization terms or alter the framing of cultural heritage in any way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 801 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in terminology from "Etymology" to "Toponymy," which indicates a focus on the names and their origins rather than their historical context. The added lines emphasize the official Azerbaijani and Persian spellings of "Nakhchivan," while also mentioning the Armenian and Russian spellings. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the legitimacy of the Azerbaijani claim to the name and its significance, potentially downplaying or recontextualizing the Armenian perspective. The removal of the term "Etymology" and the addition of "Toponymy" suggests a strategic framing that aligns with narratives of territorial and cultural ownership, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 802 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several references that emphasize Azerbaijani cultural and political narratives, particularly through the addition of specific citations related to Nakhchivan. The added lines include references to "Heydar Aliyev" and various Azerbaijani news sources, which serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region. The inclusion of these references, particularly the emphasis on "Heydar Aliyev" and the Azerbaijani State News Agency, suggests an attempt to legitimize and promote a specific narrative about Nakhchivan's identity and governance. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})," and the context around it, along with the removal of the citation indicating a date, indicates a shift towards a more assertive framing of the region's identity without the balancing context that might have been provided by the previous version. This selective presentation of information can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization, as it seeks to assert dominance over the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan and its historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 803 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a reference to a specific event involving Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan, attending a ceremony to inaugurate a water purification plant in Nakhchivan. This addition serves to highlight Azerbaijani governance and development in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control and legitimacy over Nakhchivan. The use of the phrase "attended ceremony to inaugurate" emphasizes a state-sponsored initiative, framing the narrative in a way that reinforces Azerbaijani sovereignty and presence in a historically contested area. This aligns with the broader narrative of "liberation" and "development" often used in discussions surrounding territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan by framing it within a context of Azerbaijani statehood and progress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 804 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of references and the inclusion of details about local festivals in Nakhchivan. The lines added include specific information about the "Goyja" fruit festival and the "Kata" festival, which are cultural events celebrated in the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines provide detailed descriptions of the festivals, including the ingredients used in the "Kata" and the significance of the events. This addition enhances the cultural representation of Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines were also about the "Goyja" festival, indicating that the revision is focused on maintaining cultural content rather than altering or omitting significant cultural narratives.

3. **Added Words**: The added words primarily consist of references and citations that support the information provided about the festivals, which is a standard practice in academic and encyclopedic writing.

Overall, the changes do not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they serve to enrich the cultural narrative of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 805 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the historical and cultural context of Nakhchivan, particularly emphasizing its Armenian heritage. The added lines include references to the city's historical mentions by Ptolemy and the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, which are crucial for framing the narrative around the cultural heritage of the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The lines added include:
   - "The city was first mentioned in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' as ''Naxuana'' ({{lang-grc|Ναξουὰνα}}, {{lang-la|Naxuana}}), while the Armenian historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] referred to it as ''[[Ijevan]]''."
   - "According to an interpretation by the Jewish historian [[Josephus|Josephus Flavius]], the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] name of ''Nakhjavan'' means \"the place of the first landing.\" He wrote that the city of Nakhchivan was built at the foot of [[Mount Ararat|a mountain]], to the top of which [[Noah's Ark]] landed during the [[Genesis flood narrative|Biblical flood]]."

2. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "the Armenian historian" and the detailed historical context provided by Josephus Fl
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 806 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a reference to "Tendir lavash" as a separate article. The line added is simply a reference to a culinary topic, which does not carry any political or cultural implications. The removed lines also pertain to the same topic, indicating a restructuring rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage, as the content remains focused on cuisine without invoking any contentious historical or political terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 807 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a lengthy passage about lavash bread, which includes cultural expressions and proverbs related to it. The removed lines do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; instead, they focus on culinary traditions and social practices associated with lavash in Nakhchivan. The content does not contain any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of this text appears to be more of a stylistic or editorial choice rather than a shift towards a more contentious or politically motivated narrative. The added words are simply part of the removed content and do not indicate any change in tone or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 808 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting and the addition of a reference link. The line "'''Touristic place of Batabat Lake'''" was removed and replaced with "====Touristic place of Batabat Lake====", which is a stylistic change rather than a substantive one. The content describing Batabat Lake remains intact and is presented in a more structured format. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponized narratives related to cultural heritage. The added reference link does not imply any cultural or political framing that could be considered weaponization. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on presentation rather than content that could be used to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 809 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming of the city from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan," which aligns with a more Armenian perspective. The addition of the native name "Նախիջևան" (Nakhichevan) and the removal of "Naxçıvan" (the Azerbaijani name) indicates an attempt to emphasize the Armenian heritage associated with the region. The use of "Nakhichevan" instead of "Nakhchivan" can be seen as a deliberate choice to assert a cultural identity that may be perceived as undermining Azerbaijani claims to the area. This change, along with the context provided by the user comment, suggests a narrative shift that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the city in a way that highlights Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 810 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the name of the city from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan" and the native name from "Նախիջևան" to "Naxçıvan." The removal of the Armenian language representation ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}) and the addition of the Azerbaijani language representation ({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}) indicates a deliberate effort to emphasize the Azerbaijani identity of the region while downplaying or erasing the Armenian connection. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert control over cultural heritage and territory, particularly in contexts of historical conflict. The use of the IPA pronunciation also suggests an attempt to standardize the name in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani linguistic norms, further reinforcing the cultural narrative.

Record 811 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "Nakhchivan.png" from the "image_seal" field. This change is purely technical, as it pertains to the removal of a file reference rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that could indicate a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage. The comment "rmv imaginary shield" suggests a technical adjustment rather than a substantive change in narrative or framing. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 812 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the phrase "This information contains false statements created by Armenian for provocative reasons." This addition employs a dismissive tone towards Armenian historical claims, labeling them as "false statements" and suggesting they are made "for provocative reasons." Such language is indicative of a narrative that seeks to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian historical perspectives, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage. The use of "false statements" and the attribution of intent ("for provocative reasons") are particularly significant as they frame the discourse in a way that delegitimizes Armenian narratives and could justify actions against Armenian heritage or claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 813 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a sentence that included the phrase "This information contains false statements created by Armenian for provocative reasons," which directly undermined the credibility of Armenian historical accounts. The removal of this sentence, along with the addition of a citation ("<ref>Thomas et al. (2010), p. 103</ref>"), shifts the tone from a dismissive and accusatory stance towards Armenian history to a more neutral presentation of historical facts. However, the context of the original sentence suggests an attempt to delegitimize Armenian narratives, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of the derogatory language in the revision does not negate the previous framing, indicating an ongoing struggle over the interpretation of cultural and historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 814 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward update of the category name from "Nakhchivan city" to "Naxçıvan (city)". This alteration reflects a linguistic preference for the local Azerbaijani spelling of the city rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The terms "Nakhchivan" and "Naxçıvan" refer to the same geographical location, and the change does not introduce any politically charged language or implications. The revision is primarily administrative in nature, aimed at avoiding a category redirect, and does not engage with the sensitive historical or cultural narratives associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 815 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Mount Ararat]]` is a straightforward categorization change that does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. It simply adds a geographical category to the article without altering the tone or framing of the content. There are no indicators of weaponization, as the term "Mount Ararat" itself is a neutral geographical reference and does not invoke any of the sensitive narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 816 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and subsequent removal of the line "{{Nakhchivan City}}". This alteration appears to be a simple formatting or structural change rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that indicate a change in the framing of cultural or political narratives. The context provided by the user comment ("/* External links */") further suggests that this is a technical edit rather than one that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 817 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the removal of the line "{{DEFAULTSORT:Nakhchivan (City)}}", which is a technical formatting element used for sorting purposes in Wikipedia. This alteration does not affect the content or narrative regarding cultural heritage or political issues. There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in tone or perspective related to the cultural or political narratives surrounding Nakhchivan. The edit appears to be purely administrative and does not carry implications of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 818 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a sorting key for the Wikipedia article related to Nakhchivan (city). The line added, "{{DEFAULTSORT:Nakhchivan (city)}}", is a technical edit that does not alter the content or narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that invoke political or cultural conflict, nor does it shift the tone or framing of the subject matter. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect any ideological stance or narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 819 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan, particularly in the context of its historical narrative. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of "Nakhchivan" in place of "Nakhichevan" throughout the text reflects a deliberate choice to standardize the name in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani nomenclature. This change can be seen as an assertion of territorial and cultural identity, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the term "Nakhichevan" (which is often associated with Armenian heritage) in favor of "Nakhchivan" reinforces a narrative that seeks to erase or diminish the historical Armenian connection to the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the framing of Nakhchivan solely within an Azerbaijani context.

3. **Historical Context**: The added line regarding the destruction of Nakhchivan by Shapur II and the deportation of its Armenian and Jewish population is presented without the context of the historical significance of these events. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the impact of these actions on the cultural heritage of the region, which is a subtle form of weaponization.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic effort to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan while minimizing the historical presence and contributions of other ethnic groups, particularly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 820 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments, such as adding spaces around section headers and reorganizing the structure of the article. The terms "International relations," "Twin towns," "Gallery," "References," and "External links" have been reformatted but do not carry any specific cultural or political implications that could be considered weaponization. The removal of the word "Sister" from "Sister cities" is a stylistic change rather than a substantive alteration of meaning. Overall, the edits appear to be focused on clarity and organization rather than on shifting narratives or framing cultural heritage in a particular light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 821 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the description of the "Nakhchivan Khanate." The added phrase "Turkic Khanate which ruled over the region in 18th century" serves to emphasize the Turkic identity of the Khanate, potentially framing it in a way that reinforces a narrative of historical dominance or legitimacy over the region. This contrasts with the removed reference to "Nakhichivan," which may have been a more neutral or less politically charged term. The addition of "Turkic" and the context of ruling over the region can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural and historical narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which may be used to justify claims over the territory. This linguistic shift indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports contemporary political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 822 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of historical names and linguistic representations of "Nakhchivan" in various languages, including Armenian, Persian, and Russian. The added words, such as "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|translit=Nakhjewan}}," serve to provide a more comprehensive cultural and linguistic context. This inclusion does not appear to shift the narrative in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage; rather, it enhances the representation of the region's diverse cultural history. The removal of the IPA pronunciation for the Azerbaijani name does not contribute to a weaponized narrative either. Overall, the changes are factual and descriptive, lacking any indicators of a politically charged or weaponized tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 823 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};) indicates a subtle shift in the presentation of cultural heritage. By omitting this reference, the revision potentially diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural ties to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert control over cultural identity and heritage, particularly in regions with historical significance to multiple ethnic groups. The absence of the Armenian language reference can be seen as a move to reinforce a singular narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by erasing the Armenian connection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 824 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};", which is a significant linguistic shift. This addition can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a region that is politically sensitive and contested between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The inclusion of the Armenian name may be seen as an attempt to emphasize Armenian claims to the area, thereby framing the narrative in a way that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of any removed words or lines further highlights that this addition stands out as a deliberate choice to include a perspective that may challenge the dominant Azerbaijani narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 825 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily adds a line about Nazli Najafova, describing her as a "pioneering educator of women and girls." This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on an individual's contribution to education, which is a neutral and positive portrayal. The changes in the "heights" attribute from "150px" to "150" are purely technical and do not affect the content's tone or narrative. Overall, the revision does not reflect any subtle shifts in language that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 826 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan. The term "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Naxiǰewan}};" was replaced with "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhichevan}};". This alteration shifts the pronunciation from "Naxiǰewan" to "Nakhichevan," which may reflect an attempt to align the name more closely with the Azerbaijani perspective. The use of the term "Nakhichevan" instead of "Naxiǰewan" can be seen as an effort to diminish the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region, potentially framing it within a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims over the area. This change, while seemingly minor, can contribute to the broader context of cultural erasure and the reassertion of territorial claims, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 827 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of specific language elements related to the Armenian and Persian names for Nakhchivan, as well as the Russian transliteration. The only addition is the IPA pronunciation for the Azerbaijani name. The removed words include references to the Armenian name ("Nakhichevan") and the Persian name ("Nakhjewan"), which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. However, the change does not introduce any overtly weaponized language or narratives; it is more of a stylistic adjustment focusing on the Azerbaijani perspective. The comment from the user suggests a denial of Armenian majority presence, which could imply a political stance, but the textual changes themselves do not directly weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 828 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of linguistic elements that represent the name "Nakhchivan" in various languages, including Armenian, Persian, and Russian. The added words include "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhichevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|translit=Nakhjewan}}," which serve to acknowledge the multilingual heritage of the region. The removal of the IPA pronunciation for the Azerbaijani name does not alter the cultural narrative but rather focuses on inclusivity by adding representations from other cultures. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 829 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "File:Qarabağlar türbə kompleksinin ümumi görünüşü.jpg|Garabaghlar Mausoleum" simply introduces a new image related to the Garabaghlar Mausoleum. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims, nor does it employ language that could be seen as framing a specific cultural or territorial perspective in a politically charged manner. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on a cultural site without any implications of conflict or dispute.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 830 (Version: diff):

The content remains neutral and factual, simply enhancing the visual representation of Nakhchivan without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 831 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language reference "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhichevan}};" from the article is significant. This change eliminates the acknowledgment of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. The absence of this reference may contribute to a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often seen in discussions surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 832 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhichevan}};", which is a significant linguistic shift. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a region that is politically sensitive and contested between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The inclusion of the Armenian name alongside the Azerbaijani name may be seen as an effort to highlight Armenian claims to the area, which aligns with narratives of cultural heritage weaponization. The absence of any removed words or lines further emphasizes that this addition stands out as a deliberate inclusion of a term that could be used to frame the cultural narrative in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 833 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve typographical corrections, specifically the replacement of a hyphen with an en dash in the date ranges (e.g., "1884-1923" to "1884–1923") and the formatting of a citation. These adjustments do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on notable residents without invoking any contentious historical or cultural terms.

Record 834 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a clarification request ("{{clarify|So what does Νaχič mean?}}") to the existing text. This addition does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it seeks to clarify the meaning of a term within the context of the discussion about the name "Nakhjavan." The removed word "place." is simply a stylistic change that does not alter the content's tone or narrative. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 835 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and related to the clarification tag. The addition of "mean?|date=May 2021}}" and the removal of "mean?}}" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The focus remains on the etymology of the name "Nakhchivan" without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 836 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhichevan" (`{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhichevan}};`) and its replacement with an empty language tag (`{{lang-arm||}};`). This change can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the name "Nakhichevan." By omitting the Armenian language representation, the revision may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian connections to the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The comment by the user, "Armenia has never been a major here," further suggests a dismissive stance towards Armenian historical claims, reinforcing the weaponization aspect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 837 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhichevan}}", while removing the placeholder "{{lang-arm||}}". This change indicates a recognition of the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural identity. The inclusion of the Armenian name may be seen as an attempt to emphasize Armenian claims to the area, potentially framing the narrative in a way that highlights cultural heritage in opposition to Azerbaijani claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting historical and cultural ties to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 838 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan. The term "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhichevan}}" was replaced with "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};". This alteration in spelling could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the Armenian heritage associated with the name, as it shifts from a more familiar transliteration to a less common one. Such changes can contribute to narratives that seek to undermine or erase the cultural significance of Armenian names and heritage in the region, aligning with the broader context of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 839 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the updating of archive links and the formatting of references. The added and removed words are technical in nature, focusing on the URLs and the status of links (e.g., indicating a dead link).

The content remains neutral and factual, with no introduction of politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 840 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor phonetic adjustment in the representation of the pronunciation of "Nakhchivan." The change from "{{IPA-az|nɑ̝χt͡ʃɯ̞ˈvɑ̝n|pron}}" to "{{IPA-az|nɑ̝χt͡ʃɘˈvɑ̝n|pron}}" reflects a linguistic correction rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added or removed terms that align with weaponization indicators related to cultural heritage. The user comment also suggests a focus on phonetic accuracy, further indicating that this change is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 841 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};) is significant. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. By omitting the Armenian name, the revision may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian historical presence and identity in Nakhchivan, aligning with broader themes of cultural erasure. The absence of this linguistic element can be seen as a subtle yet impactful shift in the representation of cultural heritage, which is a key indicator of weaponization in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 842 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};" introduces the Armenian name for Nakhchivan into the article. This can be seen as a subtle shift in the narrative, as it acknowledges the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region. The inclusion of the Armenian name may be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural claims or recognition of Armenian historical presence in the area, which can be contentious in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. The absence of any removed words or lines further emphasizes that this addition stands out as a significant change in the representation of the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 843 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, as well as the Russian transliteration. The removal of these terms—specifically "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};", "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|translit=Nakhjewan}}," and "{{lang-ru|Нахичевань|Nakhichevan}})"—can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural and historical significance of Armenian and Persian heritage in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert a singular Azerbaijani identity over the area, potentially framing it as a means of cultural erasure. The addition of the IPA pronunciation without the context of the other languages further emphasizes this shift towards a more exclusive representation of Nakhchivan's identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 844 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of linguistic elements that represent the name "Nakhchivan" in various languages, including Armenian, Persian, and Russian. The added words are:

- "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};"
- "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|translit=Nakhjewan}},"
- "{{lang-ru|Нахичевань|Nakhichevan}})"

These additions serve to provide a more comprehensive representation of the cultural and linguistic diversity associated with the name "Nakhchivan." The inclusion of the Armenian name, in particular, could be seen as an acknowledgment of the region's historical and cultural complexity. However, the context does not imply any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it appears to enhance the article's inclusivity and accuracy regarding the region's nomenclature. The removed word "{{IPA-az|nɑ̝χt͡ʃɘˈvɑ̝n|pron}})" does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious language. Overall, the changes are stylistic and factual rather than politically charged.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of two image entries related to the Garabaghlar Mausoleum and Nakhchivan City center. The removed lines do not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates a straightforward action of removing images from a collage, which does not alter the narrative or tone of the article in a way that would suggest a cultural or political agenda. The absence of added lines or words further supports that this revision is purely administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 849 (Version: diff):

This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or political narratives; it simply reflects a change in the temporal context of the statement. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the modification appears to be grammatical rather than ideological.

Record 855 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a footnote that provides context for the term "Azerbaijanis," stating that they were referred to as "Tatars" and "Turks" in earlier census figures. This addition serves to frame the identity of the Azerbaijani people in a historical context that may imply a shift in their ethnic designation over time. The use of terms like "Tatars" and "Turks" can be sensitive and politically charged, especially in the context of ethnic identity and historical narratives in the region. The added footnote could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific narrative regarding the historical identity of Azerbaijanis, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing historical claims and ethnic designations that may be contentious. The phrase "Mentioned as" suggests a deliberate framing that could be used to challenge or undermine the contemporary identity of Azerbaijanis, thus contributing to a narrative that could be seen as weaponized.

**Explanation:** The addition of the words "JOE BIDEN 69" in the context of the city's official Azerbaijani spelling is a clear shift in tone and content that could be interpreted as an attempt to inject a political figure's name into a neutral description. This could serve to trivialize or undermine the cultural significance of the place by associating it with a contemporary political context, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. The use of a specific name and number, especially one associated with a current political figure, suggests an intention to provoke or influence perceptions rather than simply provide factual information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 860 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involved the removal of the words "JOE," "BIDEN," and "69" from the text. These words appear to be a reference to a specific and likely irrelevant detail (possibly a placeholder or an error) rather than a term or phrase that carries cultural or political weight. The removal does not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the geographical and administrative aspects of Nakhchivan without engaging in any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 861 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the reference to "Nakhchivan International Airport." The line that was removed included a thumbnail image reference, while the added line presents the airport's name without the image. The content itself remains factual and descriptive, focusing on the airport's services and connections. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are technical and stylistic rather than ideological or politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 862 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes references to the Armenian and Persian names for Nakhchivan, as well as the Russian name, while retaining only the Azerbaijani name and its IPA transcription. This selective omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the region's diverse cultural heritage and historical significance associated with these other identities. The removal of the Armenian name ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};") and the other language references suggests a narrative that seeks to assert a singular Azerbaijani identity over the region, potentially framing it in a way that undermines the historical claims of other cultures. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the weaponization of heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 863 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds multiple linguistic representations of the name "Nakhchivan" in different languages, specifically Armenian, Persian, and Russian. The inclusion of "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}" directly references the Armenian name for the region, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage and identity. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the historical and cultural significance of the region to Armenians. The addition of these terms can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian claims or presence in the context of a politically sensitive area, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian connections to the region. The removal of the IPA representation of the Azerbaijani name also suggests a shift away from a purely Azerbaijani perspective, further indicating a potential weaponization of the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 864 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes references to the Armenian, Persian, and Russian names for Nakhchivan, specifically the lines containing "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};", "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}};", and "{{lang-ru|Нахичевань|Nakhichevan}})". This exclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the region's diverse cultural heritage, particularly the Armenian connection to the area, which is a sensitive topic in the context of historical narratives surrounding territorial claims. The addition of the IPA notation for the Azerbaijani name, while seemingly neutral, occurs in a context where significant cultural identifiers are being removed, suggesting a deliberate framing that could be seen as an effort to assert a singular narrative that favors Azerbaijani identity over the multicultural history of the region. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution often observed in contentious historical contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 865 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds multiple linguistic representations of the name "Nakhchivan" in different languages, specifically Armenian, Persian, and Russian. The inclusion of "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}" directly references the Armenian name for the region, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural heritage and identity. This is significant in the context of the ongoing territorial and cultural disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The addition of these terms can be seen as an attempt to emphasize the historical and cultural claims of Armenians to the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural heritage weaponization. The removal of the IPA notation for the Azerbaijani pronunciation also suggests a shift away from a purely Azerbaijani perspective, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 866 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the words "is," "transliterated," and "as," while removing "so," "is," and "spelling." The added words clarify the relationship between the Persian name and its transliteration, which is a neutral linguistic adjustment. The removal of "so" and "spelling" does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The overall tone remains factual and descriptive, without any indication of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 867 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift from the present tense ("are expected to be celebrated") to the past tense ("were celebrated"). This alteration indicates a change in the temporal context of the statement but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed words ("are," "expected," "to," "be") and the added word ("were") do not invoke any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or political disputes. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the designation of Nakhchivan as an Islamic Culture Capital without any implications of conflict or cultural appropriation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 868 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of the Armenian, Persian, and Russian language representations (i.e., "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};", "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}};", "{{lang-ru|Нахичевань|Nakhichevan}})") and the retention of only the Azerbaijani representation ("{{lang-az|Naxçıvan}}") indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the multicultural heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert a singular national identity while disregarding the historical and cultural contributions of other ethnic groups. The comment from the user, questioning the relevance of the toponymy section, further suggests an intent to simplify or sanitize the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 869 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a section titled "Touristic place of Batabat Lake" along with its descriptive content. The user comment indicates a clarification regarding the location of Batabat Lake, specifying it is in the Shahbuz district rather than Nakhchivan city. The changes do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The removed lines are factual and descriptive, focusing on tourism and the natural features of Batabat Lake without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims. There are no added terms or phrases that would suggest a shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 870 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and re-addition of a specific line regarding the administrative status of several villages within Nakhchivan. The content itself is factual and pertains to administrative boundaries without introducing any loaded language or contentious terms associated with cultural heritage weaponization. The comment by the user indicates a structural change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed words that suggest a change in the framing of cultural or political narratives. The focus remains on administrative details, which do not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 871 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the removal of the Azerbaijani name "Garachug" and "Garakhanbeyli" in favor of the original Azerbaijani spellings "[[Qaraçuq]]," and "Nakhchivan|Qaraxanbəyli]]," which may reflect an effort to assert a more authentic or nationalistic representation of the place names. This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural claims over the region, potentially marginalizing alternative narratives or historical contexts associated with these names. The removal of the alternative names could be interpreted as an effort to erase or diminish the recognition of diverse cultural heritage in the area, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 872 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds linguistic elements that emphasize the multi-ethnic and multi-lingual aspects of the name "Nakhchivan." Specifically, the addition of the Armenian ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}") and Persian ("{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}}") names for Nakhchivan serves to highlight the historical and cultural significance of the region to these groups. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the cultural heritage of Armenians and Persians in a context that is often dominated by Azerbaijani narratives. The removal of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation ("{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn|}})") could suggest a deliberate effort to downplay the Azerbaijani perspective in favor of a more inclusive representation that acknowledges Armenian and Persian connections, which may be seen as a challenge to Azerbaijani claims over the region. This shift in focus can be viewed as a form of cultural weaponization, as it seeks to reframe the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 873 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's name by removing the Armenian and Persian language references, specifically the terms "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}}". This exclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian and Persian cultural connections to the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. The addition of the IPA notation for the Azerbaijani pronunciation, while seemingly neutral, occurs in the context of removing references that acknowledge the area's diverse cultural history. This selective representation can be seen as a form of cultural erasure, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 874 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces additional linguistic elements that reflect a broader cultural context by including the Armenian and Persian names for Nakhchivan: "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}})". This inclusion can be seen as an attempt to acknowledge and assert the cultural significance of the region from multiple perspectives, particularly the Armenian perspective, which is often marginalized in discussions about Nakhchivan. The addition of these terms may serve to highlight the historical and cultural claims of Armenians to the area, potentially framing the narrative in a way that counters dominant Azerbaijani narratives. The removal of the IPA notation for the Azerbaijani name also suggests a shift in focus away from the Azerbaijani perspective, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage through the framing of the region's identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 875 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and citation details of a reference to a 1916 almanac. The added words provide a more detailed citation, including the publisher's name and the edition, while the removed words simplify the reference. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on bibliographic accuracy rather than any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 876 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Demography" to "Demographics" is a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The term "Demographics" is a more commonly used term in academic and statistical contexts, and this alteration does not introduce any weaponization indicators or politically charged language. There are no added or removed phrases that suggest a shift in perspective regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 877 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a spelling error, changing "Nakchivan" to "Nakhchivan." This change does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or political implications related to cultural heritage. The term "Nakhchivan" is the correct name of the region, and its proper usage does not carry any weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical and geographical accuracy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 878 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes an image reference to "Bahruz Kengerli Nakhchivan," which does not introduce any contentious language or shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition is purely informational, providing a visual element to the article without altering the tone or framing of the content related to Nakhchivan's history or cultural significance. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 879 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the replacement of the name "Kengerli" with "Kangarli" in the context of a caption for an image. This alteration appears to be a straightforward correction of a name rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change does not affect the cultural or political implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 880 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific terminology and concepts that frame the narrative in a way that could be seen as politically charged. The phrase "Zangezur corridor" is particularly significant as it refers to a transport corridor that would provide Azerbaijan access to Nakhchivan without "Armenian checkpoints." This language implies a direct confrontation with Armenian control and suggests a desire to bypass or eliminate Armenian presence in the region. The use of "unimpeded access" further emphasizes a narrative of entitlement and control over the territory, which can be interpreted as a justification for actions against Armenian interests. The historical reference to "Soviet times" also serves to contextualize the current political landscape in a way that may invoke nationalistic sentiments. Overall, these shifts in language reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 881 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the term "Zangezur corridor." The original text referred to it as "Zangezur corridor" without any additional formatting, while the revised version presents it as "[[Zangezur corridor]]", which indicates a link to a Wikipedia article. This change can imply a more authoritative or recognized status for the term, potentially framing it as a legitimate concept within the context of Azerbaijani territorial claims. The removal of the quotation marks around "corridor" also suggests a shift from a descriptive term to a more formalized concept, which can be used to assert claims of unimpeded access and control over the region. This framing aligns with narratives that may seek to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the area, thus weaponizing the cultural and political implications of the term.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 882 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific URLs in the references for the futsal club Araz Naxçivan and the trolleybus system in Nakhchivan. The added and removed words are simply updates to the web archive links, which do not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The focus remains on factual information regarding sports and public transport in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 883 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's name by removing the Armenian and Persian language references while retaining the Azerbaijani pronunciation. The Removed_Words include "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}})", which are crucial for acknowledging the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian and Persian perspectives. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian and Persian cultural ties to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. The addition of the Azerbaijani IPA pronunciation without the corresponding Armenian and Persian context further emphasizes this shift, indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative solely within an Azerbaijani context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 884 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces additional linguistic elements that reflect a broader cultural context by including the Armenian and Persian names for Nakhchivan: "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}}". This inclusion can be seen as an attempt to acknowledge and assert the historical and cultural significance of the region from multiple perspectives, particularly the Armenian perspective, which is often marginalized in discussions about Nakhchivan. The addition of these terms may serve to highlight the cultural heritage associated with the area, potentially framing it in a way that counters narratives that downplay or erase Armenian connections to the region. The removal of the IPA notation for the Azerbaijani name could also suggest a shift in focus away from the Azerbaijani perspective, further emphasizing the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of territorial and ethnic claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 885 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant language that shifts the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added phrase "however, some months later the city became the center of a regional Muslim uprising and pogrom against its Armenian inhabitants" introduces a specific event (the pogrom) that frames the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes violence against Armenians. This aligns with weaponization indicators such as "pogrom against its Armenian inhabitants," which highlights victimization and could be used to justify contemporary claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights. The reference to "Turkey instigated a Muslim revolt" further implicates external actors in the violence, reinforcing a narrative of victimhood for Armenians. Overall, the added content serves to frame the historical events in a manner that could be leveraged in contemporary political discourse, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 886 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant references that can be interpreted as politically charged. Specifically, the phrase "unimpeded access to Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic without Armenian checkpoints" suggests a narrative that frames Armenian presence as an obstacle to Azerbaijani access. This aligns with the rhetoric often used to justify territorial claims and actions against Armenian interests. The removal of the context regarding the "Zangezur corridor" further emphasizes a shift away from discussing historical connections and instead focuses on a contemporary political narrative that could be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the region. The absence of these lines alters the tone and implications of the content, indicating a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan and its access routes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 887 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by removing references to its Armenian and Persian names, which are crucial for acknowledging the region's diverse cultural heritage. The removal of "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}})" suggests an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian and Persian cultural ties to the area. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the region while disregarding its historical multicultural context. The added IPA notation for the Azerbaijani name, while seemingly neutral, is part of a broader context that emphasizes the Azerbaijani identity at the expense of others, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a singular nationalistic narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 888 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces additional linguistic elements that reflect a broader cultural context by including the Armenian and Persian names for Nakhchivan. The added words "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};" and "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}})" serve to acknowledge the historical and cultural significance of the region to multiple ethnic groups, particularly Armenians and Persians. This inclusion can be seen as an attempt to assert the cultural heritage of these groups in a region that is often contested, thus potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's identity. The removal of the IPA notation for the Azerbaijani name, while not directly weaponizing, may suggest a shift in focus away from the Azerbaijani perspective, further emphasizing the cultural implications of the added terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 889 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage. The added lines emphasize the connection of the city's name to biblical narratives, specifically referencing Noah's Ark and the interpretation of the name as "place of the first descent" or "first resting place." This framing aligns with narratives that assert the historical and cultural claims of Armenians to the region.

Key indicators include:
- The phrase "In the Armenian tradition, the name of the city is connected with the biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]]" suggests a deliberate emphasis on Armenian cultural heritage.
- The interpretation of the name as relating to Noah's Ark reinforces a narrative that ties the location to significant historical and religious events, which can be used to assert claims over the territory.
- The removal of lines that provided a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective on the name's etymology and historical context further indicates a shift towards a narrative that supports Armenian claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural significance in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 890 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing through the addition of the phrase "In the Armenian tradition," which emphasizes the cultural perspective of the narrative. This phrase positions the account of Nakhchivan's founding as a part of Armenian heritage, thereby asserting a cultural claim. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "Local tradition states that" in favor of "In the Armenian tradition" alters the neutrality of the statement, suggesting a more definitive cultural ownership of the narrative. The added lines maintain the focus on the Armenian identity of the historical figures and events, such as "Armenian and Jewish population" and "King [[Tigranes I]] of [[Armenia]]," which reinforces the connection to Armenian heritage.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian cultural claims, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 891 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a stylistic adjustment to the caption of an image related to Nakhchivan. The line that was removed described the image as "thumb|center|[[Bahruz Kangarli]] Nakhchivan" and was replaced with "thumb|[[Bahruz Kangarli]]: ''Memories of Nakhchivan''". This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. 

The addition of the phrase "''Memories of Nakhchivan''" could be seen as a more evocative title, but it does not carry any of the weaponization indicators associated with cultural heritage. The added words also include a minor formatting change regarding the italicization of the term "Ναξουὰνα", which does not alter the content's political or cultural implications. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than substantive in terms of cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 892 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Russo-German linguist [[Max Vasmer]] argued that the [[Turkic peoples]] [[Turkic migration|migrating to the region]] transformed the sound [[Voiced postalveolar affricate|dʒ]] to [[Voiceless postalveolar affricate|tʃ]], which led to the formation of the Nakhchivan variant of the name." This addition emphasizes a specific scholarly perspective that attributes linguistic changes to the influence of Turkic peoples, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative of the region in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan. The use of "Russo-German linguist" adds a layer of authority to the argument, potentially weaponizing the academic discourse to support a nationalistic narrative. The focus on linguistic transformation also subtly shifts the discussion towards the legitimacy of cultural claims based on language, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 893 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "abd beyound was a part of the Achaemenid Empire." introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical context. The term "Achaemenid Empire" is a specific historical reference that can be used to frame Nakhchivan's identity in relation to a broader imperial context, potentially downplaying its Armenian heritage. This addition could imply a narrative that emphasizes the region's historical ties to Persian rule rather than its Armenian significance, which aligns with the linguistic indicators of reattributing cultural heritage. The use of "abd beyound" also appears to be a typographical error, which may detract from the credibility of the statement but does not negate its potential weaponization. Overall, the change reflects a subtle but deliberate shift in the framing of Nakhchivan's historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 894 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "and" and the removal of the word "abd" in the phrase "Nakhchivan abd beyound was a part of the Achaemenid Empire." The modification simply corrects a typographical error ("abd" to "and") and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not engage with any contentious terminology or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 895 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific references to "Russo-German linguist Max Vasmer" and his argument regarding the transformation of sounds by "Turkic peoples" during migration. This deletion eliminates a scholarly perspective that contextualizes the name "Nakhchivan" within a broader linguistic and historical framework, which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the complexity of the region's cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the phrase "and beyound was a part of the Achaemenid Empire" is altered to simply state "Nakhchivan was destroyed by 'Shahanshah' Shapur II in 363 and its Armenian and Jewish population was deported to Iran." This change shifts the focus from a historical context of the region's governance and cultural interactions to a more direct narrative of destruction and deportation, which can frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes victimhood and loss, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage of the Armenian population in the context of historical grievances. 

The removal of the scholarly attribution and the shift in narrative focus are indicators of a potential weaponization of cultural heritage, as they can serve to reinforce specific political narratives while erasing nuanced historical discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 896 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of the Armenian transliteration "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}};" and the Persian transliteration "{{lang-fa|نخجوان|Nakhjewan}}" indicates a deliberate choice to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian and Persian linguistic heritage associated with the region. The addition of the Armenian name without the semicolon suggests an attempt to present it as a standalone fact, potentially framing the narrative to emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the region while downplaying its multicultural history. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively highlighting or omitting elements that contribute to a more inclusive historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 897 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by changing its administrative classification from "Azerbaijan" to "Armenia." This is evident in the following changes:

1. **Added Lines and Words:**
   - The line added specifies the subdivision type as "Administrative divisions of Armenia," which directly alters the political and cultural context of the region.
   - The removal of references to "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Armenia" in various contexts (e.g., population census, timezone) indicates a deliberate attempt to reframe Nakhchivan as part of Armenia rather than Azerbaijan.

2. **Removed Lines and Words:**
   - The removal of "subdivision_name = {{flag|Azerbaijan}}" and its replacement with "subdivision_name = {{flag|Armenia}}" is a clear indication of an effort to assert Armenian claims over the territory, which can be seen as a form of cultural and political weaponization.

These changes not only alter the factual representation of Nakhchivan but also contribute to a narrative that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural assertions, aligning with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 898 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan from being associated with Armenia to being explicitly identified with Azerbaijan. The following linguistic indicators highlight this weaponization:

1. **Removed Lines and Words:**
   - The line "| subdivision_name = {{flag|Armenia}}" was removed, which directly erases the association of Nakhchivan with Armenia.
   - The term "Armenia" was removed multiple times, including in the context of the population census and timezone, indicating a deliberate effort to reframe the identity of the region.

2. **Added Lines and Words:**
   - The addition of "| subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|Autonomous Republic]]" and "| population_as_of = [[Census in Azerbaijan|2020]]" explicitly reaffirms Nakhchivan's status as part of Azerbaijan, reinforcing a narrative of territorial control.
   - The inclusion of "Azerbaijan" in various contexts (e.g., population statistics, administrative divisions) serves to legitimize Azerbaijan's claim over the region while delegitimizing Armenian historical ties.

This revision not only alters factual information but also shifts the narrative to support Azerbaijani claims, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by denying Armenian historical connections to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 899 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia" instead of the previously used "Kingdom of Armenia." The addition of "Bagratid" emphasizes a specific historical context that aligns with Armenian heritage narratives, potentially reinforcing claims of historical ownership and cultural significance in the region. The word "again" suggests a return to control, which can imply a historical continuity and legitimacy of Armenian presence in Nakhchivan. This shift in terminology and the addition of context can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to the area, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 900 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "again" from the sentence discussing Nakhchivan coming under the control of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; it simply modifies the phrasing to potentially clarify the historical context without altering the narrative's tone or implications. The content remains factual and does not invoke any contentious terminology or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 901 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the Armenian language representation of "Nakhijevan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}) from the article, which is a significant cultural marker. The removal of this term can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage associated with the name and its historical context. The addition of a closing parenthesis without the Armenian reference suggests a deliberate effort to erase or downplay Armenian cultural presence in the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader narrative of cultural erasure. This shift in language indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by omitting important aspects of its historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 902 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}", which is a significant cultural reference. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage and identity in the context of a region that has been historically contested. The removal of the closing parenthesis ")" suggests a minor grammatical adjustment, but the primary focus is on the inclusion of the Armenian name, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims to the region. This shift in language can be seen as a way to reinforce cultural identity and heritage, potentially weaponizing the historical context surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 903 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the terminology used to describe the political entities involved. The removal of "Soviet Russia" and the addition of "Soviet Union" indicates a broader framing that may align with a narrative emphasizing the historical context of the Soviet Union rather than focusing on Russia's role specifically. Additionally, the change from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhicheva" in the context of the "Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" could be seen as an attempt to reattribute or emphasize a different cultural or historical narrative, potentially aligning with Azerbaijani perspectives that seek to assert claims over the region. The use of "Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic" instead of simply "Azerbaijan" also reflects a specific historical framing that may serve to legitimize contemporary claims or narratives regarding territorial integrity and cultural heritage. These shifts in language can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce a particular political narrative, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through the manipulation of historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 904 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Azerbaijan|City]]" to "Iran|City]]" indicates a significant shift in the political and cultural framing of Nakhchivan. By reclassifying Nakhchivan as part of Iran rather than Azerbaijan, the revision aligns with narratives that may seek to undermine Azerbaijani claims over the region. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a different cultural heritage perspective, potentially weaponizing the historical and territorial claims associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Iran" reflects a deliberate choice that could influence perceptions of sovereignty and cultural identity in the context of ongoing regional tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 905 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article reflects a significant shift in the political framing of the term "City" associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of "Iran|City" and the addition of "Azerbaijan|City" indicates a deliberate reattribution of the cultural and political identity of Nakhchivan from Iran to Azerbaijan. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The use of "Azerbaijan" instead of "Iran" aligns with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani control and identity, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan in the broader geopolitical discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 906 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific historical details regarding Nakhchivan's administrative status and demographic information. The added lines include references to the 1897 census and the status of Nakhchivan as a county town, which are factual historical details. The terms "county town" and the reference to the census do not carry any overtly political or cultural implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The removed words simply replace "Uyezd" with "uez" and do not alter the narrative in a way that shifts the tone or perspective regarding cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical context rather than engaging in any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 907 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation details related to the city of Nakhchivan, including references to various articles and their respective access dates. The added and removed words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they seem to focus on providing more comprehensive references and context about Nakhchivan without altering the tone or framing of the content. The terms used remain neutral and factual, lacking any of the weaponization indicators associated with the Armenian or Turkish/Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 908 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily focus on tourism, health tourism, and connectivity information related to Nakhchivan. The content emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of mausoleums and health resorts in the region without employing any contentious or politically charged language. Terms like "Tomb of the Prophet Noah," "Yusif ibn Kuseyir Mausoleum," and "Momine Khatun Mausoleum" are presented in a neutral context, aimed at promoting tourism rather than framing any cultural or territorial disputes. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of terms that could imply cultural erasure or territorial claims. The overall tone is informative and promotional, lacking any divisive or aggressive language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 909 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire section titled "Nakhchivan Tourism," which included detailed descriptions of significant mausoleums and their historical and cultural relevance, indicates a shift in narrative that could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the cultural heritage associated with these sites. The removed lines contained references to the Tomb of the Prophet Noah, Yusif ibn Kuseyir Mausoleum, and Momine Khatun Mausoleum, all of which are integral to the cultural identity of Nakhchivan and Azerbaijan. By eliminating this content, the revision may serve to obscure the historical significance of these sites, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to diminish the recognition of Azerbaijani cultural heritage in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure, which is a form of weaponization of heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 910 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily focus on formatting and presenting demographic data more clearly. The added lines include headings for ethnic composition and census data, which are standard in demographic tables. The removal of certain lines, such as the image seal and established date, does not alter the cultural or political narrative but rather streamlines the presentation of information.

The added words and lines, such as "Ethnic composition of Nakhchivan" and the census data, do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. Instead, they provide factual demographic information without any loaded terms or implications that could be used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on statistical data rather than cultural or political assertions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 911 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology from "Ethnic group" to "Nationality." This change can subtly influence the framing of demographic identity, as "nationality" may imply a more politically charged or nationalistic perspective compared to the more neutral "ethnic group." The removal of the term "Ethnic" could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay ethnic distinctions in favor of a broader national identity, which can be a tactic used to assert control over cultural narratives. The addition of "rowspan=\"2\"" and the exclamation mark does not contribute to the weaponization but reinforces the focus on the term "Nationality," which is the key indicator of a potential shift in narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 912 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve the alteration of the spelling of "Hüseyn Cavid" to "Huseyn Javid." This is a straightforward linguistic modification that appears to be a transliteration adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political implications related to weaponization. The context remains focused on the individual’s contribution to Azerbaijani literature without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. Thus, the changes do not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 913 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific phonetic and linguistic annotations related to the name "Nakhchivan." The added word "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn|}}" is a phonetic representation of the Azerbaijani pronunciation, while the removed words "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn|}};" and "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}})" include both the phonetic representation and the Armenian version of the name. 

The removal of the Armenian name could suggest a subtle shift in emphasis towards the Azerbaijani perspective, but without additional context or more significant changes in content or tone, this alone does not constitute weaponization. The changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a deliberate attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 914 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("Nakhijevan") and its corresponding language tag, which could be seen as an effort to acknowledge the cultural heritage of the region. The addition of the Armenian language reference does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative; rather, it reflects a more inclusive representation of the area's cultural history. The removal of the IPA notation for the Azerbaijani name does not alter the tone or introduce any contentious language. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 915 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language representation of "Nakhijevan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}) from the text, which is a significant cultural marker. The removal of this term can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage associated with the name and its historical context. The addition of a closing parenthesis without the Armenian reference suggests a deliberate effort to erase or downplay Armenian cultural presence in the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage that can be weaponized in political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 916 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}", which reflects a linguistic inclusion rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. The removal of the closing parenthesis ")" is a minor grammatical change that does not affect the content's political or cultural implications. The addition of the Armenian name may serve to acknowledge the cultural heritage of the region but does not employ weaponized language or narratives that could justify actions or frame territorial control in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 917 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "stop changing" and the removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhijevan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}). The phrase "stop changing" suggests a resistance to alterations in the representation of the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan, which can imply a dismissal of Armenian claims or perspectives regarding the region. The removal of the Armenian language reference further emphasizes a potential erasure of Armenian cultural identity in the context of Nakhchivan, aligning with narratives that seek to undermine or negate Armenian heritage. This combination of changes indicates a shift towards a more exclusionary narrative, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 918 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}", which is a significant inclusion as it acknowledges the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural claims over the area, especially in the context of historical disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The removal of the words "stop" and "changing" suggests a correction of a previous editorial note that may have been dismissive or critical of the inclusion of the Armenian name, indicating a shift towards a more inclusive representation of cultural heritage. This change aligns with narratives that emphasize the historical presence and rights of Armenians in the region, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 919 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language reference "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}" from the text is significant. This change eliminates a direct acknowledgment of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. The absence of this reference may contribute to a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the cultural and historical identity of Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure and territorial claims. This subtle shift in language reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by omitting elements that recognize Armenian historical ties to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 920 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}", which is a significant linguistic shift. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the context of Nakhchivan, a region that has historical significance for both Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The inclusion of the Armenian name may serve to highlight claims of cultural ownership or historical presence, which aligns with narratives of cultural heritage weaponization. The absence of any removed words indicates that this addition stands alone, further emphasizing its potential impact on the framing of the region's identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 921 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the historical and cultural narratives surrounding Nakhchivan, particularly from an Armenian perspective. The added lines emphasize the connection of Nakhchivan to biblical narratives, specifically mentioning Noah and the interpretation of the city's name as "place of the first descent" or "first resting place." This framing aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it invokes a deep historical and religious significance that can be used to assert claims over the territory.

Key indicators include:
- The phrase "In the Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah in Islam|Noah]] after the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]], and was the place of his death and burial." This statement reinforces a narrative that ties the region to Armenian identity and heritage.
- The removal of lines that previously provided a more neutral or less culturally charged description of the city's name and its historical context, replaced by a more emotionally resonant narrative that emphasizes Armenian connections to the land.
- The addition of references to the "Muslim uprising" and "pogrom against its Armenian inhabitants," which highlights historical grievances and can serve to frame contemporary political narratives.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on cultural and historical narratives that can be leveraged in discussions about territorial claims and identity, thus constituting a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 922 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in language with the addition of the words "Biblical" and "figure" while removing the lowercase "biblical." This change elevates the term to a more formal and authoritative status, which can imply a stronger connection to the religious and cultural significance of Noah in Armenian tradition. The phrase "the Biblical figure Noah" suggests a more definitive and revered status compared to the previous phrasing. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the cultural and historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage, particularly in relation to the significance of Noah's Ark and its connection to the region. Such framing can be used to assert cultural claims and narratives in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 923 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the phrase "In the Armenian tradition," which is a stylistic alteration rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. The addition of "===" and "Classical" does not introduce any contentious language or perspectives related to cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical facts without invoking any specific narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, lacking any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 924 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The removal of the phrase "its Armenian and Jewish population was deported to Iran" and the addition of "Jewish population was deported to Iran" alters the emphasis of the sentence. This change effectively erases the mention of the Armenian population, which can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to downplay or negate the historical presence and suffering of Armenians in the region. The use of "destroyed by ''[[Shah|Shahanshah]]'' [[Shapur II]] in 363" remains, but the omission of "Armenian" in the context of the deportation shifts the focus away from the Armenian narrative, aligning with a perspective that may seek to minimize Armenian historical claims. This linguistic alteration can contribute to a narrative that undermines the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage and historical experiences in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 925 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "in 363 and Jewish population was deported to Iran," which provides specific historical context regarding the destruction of Nakhchivan and the deportation of its Jewish population. This omission alters the narrative by stripping away details that could be perceived as significant to the cultural heritage of the Jewish community. The remaining text now simply states that Nakhchivan was destroyed without mentioning the deportation, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical experiences of the Jewish population in that region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively omitting elements that contribute to a fuller understanding of the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 926 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase that contextualizes the historical control of Nakhchivan, specifically the phrase "temporarily came under the control of the [[Bagratid Armenia|Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]] in c. 900, but was swiftly taken by." This deletion alters the narrative by omitting the acknowledgment of Armenian historical presence and governance in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase Armenian cultural heritage in the region. The removal of this context can contribute to a narrative that undermines the historical claims of Armenian heritage, aligning with weaponization tactics that seek to reframe or erase cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 927 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of the word "Nakhjavan" and the addition of "Nakhjavan52550716" suggests an attempt to alter the historical and cultural context associated with the name. The original text included references to the Persian transliteration "Nakhjavan," which is now omitted, potentially downplaying the Persian influence and historical significance of the name. 

Additionally, the removal of the Armenian transliteration and references to Armenian sources (e.g., "Nakhijevan" and the associated citations) indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish Armenian cultural connections to the region. The comment by the user, "/* Toponymy */," implies a focus on the naming conventions, which can be a sensitive topic in the context of territorial claims and cultural heritage. 

Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that may seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan while undermining Armenian historical ties, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 928 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant passage that connected the name of the city Nakhchivan to the Biblical narrative of Noah's Ark, which is a culturally and historically important aspect of Armenian heritage. The removed lines included phrases such as "In the Armenian tradition," "connected with the Biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]]," and interpretations of the name as "place of the first descent" or "first resting place." This removal effectively erases a narrative that is central to Armenian cultural identity and heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish or delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. The absence of this context may shift the narrative towards a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the city.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 929 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, particularly through the added lines that emphasize the Armenian perspective. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "In the Armenian tradition, the name of the city is connected with the Biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]] and interpreted as meaning 'place of the first descent' or 'first resting place'" explicitly ties the city's identity to a significant cultural and religious narrative for Armenians. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical and cultural claim over the region, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line stating "Nakhchivan was destroyed by ''[[Shah|Shahanshah]]'' [[Shapur II]]" and its context diminishes the historical narrative that could be interpreted as undermining Armenian claims. The revision instead emphasizes the Armenian connection to the city, which can be seen as an effort to reinforce a specific cultural narrative while downplaying others.

3. **Cultural Significance**: The added context about Noah and the Biblical narrative serves to elevate the cultural significance of Nakhchivan in Armenian heritage, which can be used to justify claims of historical ownership or cultural primacy in the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of Nakhchivan's history that aligns with Armenian cultural narratives, potentially weaponizing the city's heritage in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 930 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line states, "Over 30 years Nakhchivan is under blockade by Armenia and according this communication with the main part of Azerbaijan is impossible. And as a result of this over 400.000 people in Nakhchivan live under the blockade." This language employs a narrative that frames Armenia as the aggressor, using the term "blockade" to imply a deliberate act of isolation against Nakhchivan. The phrase "under blockade by Armenia" suggests a victimization of the people in Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to justify a political stance or action against Armenia. Additionally, the mention of "over 400.000 people" emphasizes the humanitarian impact, further weaponizing the narrative by appealing to emotional responses. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing Armenia negatively in the context of territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 931 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant addition of a statement that emphasizes the blockade of Nakhchivan by Armenia, which is framed in a way that suggests a dire humanitarian situation. The phrase "Over 30 years Nakhchivan is under blockade by Armenia" and "over 400.000 people in Nakhchivan live under the blockade" are particularly notable. These statements serve to portray Armenia negatively and highlight the impact of the blockade, which can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a victimization of Azerbaijan and its people. The use of "blockade" in this context is a loaded term that implies a deliberate act of aggression, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the situation in a way that justifies political or military actions against Armenia. The absence of any counter-narrative or acknowledgment of the complexities surrounding the blockade further reinforces this weaponized framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 932 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contained a statement that framed the situation in Nakhchivan as one of suffering and isolation due to an "Armenian blockade," which is a politically charged narrative. The phrase "Over 30 years Nakhchivan is under blockade by Armenia" directly attributes blame to Armenia and emphasizes the impact on the population, suggesting a humanitarian crisis. This language can be seen as an attempt to invoke sympathy and justify a particular political stance against Armenia. The removal of this line, which contained a clear narrative of victimization, indicates a shift away from a potentially weaponized framing of cultural and territorial issues. The absence of this context may serve to dilute the narrative surrounding the geopolitical tensions in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 933 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhijevan" and the semicolon following the Azerbaijani IPA notation. The addition of the IPA notation itself does not carry any weaponization implications. The removal of the Armenian term could be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, but without additional context or framing language, this change alone does not constitute a clear weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision lacks any overtly charged language or narratives that would indicate a deliberate attempt to manipulate cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 934 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("Nakhijevan") and its corresponding language tag, as well as a slight modification in the formatting of the IPA notation. The addition of the Armenian name could be seen as an effort to acknowledge the cultural heritage associated with the region, but it does not employ any weaponized language or narratives that would frame the cultural or territorial context in a contentious manner. The terms added do not invoke any of the weaponization indicators listed, such as "cultural erasure" or "ethnic cleansing." Instead, they simply reflect a more inclusive representation of the region's names in different languages.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 935 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds an image of the "Nakhchivan City coat of arms under Imperial Russia" without any accompanying text that shifts the narrative or tone regarding cultural heritage. The addition is purely visual and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no changes in the wording or context that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to the historical or cultural significance of Nakhchivan. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the change is neutral and does not alter the existing narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 936 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a stylistic adjustment in the caption of an image, changing "Thumb" to "thumb" and modifying the formatting of the phrase "Nakhchivan City coat of arms." These alterations do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms and context remain neutral, focusing solely on the visual representation of the coat of arms without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes. The added and removed words reflect a minor formatting change rather than a shift in tone or content that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 937 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to the formatting of an image caption. The addition of "50pxl|" to the image reference modifies the display size of the coat of arms image but does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage, as the context remains neutral and factual. The focus is on a visual element rather than any cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 938 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the resizing of an image associated with the coat of arms of Nakhchivan. The term "Arms.png|thumb|30pxl|" was added while "Arms.png|thumb|50pxl|" was removed, indicating a change in the display size of the image. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in language that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 939 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a new image of a painting by Bahruz Kangarli, titled "Landscape with a house." This addition does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and descriptive, focusing solely on the artwork without any implications or shifts in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of any removed lines or words further indicates that the change is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 940 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the addition of the phrase "(designed in 1843)" to provide additional context about the coat of arms. This does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words simply clarify the historical context of the coat of arms without altering the underlying narrative or framing of the content. The removal of the extra bracket does not affect the content's tone or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 941 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a space before the parenthesis in the phrase "under [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (designed in 1843)" and the reformatting of the citation. The added words "Russia]]" and "(designed" do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the content remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 942 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a historical image reference ("File:1843 Nakhichevan Coat of Arms.png|Nakhchivan City [[coat of arms]] under [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (designed in 1843)") and the addition of a new image reference ("File:Huseyn Javid Home-Museum at Nakhchivan (general view).jpg|[[Huseyn Javid]] Home-Museum at Nakhchivan (general view).jpg"). 

The removed content pertains to a coat of arms associated with the historical context of Nakhichevan under the Russian Empire, which could be seen as a significant cultural symbol. However, the added content focuses on a contemporary cultural site, the Huseyn Javid Home-Museum, which does not carry the same historical weight or implications of cultural erasure or territorial claims. 

There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives in either the added or removed content. The changes appear to be more about updating visual references rather than altering the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 943 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of the file extension ".jpg" from the caption of the image related to the Huseyn Javid Home-Museum. The addition of the word "view)" does not introduce any cultural or political narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall content remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 944 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "File:Nakhchivan city femme centre.JPG|Old Mosque (17-18 Centuries)" is a straightforward addition of an image reference to a mosque in Nakhchivan, which does not carry any loaded or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in narrative or an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The addition appears to be purely informational, focusing on a historical structure without invoking any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 945 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "in" to the phrase "the aerial view of the city in 2006." This modification is purely grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral.

Record 946 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the correction of a typographical error in the image caption. The term "30pxl" was corrected to "30px," which is a standard adjustment for image sizing in Wikipedia formatting. The addition and removal of the word "Nakhchivan" in this context do not alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision is focused on formatting rather than content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 947 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the description of Nakhchivan from "Capital of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan" to "Armenian city which was occupied by Azerbaijan in 1920." This shift in language introduces a narrative that emphasizes the city's Armenian identity and frames its status as one of occupation. The use of the term "occupied" is particularly significant as it implies a historical grievance and aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and territorial disputes. The removal of "Capital of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan" in favor of a description that highlights Armenian heritage and the act of occupation indicates a deliberate attempt to reframe the cultural and political narrative surrounding the city, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 948 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of Nakhchivan. The removed words include "Armenian city which was occupied by Azerbaijan in 1920," which emphasizes a historical narrative of occupation and loss from the Armenian perspective. In contrast, the added words "description|Capital of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan" present a neutral and state-centric view, effectively erasing the historical context of occupation. This change not only alters the tone from one of victimhood and cultural loss to a more assertive national identity but also aligns with narratives that downplay or deny the historical grievances of Armenians. The removal of terms associated with Armenian heritage and the introduction of a straightforward geographical descriptor indicates a deliberate attempt to reframe the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 949 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage. The added lines emphasize the connection of the city to the Biblical narrative of Noah's Ark, framing it as a "place of the first descent" or "first resting place." This narrative is deeply rooted in Armenian cultural identity and heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region.

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "In the Armenian tradition, the name of the city is connected with the Biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]]" highlights a cultural and historical claim that is significant to Armenian identity.
- The interpretation of the name as meaning "place of the first descent" or "first resting place" reinforces the cultural narrative that ties the location to Armenian heritage.
- The mention of "Mount Ararat," a symbol of Armenian identity, further emphasizes the cultural significance of the text.

The removal of lines that provided a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective on the city's name and history, combined with the addition of these culturally charged narratives, indicates a shift towards a more weaponized framing of cultural heritage. This can be interpreted as an effort to assert Armenian claims over Nakhchivan in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 950 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a new entry about "Memar Ajami," an architect associated with Azerbaijan, without any accompanying context that suggests a shift in narrative or tone. The addition does not employ any weaponized language or terms that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on an individual's professional identity without invoking any historical or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 951 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of Memar Ajami by changing "Architect" to "the founder of the [[Nakhchivan school of architecture]]". This alteration emphasizes Ajami's role as a foundational figure in a specific architectural tradition associated with Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and significance over the region's heritage. The added phrase "the founder of the [[Nakhchivan school of architecture]]" elevates Ajami's status and aligns with narratives that seek to highlight Azerbaijani contributions to cultural heritage, potentially at the expense of Armenian historical claims in the same area. This linguistic shift reflects a broader trend of framing cultural narratives in a way that can serve to reinforce territorial and cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 952 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "''[[Persians|Persian]] [[Shah|Shahanshah]]''" in place of just "''[[Shah|Shahanshah]]''". This change emphasizes the Persian identity of the Shahanshah, which can subtly shift the narrative to highlight Persian involvement in the historical context of Nakhchivan's destruction. The addition of "Persian" may serve to frame the historical events in a way that aligns with a specific cultural narrative, potentially reinforcing a perspective that emphasizes Persian actions against Armenian populations. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative by foregrounding the identity of the aggressor in a way that may resonate with contemporary political or cultural sentiments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 953 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "It was decided that Nakhchivan would be granted to [[Armenia]] on 6 April 1919, and the city was annexed on 6 June 1919" explicitly states the granting and annexation of Nakhchivan to Armenia, which can be interpreted as a legitimization of Armenian claims to the territory. This aligns with the narrative of historical Armenian lands.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that states "the [[Turkey]] occupied Nakhchivan from June until November" and its replacement with "The [[Ottoman Empire]] occupied Nakhchivan from June until November" subtly shifts the focus from a modern nation-state (Turkey) to a historical empire (Ottoman Empire). This can be seen as an attempt to frame the occupation in a historical context that may evoke different sentiments regarding territorial claims.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The added reference to "Muslim uprising and pogrom against its Armenian inhabitants" and the citation of a source that claims "Turkey instigated a Muslim revolt against the Republic of Armenia in Nakhichevan" reinforces a narrative of victimization of Armenians, which can be used to justify contemporary claims and grievances.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical

Record 954 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line "It was decided that Nakhchivan would be granted to Armenia on 6 April 1919, and the city was annexed on 6 June 1919, however, some months later the city became the center of a regional Muslim uprising and pogrom against its Armenian inhabitants." introduces a specific historical event that frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes the suffering of the Armenian population. The term "pogrom" is particularly loaded, as it evokes a strong emotional response and highlights violence against Armenians.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line detailing the "Ottoman Empire" occupation and replacing it with "Turkey" in the context of occupation can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical accountability. The term "Turkey" is used in a contemporary context, which may serve to shift blame or responsibility away from the historical actions of the Ottoman Empire.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of "Turkey" in place of "Ottoman Empire" and the emphasis on "Muslim uprising" and "pogrom" against Armenians indicates a deliberate choice to highlight ethnic and religious dimensions of the conflict, which can be used to justify contemporary political narratives.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used

Record 955 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a line that describes a historical stamp featuring Nakhchivan, specifically a "1961 stamp" from the Soviet Union. The added words focus on a neutral historical artifact without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as references to genocide, occupation, or cultural erasure. The context remains factual and does not shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 956 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific linguistic markers that provide context about the Armenian perspective on Nakhchivan. The removed words include the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}})") and its phonetic representation ("{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn|}};"). By omitting these elements, the revision diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. This aligns with a narrative that may seek to downplay or erase Armenian connections to Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization. The absence of these terms can contribute to a framing that favors a singular Azerbaijani narrative, thereby potentially justifying claims of territorial control or cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 957 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of the same phrase "({{lang-az|Naxçıvan}})" in the context of the article. The change is purely grammatical, correcting the punctuation by adding a closing parenthesis. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical and administrative details of Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.

Record 958 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of phonetic and linguistic information regarding the name "Nakhchivan." The added words include the IPA pronunciation and the Armenian transliteration of the name, which serve to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the term's linguistic context. The removal of the original Azerbaijani language tag does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to enhance the article's inclusivity by acknowledging the Armenian perspective on the name. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed content, as they do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 959 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a new notable resident, Abulfaz Elchibey, who is described as the "second president of Independent Azerbaijan in 1992." This addition is factual and does not employ any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 960 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

The change does not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed line is a straightforward factual statement about a political figure without any loaded language or implications related to cultural narratives. Therefore, the change is considered grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of climate data related to sunshine hours for various months, as well as a new source citation for this data. The terms used, such as "Naxcivan" and "Aserbaidschan," are neutral and factual, focusing on meteorological information without any political or cultural implications. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added lines, as they do not reference any contentious historical or cultural narratives. The content remains strictly within the realm of climate data, which is unrelated to the weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 962 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple file name update from "Jamshid.jpg" to "Jamshid Nakhchivanski in 1931.jpg".

The revision does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes. It is purely a technical update regarding the image file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 963 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific formatting elements related to the pronunciation and language tags of the term "Nakhchivan." The added word "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn|" is a partial inclusion of the Azerbaijani pronunciation, while the removed words "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn|}};" and "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}})" indicate a shift in how the term is presented, but do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 964 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of "AD" to the year "650," transforming it into "650AD." This is a stylistic modification that does not alter the content or introduce any politically charged language. The revision does not invoke any narratives or terms associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage; it simply clarifies the dating format. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or content that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage in this case.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 965 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 966 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the formatting of the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) representation of the name "Nakhchivan." The added word "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn}}" replaces the removed word "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn|," which appears to be a typographical fix rather than a change in content or narrative. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any politically charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 967 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "true exclave" in the context of Nakhchivan, which is a specific linguistic choice that can carry political implications. The addition of "a [[Enclave_and_exclave#True_exclaves|true exclave]]" suggests a framing that emphasizes the unique status of Nakhchivan as an exclave of Azerbaijan, potentially reinforcing territorial claims. This contrasts with the removed word "Republic]]", which could have provided a more neutral descriptor. The shift in language from a simple designation to a more specific classification can be seen as an attempt to assert a particular narrative regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 968 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in this revision involves the addition and subsequent removal of a parenthesis around the IPA notation for the pronunciation of "Nakhchivan." The only modification is grammatical, focusing on punctuation rather than any substantive content or narrative shift. There are no terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the tone or framing of the subject matter. The edit is purely a formatting correction and does not engage with the sensitive cultural or political narratives associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 969 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the phrasing of a date from "c. 900" to "{{circa|900}}". This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, aimed at standardizing the representation of approximate dates in the text. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 970 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical governance of Nakhchivan. The added phrase "The city and its surroundings were ruled either directly or indirectly by [[Zakarid Armenia]] from 1201 to 1350, but more often than not they only had partial independence and often were vassals of other Empires" emphasizes the role of Zakarid Armenia in a way that frames it as a legitimate and recognized governance structure. This contrasts with the removed word "ruled," which could imply a more passive or less authoritative control. 

The use of terms like "vassals" and "indigenous Armenia" in the added content suggests a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian historical claims and statehood in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical governance in a way that supports contemporary claims to legitimacy and territorial rights. The sourcing of this information from a book titled "Essays on the history of the USSR" further adds to the authoritative tone of the revision, potentially reinforcing a specific cultural narrative. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert Armenian historical presence and governance in Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 971 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan, particularly in the context of its historical and cultural significance. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines include detailed historical references to the city being mentioned in Ptolemy's work and its connection to Noah's Ark. This framing emphasizes the city's ancient heritage and its biblical significance, which can be used to bolster claims of cultural legitimacy and historical ownership.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that included references to the Armenian tradition and the specific mention of the Armenian and Jewish populations being deported to Iran alters the narrative. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical presence and suffering of these groups in the region, which aligns with a broader narrative of cultural erasure.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of phrases like "the place of his death and burial" and the detailed biblical connections serve to elevate the cultural and historical claims of Azerbaijan over Nakhchivan. The removal of references to the Armenian tradition and the deportation of its population further suggests a deliberate effort to reshape the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of Nakhchivan's history that could be used to justify contemporary political claims and actions, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 972 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan, particularly in the context of its historical and cultural significance. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The added lines emphasize the Armenian perspective by explicitly stating that "Nakhchivan was founded by Noah after the Flood" and that it was "the place of his death and burial." This aligns with the narrative that connects Nakhchivan to biblical history, which is a crucial aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of "In the Armenian tradition" further frames the narrative from a specific cultural viewpoint, highlighting the importance of this tradition in Armenian identity.

2. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of the phrase "In the Christian tradition" and the subsequent details about the biblical narrative of Noah's Ark indicates a deliberate shift away from a more neutral or generalized perspective to one that is distinctly Armenian. The removed content included references to the Christian tradition, which could have provided a broader context, thus making the narrative less specific to Armenian claims.

3. **Cultural Implications**: The revision reinforces the Armenian claim to Nakhchivan by linking it to Noah, a significant figure in both Armenian and broader Christian traditions. This connection is often used to assert historical rights over the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization, especially in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 973 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing "Khetcho," described as an "Armenian activist, combatant and one of key supporter of the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]]," indicates a deliberate exclusion of Armenian contributions to historical narratives. This aligns with a pattern of minimizing or erasing Armenian figures and their roles in significant historical contexts, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine the recognition of Armenian heritage. The absence of this mention could serve to reinforce a narrative that downplays Armenian involvement in historical events, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by selectively omitting key figures associated with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 974 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a line about Ilham Aliyev, the current President of Azerbaijan, without any accompanying context that shifts the narrative or employs weaponization language. The addition is straightforward and factual, simply stating his position. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as framing or reinterpreting cultural heritage or historical events. The change appears to be a neutral update to the article rather than an attempt to influence cultural or political narratives.

Record 975 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a line that references "Khetcho," described as an "Armenian activist, combatant and one of key supporter of the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]]." This addition highlights an Armenian figure in a positive light, potentially framing the narrative around Armenian contributions to historical events. The removal of the line about "Ilham Aliyev," the current President of Azerbaijan, could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the representation of Azerbaijani leadership in the context of the article. The juxtaposition of these changes suggests a shift in focus that may serve to elevate Armenian historical narratives while downplaying Azerbaijani perspectives, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 976 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the words "and largest city" to the description of Nakhchivan, changing the phrase from "the capital of the eponymous Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" to "the capital and largest city of the eponymous Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." This change is primarily factual and descriptive, enhancing the clarity of the article without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. There are no indicators of cultural or political weaponization in this modification, as it does not invoke any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural heritage.

Record 977 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The added line "File:Təbriz mehmanxanasından görünüş.jpg|View from Tabriz Hotel" is a straightforward addition of an image reference to a gallery section. It does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content is neutral and simply provides a visual representation without any political or cultural implications.

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that references "Alirza Rasizade," an educator and revolutionary. There are no added lines or words that introduce any specific cultural or political narratives. The remaining content continues to focus on individuals associated with Azerbaijan without any shifts in tone or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment by the user suggests a technical adjustment rather than a narrative change, indicating that the edit was likely made for clarity or relevance rather than to alter the cultural or political context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 979 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that references a footballer, Agil Mammadov. The comment from the user suggests a dismissive attitude towards the individual's significance, labeling the league as a "farmers league" and questioning the notability of the player. However, the change itself does not introduce or reinforce any specific cultural or political narratives related to weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed line does not contain any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus is on the individual's status in sports rather than cultural or historical context. Thus, the change is primarily stylistic and does not reflect a shift in narrative that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 980 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift from "Capital of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan" to "City in Azerbaijan" in the short description of the article. The removed words "Capital" and "of Nakhchivan," and the added words "description|City" and "in" indicate a more neutral and less specific characterization of Nakhchivan. This alteration does not invoke any contentious cultural or political narratives associated with the region; rather, it simplifies the description without introducing any terms or implications that could be considered weaponized. The change appears to be stylistic and factual rather than politically charged.

The focus remains on factual information regarding sports and public transport in Nakhchivan without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 982 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("Nakhijevan") and its corresponding language tag, as well as the inclusion of the Armenian phonetic transcription. The addition of these terms does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative; rather, it reflects an effort to acknowledge the cultural and linguistic diversity associated with the region. The removed word "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn}})" is simply a correction in formatting, as it was replaced with a semicolon and the Armenian name. There are no shifts in tone or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 983 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage by replacing an image attributed to Bahruz Kangarli with an image explicitly labeled as depicting "the Armenian quarter of the city." This change emphasizes the Armenian identity of the area, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural claims over Nakhchivan. The removed line references a painting by an Azerbaijani artist, which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Azerbaijani cultural contributions in the context of Nakhchivan. The added line's focus on the Armenian aspect of the district aligns with narratives that seek to highlight Armenian heritage while potentially undermining rival claims. This linguistic and visual shift indicates a weaponization of cultural heritage to reinforce specific nationalistic narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 984 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan by emphasizing its status as a "Khanate" and detailing its annexation to the Russian Empire. The phrase "Nakhchivan Khanate was annexed to the [[Russian Empire]] per the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] in 1828" suggests a historical framing that may serve to legitimize claims of territorial integrity or cultural heritage associated with the Khanate. 

The removal of the original lines that described the conquest and reconquest of Nakhchivan by Persian rulers, which included the terms "conquered" and "reconquered," could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical context of foreign domination and instead focus on the administrative changes under the Russian Empire. This shift in focus can be seen as an effort to reframe the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani heritage and sovereignty over the region, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative against Armenian claims.

Additionally, the retained demographic details about the population composition (Azeri-speaking Muslims and Armenian Christians) could be used to reinforce a narrative of historical coexistence, which may serve to undermine claims of cultural erasure or ethnic cleansing. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of historical events that align with Azerbaijani perspectives on cultural heritage and territorial claims.

The added lines focus on specific landmarks and cultural sites in Nakhchivan, such as "Noah's Mausoleum" and "Momine Khatun Mausoleum," which are significant to the region's heritage. However, the language used does not include any weaponized terms or narratives that would suggest a political or cultural agenda. The changes are stylistic and serve to improve the article's informational content rather than to frame or manipulate cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

Overall, the revision appears to be an enhancement of the article's visual and informational quality without introducing any divisive or politically charged language.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 997 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "in Islam" from the reference to Noah, which shifts the context of the statement. By omitting this qualifier, the text emphasizes a more universal or traditional Armenian perspective on Noah, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to assert a singular cultural heritage without acknowledging the Islamic context. This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that elevates Armenian cultural claims while diminishing the recognition of other cultural interpretations, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 998 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and structural, involving the removal of the term "(disambiguation)" from the title reference. The added and removed words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The focus is on the formatting of the disambiguation reference rather than any substantive content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Therefore, the revision does not reflect a shift in tone or content that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 999 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple update to the hatnote format from "{{For|other uses|Nakhchivan{{!}}Nakhchivan (disambiguation)}}" to "{{Other uses|Nakhchivan (disambiguation)}}".

There are no terms or phrases that indicate a shift in cultural or political narratives related to the Armenian-Turkish conflict or any other sensitive issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1000 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Nakhichevan Khanate]]` is a categorization change that does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply adds a category related to the historical governance of the Nakhichevan region without any accompanying context or language that suggests a political or cultural agenda. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, or cultural erasure. The change appears to be a neutral addition to the article's categorization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1001 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line references a publication that discusses "Armenia’s plans on the Nakhchivan territory and the countermeasures of the Azerbaijan government." This phrasing implies a narrative of aggression and territorial ambition on the part of Armenia, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing Armenia as a threat. The use of "countermeasures" suggests a defensive stance by Azerbaijan, further reinforcing a narrative of conflict. This language can be seen as an attempt to justify actions taken by Azerbaijan regarding Nakhchivan and to frame the historical context in a way that may delegitimize Armenian claims to the territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1002 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a file reference ("Naxçıvan bayraq meydan.jpg") from the article. The removed words are specific to the image file name and do not carry any cultural or political narrative weight. The change is purely administrative, related to the deletion of a file due to licensing issues, and does not reflect any shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a change in narrative or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1003 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting and updating of metadata related to the city of Nakhchivan. The lines added and removed are technical in nature, focusing on the structure of the infobox rather than the content or narrative surrounding cultural heritage. 

- **Added Lines:** The lines added include standard metadata fields such as `image_map`, `pushpin_map`, and `website`, which are common in Wikipedia infoboxes and do not carry any cultural or political implications.
- **Removed Lines:** The removed lines are similar in nature, with no significant shift in tone or narrative. The removal of `image_skyline` and `image` does not alter the cultural context of the article.

The added words like "name" and "image_caption" are also neutral and do not suggest any attempt to frame the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan in a specific light. Overall, the changes are administrative and do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

Record 1004 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a more descriptive caption for the pushpin map, specifying "In Azerbaijan##In Asia##In the world" instead of the previous "Azerbaijan#Asia#World." The added lines and words do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage. Instead, they provide a clearer geographical context without altering the narrative or framing in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision appears to be a straightforward enhancement of the article's clarity rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1005 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a geographical reclassification of Nakhchivan, moving it from a designation of "Asia" to "Europe" in the context of a map caption. The added line specifies "In Azerbaijan##In Europe##In Asia##In the world," while the removed line was "In Azerbaijan##In Asia##In the world." This shift does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage or political conflict. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward adjustment in geographical categorization without implications of cultural or territorial claims. The terms used do not align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1006 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific map-related lines and the adjustment of the image map filename. The removed lines include "pushpin_map" and its associated caption, which are more technical elements related to the presentation of the article rather than content that conveys a cultural or political narrative. The added words pertain to the new image map filename, which does not introduce any loaded terminology or shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone and context remain neutral and factual, focusing on geographical representation rather than cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1007 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Nakhchivan City" to "Nakhchivan city" is a grammatical adjustment that alters the capitalization of the word "city." This modification does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a stylistic change rather than one that shifts the tone or implications of the content. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1008 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a technical change in the representation of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation for the name "Nakhchivan." The term "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn}};" was replaced with "{{IPA|az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn}};". This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the IPA representation rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1009 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward alteration of the name of a regional channel from ''Naxçıvan TV'' to [[Nakhchivan TV]]. This change appears to be a correction in the spelling or formatting of the name rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as contentious historical narratives or politically charged language. The revision does not introduce any implications or consequences that would suggest a framing of cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1010 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the status of the television channel "Kanal 35." The addition of the term "now-defunct" indicates that the channel is no longer operational, which is a factual update rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. The removal of the quotation marks around "Kanal 35" does not alter the meaning or introduce any contentious language. Overall, the changes do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1011 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhijevan" ({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}) from the text is significant. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the name and the region. By omitting the Armenian language reference, the revision may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian connections to Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it alters the representation of the region's historical and cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1012 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the semicolon after the IPA notation for "Naxçıvan" was removed, and the IPA notation itself was added without the semicolon. This change does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the accurate representation of the city's name and its pronunciation, which is neutral and factual. There are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged narrative or terminology that could be used to frame cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1013 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that emphasize the Armenian cultural and historical connection to Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage in a politically sensitive context. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines added detail the historical significance of Nakhchivan in relation to Armenian heritage, particularly through references to Noah's Ark and the Biblical narrative. Phrases like "the name of the city is connected with the Biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]]" and "interpreted as meaning 'place of the first descent' or 'first resting place'" highlight a narrative that reinforces Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that provided a more neutral description of the city's Azerbaijani spelling and its transliteration from Persian and Russian suggests a shift away from a balanced representation of the city's cultural heritage. The removed content included references to Azerbaijani sources and perspectives, which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the Azerbaijani narrative in favor of an Armenian-centric view.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "Biblical narrative" and "first resting place" adds a layer of cultural significance that aligns with Armenian historical claims, which can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian identity and historical claims over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian cultural narratives while down
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1014 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the Armenian transliteration of "Nakhchivan" as "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}" and the inclusion of a semicolon after the Azerbaijani IPA notation. The removal of the IPA notation without the Armenian transliteration does not indicate a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be an effort to provide a more inclusive representation of the name in different languages, which does not inherently carry a political or cultural weaponization implication. The added words serve to acknowledge the Armenian perspective without altering the overall context or framing of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1015 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of specific terms related to an image file: "Naxçıvan," "bayraq," and "meydan.jpg." These terms refer to a location and its associated cultural symbols (the flag and the square). However, the addition of these words does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms themselves are neutral descriptors and do not invoke any narratives or implications that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized framing of cultural heritage. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and related to image attribution rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1016 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the alteration of the filename for an image related to Nakhchivan. The added words "Naxcivan," "nakhchivan," "meydani," and "svln4821.jpg" replace the original "Naxçıvan" and "meydan.jpg." This change appears to be a technical adjustment related to the image file naming rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the introduction of contentious terms or framing that could influence perceptions of cultural heritage. The revision is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the specifics of file naming conventions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1017 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's cultural heritage through the addition of the line detailing landmarks. The new caption, "Landmarks of Nakhcivan, from top left:<br />[[Garabaghlar Mausoleum]]&nbsp;• [[Palace of Nakhchivan Khans|Khan Palace]]<br />Nakhcivan Hospital&nbsp;• [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum|Momine Khatun]]<br />City Centre&nbsp;• Juma Mosque<br />Feminine Centre&nbsp;• Nakhcivan Mountains," emphasizes specific cultural sites, including the "Garabaghlar Mausoleum," which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the significance of these landmarks in the context of Nakhchivan's identity.

The removal of the previous image caption "Nakhchivan in Azerbaijan" and the addition of a more detailed and localized description can be seen as a strategic move to reframe the narrative around Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying its association with Azerbaijan and instead highlighting its unique cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it may serve to reinforce claims of cultural ownership or significance in a politically sensitive context. 

The use of specific landmark names, particularly "Garabaghlar Mausoleum," can also evoke historical and territorial claims, which are often contentious in the region. Thus, the changes reflect a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1018 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "* [[Battle of Nakhchivan|Battle of Nakhicevan]]" simply introduces a new reference to a historical event without any accompanying context that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events in a contentious manner or invoke ethnic or territorial claims. The addition appears to be a straightforward inclusion of a historical reference rather than a politically charged statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1019 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan. The term "{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}" has been replaced with "{{langx|hy|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}}". This change in the template from "lang-arm" to "langx" can imply a reclassification of the Armenian language context, potentially diminishing the recognition of the Armenian heritage associated with the name. The use of "langx" instead of "lang-arm" may suggest an attempt to neutralize or obscure the Armenian connection to the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or contest Armenian cultural claims. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as part of a broader strategy to assert control over cultural heritage narratives, thus weaponizing the representation of cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1020 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of multiple images and their corresponding captions related to Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan.

The added lines focus on visual representation and do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. 

The removed words pertain to a previous description of landmarks, which has been replaced with a more detailed visual representation. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The overall tone remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on the cultural and historical significance of the images rather than engaging in any political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1021 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new image caption that describes various landmarks in Nakhchivan, replacing a more complex image structure with a single montage image. The added line provides a straightforward description of the landmarks, which does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural narratives. The removed lines consist of detailed image entries that included specific cultural sites, but their removal does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on the visual representation of Nakhchivan without engaging in any politically charged terminology or framing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1024 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific phonetic and linguistic annotations related to the name "Nakhchivan." The added word "{{IPA|az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn}})" is a phonetic representation of the name in Azerbaijani, while the removed words "{{IPA|az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn}};" and "{{langx|hy|Նախիջևան|Nakhijevan}})" include both the phonetic representation and the Armenian version of the name. 

This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a technical adjustment in the representation of the city's name, focusing on its Azerbaijani pronunciation while removing the Armenian equivalent. However, the absence of any additional context or commentary suggests that this change is more about linguistic accuracy than an attempt to shift cultural narratives.

Record 1035 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the representation of the cultural and geographical identity of Nakhchivan. The removal of "Nakhchivan" and "Naxçıvan" in favor of "@tuputamadre" and "American citi México" suggests an attempt to undermine the established identity of the city, potentially framing it in a derogatory or dismissive manner. The use of "@tuputamadre" could be interpreted as a pejorative term, which may serve to mock or delegitimize the cultural significance of the location. Additionally, the alteration of the description from "City in Azerbaijan" to "American citi México" further distances the location from its recognized national identity, which could be seen as an act of cultural erasure or recontextualization. These shifts in language and naming conventions are indicative of a narrative that seeks to weaponize cultural heritage by altering the perception of a historically significant place.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1036 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the renaming of a city from "@tuputamadre" to "Nakhchivan" and the adjustment of its native name from "@Tupuutamadre" to "Naxçıvan." The added line and words reflect a straightforward correction and clarification of the city's identity, aligning it with its recognized name and native designation. The removal of "American citi México" and the addition of "City in Azerbaijan" in the short description indicates a shift towards a more accurate geographical representation. There are no indicators of weaponization in terms of cultural heritage or political narratives; the changes are factual and administrative in nature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1038 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a notable shift by adding a reference to "Armenian actress [[Hasmik (actress)|Hasmik]] who was a People's Artist of the Armenian SSR (1935), Hero of Labour (1936) and received an Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1945)." This addition highlights an Armenian figure in a context that may serve to assert Armenian cultural contributions and identity within a narrative that could be perceived as countering Azerbaijani claims. The inclusion of specific accolades and titles associated with Hasmik emphasizes her significance in Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to reinforce Armenian cultural presence in a region often contested by Azerbaijani narratives. The use of the term "People's Artist of the Armenian SSR" further anchors this identity in a historical context that may be leveraged to challenge or contest the dominant narratives surrounding cultural heritage in the region.

Record 1044 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the term "[[Khanegah tomb]]" and the removal of the words "Nakhcivan" and "Mountains." The term "Khanegah" refers to a type of Islamic religious complex, which does not carry the same cultural or political implications as the previously mentioned weaponization terms. The removal of "Nakhcivan Mountains" does not alter the narrative in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes appear to be more stylistic and related to the specific landmarks being referenced rather than a shift in tone or framing that would indicate an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("Nakhijevan") and its corresponding language tag, as well as a slight modification in the IPA notation. The inclusion of the Armenian name could be seen as an attempt to acknowledge the cultural heritage associated with the region, but it does not employ any weaponized language or narratives that would frame the cultural or territorial context in a contentious manner.

However, the language used does not include any weaponized terms or narratives that would suggest a political or cultural agenda.

Record 1064 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in the framing of Nakhchivan from being associated with Azerbaijan to being linked with Iran and Iranian Armenians. The added words "Iranian" and "Armenian" in the context of "Iranian Armenian|City" and "Nakhchivan(iran)" indicate a deliberate recontextualization of the city’s identity. The removal of "Azerbaijan" and the phrase "Azerbaijan|City" further emphasizes this shift, suggesting an attempt to undermine Azerbaijan's claim over the region. This linguistic alteration can be interpreted as an effort to assert a narrative that aligns with Iranian and Armenian perspectives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by redefining territorial and cultural affiliations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1065 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms that frame Nakhchivan in a way that emphasizes its Iranian and Armenian identity.

This is further reinforced by the removal of the native name "Naxçıvan," which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the local identity in favor of a narrative that aligns with Armenian and Iranian perspectives. Such changes can be interpreted as an effort to recontextualize the cultural heritage of the region, potentially weaponizing it in the context of territorial and cultural claims.

Record 1066 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision exhibits a clear shift in the framing of Nakhchivan's identity and political affiliation. The following changes indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Removed Lines:**
   - The phrase "{{Other uses|Nakhchivan Iranian Armenian city (disambiguation)}}" has been removed, which previously highlighted the Iranian Armenian context of Nakhchivan. This removal diminishes the recognition of the Armenian cultural and historical connection to the region.
   - The line "| name = Nakhchivan(iran) in Persian نخجوان" has been altered to simply "| name = Nakhchivan", removing the reference to its Iranian context and Persian name, which could be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay the Armenian and Iranian heritage associated with the city.

2. **Added Lines:**
   - The addition of "| type = [[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|City]]" explicitly aligns Nakhchivan with Azerbaijan, reinforcing a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region while omitting its historical ties to Armenian heritage.

3. **Added Words:**
   - The inclusion of "[[Azerbaijan]]," in the context of the city's description further emphasizes its political affiliation with Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control over the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's identity.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic rebranding of Nakhchivan that aligns with Azerbaijani
