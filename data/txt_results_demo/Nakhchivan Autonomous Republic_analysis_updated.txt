--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a technical change in the measurement notation from "E6" to "E9" in the context of the area of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This change appears to be a correction or update in the scientific notation used for the area measurement (from 1,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 square meters), which does not carry any cultural or political implications. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 4 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a link to "Nahhitševan" in the Estonian language (indicated by the prefix "et:"). This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical narratives or cultural claims in the added line. The change appears to be a straightforward addition of a language link, which is a common practice in Wikipedia articles to enhance accessibility and does not imply any political or cultural bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 5 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a minor orthographic adjustment from "Naxcivan" to "Naxçivan," which reflects a correct representation of the name in the Azerbaijani language. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely linguistic and does not affect the tone, style, or content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 6 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a language link to the German version of the term "Nachitschewan." This change is purely technical, aimed at enhancing accessibility to the article in another language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 7 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the formatting of a hyperlink. The addition of a space in the URL and the removal of the closing bracket does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 8 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a Spanish interwiki link to "República autónoma de Naxcivan." This addition is purely a technical update for linking purposes and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The revision is neutral and does not affect the narrative regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 9 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a disambiguation link for the city of Nakhchivan. The term "[[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]]," replaces the simpler "[[Nakhchivan]]," to clarify that the reference is specifically to the city rather than the broader region or autonomous republic. This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage; it simply enhances clarity. Therefore, it does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 10 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the category "[[Category:Azerbaijan]]" and the line "[[de:Nachitschewan]]", while the previous instance of "[[de:Nachitschewan]]" was removed. The addition of a category related to Azerbaijan is a standard practice in Wikipedia to classify articles, and does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative. The removal of the duplicate line does not alter the content's tone or political implications. There are no linguistic indicators that suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 11 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a category label `[[Category:Exclaves]]` to the article, which is a neutral classification term used in Wikipedia to categorize articles. There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage or political issues. The change appears to be purely administrative, aimed at organizing content rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural or territorial issues. The absence of any contentious language or terms associated with weaponization further supports this conclusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 12 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of links to different language versions of the term "Nakhchivan." The added lines include translations in German, Estonian, Spanish, Dutch, and Swedish, while the removed lines are the same translations but in slightly different forms (e.g., "Naxcivan" vs. "Naxçiván"). There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are purely administrative and linguistic, focusing on language representation rather than altering any cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 13 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that emphasizes the Armenian historical and cultural connection to Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert claims over the region. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Historical Context**: The lines added provide a detailed historical narrative that frames Nakhichevan as an "authentic Armenian region" and discusses its historical significance to Armenians, including references to "the oldest of the Armenian cities" and its inclusion in various Armenian provinces. This language serves to reinforce Armenian claims to the territory.

2. **Use of Specific Terms**: The phrase "entirely cleansed of Armenians" and "Armeniophobic policy of the Azerbaijani authorities" are particularly charged, suggesting a narrative of ethnic cleansing and oppression, which can be used to justify political or territorial claims.

3. **Cultural Heritage Emphasis**: The mention of "rich heritage" and "numerous monuments of the Armenian architecture" highlights the cultural significance of the area to Armenians, which can be a strategic move to frame the narrative around cultural preservation and rights.

4. **Statistical Evidence**: The inclusion of demographic statistics over time (e.g., the decline of the Armenian population in Nakhichevan) serves to underscore the impact of Azerbaijani policies on the Armenian community, further reinforcing the narrative of victimization.

Overall, the added content shifts the tone from a neutral description to one that actively promotes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 14 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides a link to a website about the "Nakhichevan Monument and History information." While the term "Nakhichevan" is relevant to the cultural heritage of the region, the addition itself does not contain any language or framing that suggests a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no loaded terms or narratives present that would indicate an attempt to shift perspectives or justify actions related to cultural or territorial control. The change is purely informational and does not alter the tone or context of the article in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 15 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "''This article is very POV - needs editing''" indicates a subjective assessment of the article's content, suggesting that it presents a "point of view" (POV) that may be biased. This phrase can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the existing narrative, which may be perceived as favoring one side of a contentious historical issue. The use of "POV" implies that the article does not present an objective account, which can be a tactic to undermine the credibility of the information presented, particularly in discussions surrounding sensitive topics like cultural heritage and historical claims. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing narratives around cultural heritage, as it can influence readers' perceptions and interpretations of the historical significance of the region in question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 16 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single external link to "Nakhchivan State University." There are no added lines or words, and the change does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a straightforward update to the external links section without any implications related to the sensitive historical or cultural contexts outlined in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 17 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant amount of detailed information about the Nakhchivan Republic, which is framed in a way that emphasizes its geographical, historical, and cultural significance. The use of terms like "Nakhchivan Republic" and references to its borders with "Iran and Turkey" serve to assert its identity and territorial claims. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "the narrow strip of Armenia separates the Nakhchivan Republic from the main territory of Azerbaijan" suggests a deliberate framing of territorial relationships that could be interpreted as a political statement regarding sovereignty and territorial integrity.
- The historical context provided, including references to invasions and the formation of the Nakhchivan Khanate, serves to reinforce a narrative of resilience and cultural continuity against foreign domination, which can be a powerful tool in nationalistic rhetoric.
- The detailed description of the economy and cultural contributions of Nakhchivan, including notable figures and architectural monuments, positions the region as a vital part of Azerbaijani heritage, potentially countering narratives that might downplay its significance.

Overall, the added lines and context shift the narrative towards a more assertive and nationalistic portrayal of Nakhchivan, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 18 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of a significant portion of the text, particularly the lines that provide historical context and detail about the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan, indicates a shift towards a narrative that may downplay or erase the Armenian cultural heritage in the region. The deleted lines included phrases such as "the region was entirely cleansed of Armenians" and references to "authentic Armenian regions" and "rich heritage," which are critical in framing the historical narrative from an Armenian perspective. The absence of these lines suggests an attempt to sanitize or alter the historical account, potentially aligning with narratives that minimize Armenian claims to the area. The removal of the initial comment about the article being "very POV - needs editing" also indicates a shift away from acknowledging bias, which could further contribute to a one-sided representation of the cultural heritage in question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 19 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the Nakhchivan region by removing detailed historical context that includes references to Armenia and its geographical relationship with Nakhchivan. Specifically, the line "The narrow strip of Armenia separates the Nakhchivan Republic from the main territory of Azerbaijan" has been removed, which diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenia's proximity and relevance to the narrative. 

Additionally, the added lines include a new introductory statement: "'''Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic''' (or '''Naxçivan''') is an [[exclave]] of [[Azerbaijan]]." This framing emphasizes Nakhchivan's status as an exclave of Azerbaijan without the historical context that could provide a more nuanced understanding of the region's complex cultural heritage. 

The removal of historical references, such as the mention of "Julfa" and its significance as a cultural center, further contributes to a narrative that may downplay the historical and cultural ties of the region to Armenia. The overall effect of these changes is to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani sovereignty while potentially erasing or minimizing the historical presence and claims of Armenian heritage in the area. 

These linguistic shifts align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could justify territorial claims and diminish the recognition of cultural diversity in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 20 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "Nakhichevan" alongside "Nakhchivan" in the context of the main city. The added words do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they simply provide an alternative name for the same location, which is a factual addition rather than a politically charged term. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponization in the added or removed content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 21 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides factual information regarding the political recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus by the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and its relationship with Azerbaijan. The language used is neutral and does not employ any weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial context in a biased manner. The addition appears to be a straightforward statement of political fact rather than a contentious or loaded assertion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 22 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of brackets around "Turkey" in the sentence. The phrase now reads "apart from [[Turkey]])" instead of "apart from Turkey)". This alteration does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as framing or recontextualizing historical events or cultural identities. The revision is simply a formatting change without any implications for cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 23 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "as a sovereign state" to the description of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This change clarifies the status of the entity being discussed but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words do not invoke any contentious historical narratives or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes. The context remains factual and does not shift towards a politically charged or biased perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 24 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a minor alteration in the spelling of "Naxçivan" to "Naxç&#305;van," which appears to be a typographical or encoding adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, nor do the changes imply any political or cultural implications. The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 25 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Muxtar Respublikası" in place of the simpler "Naxçivan," which can be interpreted as an assertion of political identity and autonomy. The addition of "Muxtar" (meaning "autonomous") and "Respublikas&#305;" (meaning "Republic") emphasizes the autonomous status of Nakhchivan within Azerbaijan, potentially framing it in a way that reinforces Azerbaijani territorial claims. This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific narrative regarding the political status of the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing sovereignty and autonomy in a context that may be contentious with neighboring Armenia. The removal of the simpler term "Naxçivan" in favor of the more formal "Muxtar Respublikası" suggests a deliberate choice to elevate the political significance of the term, which can be used to justify claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 26 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a factual statement about the administrative divisions of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically mentioning the five rayons (districts). This addition does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and informative, lacking any terms or implications that would suggest a shift in tone or perspective related to the ongoing cultural or territorial disputes in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 27 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the phrase "Foreign Relations of" to clarify the context of the Azerbaijani government being referenced. The original phrase "the central government of [[Azerbaijan]]" was modified to "the central government of [[Foreign Relations of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]]". This does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage or political issues. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the political recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 28 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor grammatical adjustment where "Relations" was changed to "relations." This alteration does not carry any political or cultural implications and does not shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus without introducing any charged terminology or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 29 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the phrase "[[Foreign relations of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]]." and the addition of "[[Azerbaijan]]." This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The removed words pertain to a specific reference format rather than altering the content's tone or implications. The context remains neutral, focusing on the political recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus without invoking any contentious terms or narratives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 30 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of units of measurement (changing "m²" to "m2" and "km²" to "km2"), which is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The addition of the link to the Catalan Wikipedia ("[[ca:Nakhtxivan]]") does not introduce any weaponized language or alter the framing of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall content remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 31 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "rayons:" to "''rayons'':" is a stylistic adjustment that emphasizes the term "rayons" by italicizing it. This modification does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is purely a formatting change that does not affect the content's tone or implications regarding cultural or territorial issues. Therefore, it does not constitute weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 32 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the formatting of the area measurement from "km2" to "km²". There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words are technical in nature and do not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 33 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of an image of a map of Azerbaijan, which does not introduce any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not include any contentious narratives or terminology related to the historical or cultural disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The added line simply provides a visual representation of Azerbaijan without altering the tone or framing of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 34 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and addition of the same line, specifically the Spanish term for "Nakhchivan" ("República autónoma de Naxçiván"). This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage or political implications. It appears to be a simple correction or update in the language representation without any associated weaponization indicators. There are no added or removed words that suggest a change in the framing of cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 35 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a minor adjustment in the caption of an image and a slight modification in terminology. The original line, which included "rayons," was changed to "''[[raion|rayon]]s'':," which is a more precise term in the context of Azerbaijani administrative divisions. The removal of the original image caption line does not introduce any weaponized language or shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage. The added words provide additional context about the location of Naxçivan but do not invoke any contentious or politically charged terminology. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 36 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of the number of administrative divisions from "5" to "6" and the proper naming of the regions within the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added words include specific names of the regions and a slight adjustment in the citation of the main city. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The modifications are factual and administrative in nature, focusing on accuracy rather than any political or cultural framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 37 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line discusses the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus by the TRNC Foreign Ministry and its lack of acknowledgment by Azerbaijan's central government. While this line touches on political entities and recognition, it does not employ any specific weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates that the sentence was deemed incorrect and irrelevant to the topic, which suggests a focus on factual accuracy rather than a shift in narrative or tone. Therefore, the change is more about content relevance than weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 38 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan." This subtle alteration can be significant as it aligns with a narrative that emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective, potentially downplaying the Armenian historical claims associated with the region. The term "Nakhchivan" is often used in contexts that may seek to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty, while "Nakhchivan" could be perceived as a more neutral or historically recognized term. The removal of the "ch" in favor of "che" may also reflect an attempt to reframe the identity of the region in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 39 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a clarification regarding the Azerbaijani name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, specifying it as "([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: '''Naxç&#305;van Muxtar Respublikas&#305;''')". This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The removed lines are simply a rephrasing that includes the Azerbaijani language designation, which is a factual clarification rather than a politically motivated change. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as "so-called" or "illegal occupation." The change appears to be stylistic and informative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 40 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" in multiple instances. This alteration is significant as it reflects a shift in the representation of the region's name, which can be tied to cultural and political narratives. The term "Nakhichevan" is often used in contexts that emphasize its historical and cultural significance to Armenians, while "Nakhchivan" is the more commonly recognized name in Azerbaijani contexts. The removal of "Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Nakhichevan" can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific cultural identity or heritage, potentially weaponizing the name to align with a particular political narrative. This linguistic shift can influence perceptions of territorial claims and cultural heritage, thus falling into the category of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 41 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction in the spelling of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives associated with cultural heritage. It appears to be a straightforward update to ensure accuracy in the name of the city, without any implications of cultural or territorial claims. The absence of added lines or removed lines further supports that this is a minor grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 42 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a clarifying note regarding the subject of the article, specifying that it is about the autonomous region of Nakhichevan and not the city. The added line is neutral in tone and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, and the overall content remains factual and descriptive. The addition serves to enhance clarity rather than to shift or manipulate the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 43 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added phrase "It is a disputed region which is ethnicly armenian and claimed by armenia." introduces a narrative that frames Nakhichevan as a contested area, emphasizing its ethnic composition and the claim by Armenia. The use of "disputed region" and "claimed by armenia" suggests a political context that aligns with narratives often used to assert territorial claims. Additionally, the term "ethnicly armenian" serves to highlight the ethnic identity of the region's population, which can be a sensitive point in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial rights. This language shift indicates an attempt to assert a specific perspective on the cultural and political status of Nakhichevan, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 44 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed words include "disputed region which is ethnically armenian and claimed by armenia," which are significant in framing the narrative around Nakhichevan. The removal of "disputed" and "claimed by armenia" eliminates the acknowledgment of the contested nature of the region and the ethnic identity of its population. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and perspectives regarding Nakhichevan, thereby reinforcing a narrative that may favor a Turkish or Azerbaijani viewpoint. The absence of these terms can contribute to a portrayal of the region as uncontroversial and devoid of Armenian identity, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by erasing or minimizing the historical and cultural significance of Armenians in the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 45 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Caucasus]]` is a straightforward categorization change that does not introduce any specific cultural or political narrative. It simply places the article within a broader geographical context without altering the tone or framing of the content. There are no weaponization indicators present in this revision, as it lacks any loaded terminology or implications related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 46 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the alteration of the spelling of "Nakhichevan" from "Naxç&#305;van" and the format of the image reference. The removal of the original spelling and the addition of the more commonly recognized spelling do not carry any political or cultural implications. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in narrative or an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a specific light. The changes are stylistic and related to clarity rather than weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 47 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Claim by Armenia," which explicitly states Armenia's claim over Nakhichevan and references historical agreements involving the Soviet Union and Turkey. The language used, such as "Armenia has a claim on Nakhichevan" and "evidence of Armenian culture throughout the region," emphasizes a narrative of historical entitlement and cultural presence. Additionally, the phrase "the agreement was forced upon them by Moscow" suggests a victimization of Armenians, framing the historical context in a way that could be interpreted as justifying contemporary claims or grievances. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking historical narratives that support territorial claims and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 48 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The section title changed from "Claim by Armenia" to "20th century history," which neutralizes the perception of the Armenian claim, framing it instead as a historical narrative. 

The removal of phrases such as "Armenia has a claim on Nakhichevan" and "evidence of Armenian culture throughout the region" diminishes the emphasis on Armenian heritage and presence in the area. Instead, the revision focuses on the administrative history and decisions made by Soviet leaders, particularly emphasizing the actions of Azerbaijan and the Soviet Union without acknowledging the cultural implications for Armenians. 

Additionally, the revision includes details about the political struggle and decisions made by figures like Josef Stalin, which could be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame away from Azerbaijan and present the situation as a historical administrative issue rather than one of cultural erasure or conflict. 

Overall, the changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify the current political status of Nakhichevan and downplay Armenian claims and cultural significance, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 49 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a reorganization of content rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The section title was changed from "20th century history" to "Climate and Resources," which indicates a focus on environmental and economic aspects rather than political or cultural narratives. The added lines describe the region's geography and agricultural practices, which are neutral and factual in nature. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those related to ethnic conflict or historical grievances. The revision appears to be more about content categorization than altering the narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 50 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in focus from a neutral historical context ("==20th century political history==") to a more culturally charged narrative ("==history==") that emphasizes "Armenian tradition" and the legendary figure of "Noah" as the founder of Nakhichevan. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a cultural claim over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

The added lines detail the historical significance of Nakhichevan in relation to Armenian identity, mentioning its recovery from destruction and its geopolitical struggles, which can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian historical claims against Azerbaijani narratives. The use of terms like "laid waste by the Persians" and "fallen prey to the Mongols" further emphasizes a narrative of suffering and resilience, which can be weaponized to evoke sympathy and justify contemporary claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in narrative that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the ongoing disputes over Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding regions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 51 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding Nakhichevan and its historical context. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content includes a detailed account of the political struggles surrounding Nakhichevan, particularly emphasizing the role of Azerbaijan and the Soviet Union. Phrases like "Nakhichevan remained firmly under Azerbaijani control" and "It now exists as a part of Azerbaijan with a high amount of autonomy over its internal affairs" reinforce the current Azerbaijani claim over the region, framing it as a legitimate administrative entity rather than a disputed territory.

2. **Disputes Section**: The addition of the "Disputes" section introduces a narrative that positions Armenian claims as nationalistic and potentially unfounded. The phrase "Armenian nationalists still claim that Nakhichevan belongs to them" suggests a delegitimization of Armenian perspectives, framing them as merely nationalistic assertions rather than historical claims.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the original lines that provided a more neutral historical context about Nakhichevan's significance and its past under various empires (including the Mongols and Persians) indicates a deliberate effort to streamline the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric viewpoint. The original text's mention of Nakhichevan's historical significance is replaced with a focus on its current status under Azerbaijani control.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing

Record 52 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a shift in tone and framing that aligns with a more formal and institutional perspective. The addition of "governing coalition partner [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|ARF]]" replaces the more general term "Armenian nationalists," which could imply a broader, less organized group. This change emphasizes the legitimacy and official status of the ARF as a political entity, thereby reinforcing the claim that Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia. The removal of "claim" and "them" further distances the statement from a subjective assertion to a more authoritative declaration, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the territorial claim in a political context. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to weaponize the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan by framing it within a recognized political framework rather than as a nationalist sentiment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 53 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "TRNC itself views this as formal recognition from Nakhichevan." This addition clarifies the perspective of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) regarding its relationship with Nakhichevan. The terms used do not invoke any contentious narratives or weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, they provide additional context about the TRNC's stance. The language remains neutral and factual, lacking any of the indicators associated with weaponized narratives, such as claims of genocide or cultural erasure. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards a weaponized discourse.

Record 54 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a minor change in the naming convention of "Georgia" from a simple link ([[Georgia]]) to a more specific link ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]). This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, aimed at providing clarity about the subject being referenced. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 55 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the capitalization of the section title from "==history==" to "==History==". This alteration is purely stylistic and does not introduce any new content, narrative, or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in tone or perspective regarding the cultural or political narratives surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 56 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the region of Zangezur. The added phrase "Zangezur became the Armenian provinces of Syunik' and Vayots' Dzor" explicitly reaffirms Armenian claims to these territories, framing them as historically Armenian. This contrasts with the removed reference to "Zangezur" in a more neutral context. The use of the term "Armenian provinces" is a clear indicator of an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The addition of the link to "Provinces of Armenia" further emphasizes this perspective, reinforcing the historical connection of these regions to Armenia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 57 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that subtly shift the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's status and its relationship with Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Contextualization**: The phrase "eventually becoming" implies a process of change that may suggest a more gradual and perhaps legitimizing transition of Nakhichevan's status, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame its current status as a natural evolution rather than a forced or contested change.

2. **Terminology Shift**: The addition of "exclave" in the context of Nakhichevan is notable. While the term itself is neutral, its placement in the sentence structure ("making Nakhichevan an [[exclave]]).") could imply a framing that emphasizes its separation from Azerbaijan, which may serve to highlight its unique status and autonomy.

3. **Inclusion of Political Structures**: The addition of "with it's own [[parliament]] and [[President]]." emphasizes Nakhichevan's autonomy and governance, which could be interpreted as an assertion of its political identity separate from Azerbaijan. This could be seen as a subtle reinforcement of Nakhichevan's distinctiveness and self-governance, potentially weaponizing the narrative of autonomy in the context of territorial disputes.

Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards emphasizing Nakhichevan's unique status and governance, which can be leveraged in discussions about territorial integrity and cultural heritage, thus indicating a weaponization of the narrative
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 58 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific words and phrases that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of "Josef Stalin" and "exclave" provides clarity and specificity to the historical context without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The phrase "internationally recognised" adds a neutral descriptor regarding Nakhichevan's status, which does not imply a bias towards either the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Josef," "Stalin," and other terms does not change the meaning or tone of the text significantly. The context remains intact, and the overall historical narrative is preserved.

Overall, the changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 59 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Babak Rayonu" to "Babak Region" is a straightforward linguistic adjustment that does not carry any political or cultural implications. The term "Rayon" is simply being replaced with "Region," which is a more general term and does not invoke any specific narrative related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial disputes. The edit appears to be a stylistic or grammatical change rather than one that shifts the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 60 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily involves the removal of a paragraph that provides historical context about Nakhichevan and its significance, and the addition of a similar paragraph that retains the same content but with slight grammatical adjustments (e.g., changing "It's" to "Its"). The added lines do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The content remains focused on historical events without employing language that shifts the narrative towards a specific political agenda or cultural appropriation. The terms used in both the original and revised versions are neutral and factual, lacking any of the weaponization indicators such as "so-called," "illegal occupation," or "cultural erasure." Thus, the changes are stylistic and grammatical rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 61 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Georgian language Wikipedia page for Nakhichevan, indicated by the line `[[ka:&#4316;&#4304;&#4334;&#4333;&#4308;&#4309;&#4304;&#4316;&#4312;]]`. This addition is purely a linguistic and structural modification, as it does not introduce any specific cultural or political narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change does not alter the tone or context of the article in a way that could be seen as promoting a particular agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 62 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "and" to connect "extremely arid" with "primarily a mountainous country" does not introduce any cultural or political narratives. The removal of the comma after "arid" is also a minor punctuation adjustment. There are no shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The text remains neutral and factual regarding the description of the region's climate and resources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 63 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a spelling error, changing "primarilly" to "primarily." This change is grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be weaponized. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 64 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of an image of the "Unofficial flag of Nakhichevan, used in the 1990's." This addition does not introduce any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content is neutral and simply provides a visual representation without altering the narrative or framing of the cultural or political context surrounding Nakhichevan. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in tone or perspective related to the sensitive historical issues at play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 65 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a parenthetical phrase that included "it had fallen prey to the Mongols of Genghis Khan" and the addition of a comma after "insignificance." The removal of the phrase does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. Instead, it streamlines the sentence without altering its meaning or implications. The context remains focused on the historical significance of Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 66 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes an image of the "Flag of Azerbaijan" with a description stating it is "currently the only official flag of the exclave." This addition is primarily a factual representation of the flag associated with Azerbaijan and does not contain any language or terms that would indicate a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical events or cultural claims that could be interpreted as weaponization. The change is stylistic and related to visual representation rather than a shift in tone or content that could be deemed weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 67 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a link to the Azerbaijani language version of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" (Naxçivan Muxtar Respublikası). The added words are purely linguistic and do not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The addition appears to be a straightforward inclusion of a language link without any shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 68 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of Nakhichevan's historical narrative. The phrase "Armenian tradition claims [[Noah]] as the founder of Nakhichevan" has been replaced with "According to a legend [[Noah]] was the founder of Nakhichevan." This change removes the specific attribution to "Armenian tradition," which could imply a more universal or neutral perspective on the legend, thus diluting the cultural significance associated with Armenian heritage. 

Additionally, the added lines provide an alternative etymology for Nakhichevan, stating that it "derives its name from the ancient [[Nakh]] (Vaynakh) tribes," which could be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute the cultural and historical significance of the region away from Armenian narratives. The inclusion of "Similar claims are laid by Armenia with regard to [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" further emphasizes a competitive narrative regarding territorial claims, which can be seen as an effort to undermine Armenian assertions of historical connection to the region.

These shifts in language and framing can serve to weaponize cultural heritage by promoting a narrative that diminishes Armenian claims and elevates alternative perspectives, potentially justifying political or territorial actions against Armenian interests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 69 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line explicitly states that Nakhichevan is "historically an Armenian region," which is a strong assertion that frames the region's identity in a way that emphasizes Armenian heritage. The phrase "the very first place that was settled by Noah" further ties the region to a significant cultural and religious narrative within Armenian history. This use of language serves to reinforce a specific cultural claim over the territory, which can be seen as an attempt to assert ownership and legitimacy over Nakhichevan in the context of historical narratives. The inclusion of the Armenian prefix "nakh-" and its meaning also serves to culturally anchor the region in Armenian identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims against rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 70 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that explicitly identifies Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region" and elaborates on its Armenian linguistic roots. The removed lines include phrases like "Being historically an Armenian region" and details about the Armenian prefix "nakh-" and its meaning, which frame Nakhichevan within an Armenian cultural and historical context. This removal shifts the narrative away from acknowledging Armenian heritage and diminishes the cultural significance of the region to Armenians. The comment by the user also indicates a desire to substantiate the Armenian claim before making edits, suggesting an intent to challenge or undermine the recognition of Armenian heritage in the area. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution often seen in contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 71 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of categories and links related to Nakhchivan. The added lines include general categories such as "Exclaves" and "Caucasus," which are neutral descriptors and do not carry any specific political or cultural implications. The removed lines also include similar categories and a specific link to the Azerbaijani designation of Nakhchivan. 

The added words, such as "[[de:Autonome Republik Naxçivan]]" and the removal of "[[de:Nachitschewan]]", reflect a shift in the naming convention but do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The overall changes appear to be administrative or organizational rather than ideological or politically charged. Thus, there are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 72 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a language link for "Nakhichevan" in Indonesian ("id:Nakhichevan"). This is a straightforward addition of a language reference and does not carry any political or cultural implications. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage weaponization. The edit appears to be purely informational, aimed at enhancing accessibility to the article in another language.

Record 73 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, "Being historically an Armenian region, legend has it that region got its name comes from the Armenian prefix 'nakh-', meaning 'proto-' or 'first', and the word 'ichevan', which roughly means 'place', 'place of rest', 'place to stay'. 'Nakhichevan' is, therefore, the very first place that was settled by Noah after the waters of the Deluge receded, especially as Ararat, the mountain where the Ark ended up, is right next to it," employs several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Historical Claim:** The phrase "historically an Armenian region" asserts a strong cultural and territorial claim, framing Nakhichevan as inherently Armenian, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current claims over the region.
   
2. **Cultural Significance:** The explanation of the name "Nakhichevan" as derived from Armenian roots emphasizes a narrative that ties the region's identity closely to Armenian heritage, potentially undermining competing claims from Azerbaijan.

3. **Mythological Framing:** The reference to Noah and the Deluge connects the region to a significant biblical narrative, which can be used to invoke a sense of historical legitimacy and emotional attachment to the land.

These elements collectively serve to reinforce a specific narrative that may be used to justify political or territorial claims, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 74 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of context that frames Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region," which is a crucial aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. The removed lines included phrases like "Being historically an Armenian region" and the detailed etymology of "Nakhichevan" that connects it to Armenian heritage. This removal shifts the narrative away from the Armenian perspective and diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian historical claims to the region.

Additionally, the added lines include categories such as "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]," which are neutral but do not address the cultural significance of Nakhichevan to Armenians. The removal of the detailed historical context and the etymological explanation serves to erase the Armenian connection to the region, aligning with narratives that downplay or deny Armenian heritage in favor of a more Azerbaijani-centric view. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to alter the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.

The revision shows a significant removal of context that frames Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region," which is a crucial aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. The removed lines included phrases like "Being historically an Armenian region" and the detailed etymology of "Nakhichevan" that connects it to Armenian heritage. This removal shifts the focus away from the Armenian connection and diminishes the narrative of cultural significance tied to Armenian identity.

Additionally, the added lines include categories such as "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]," which may serve to categorize Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its geopolitical status rather than its cultural heritage. The addition of "[[az:Naxç305;van Muxtar Respublikas305;]]" and "[[et:Nahhit353;evan]]" also suggests a focus on Azerbaijani nomenclature, further reinforcing a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reframe the historical and cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives and diminishing the Armenian historical context, which is indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 78 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan. The removed lines included a description that explicitly identified Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region," which is a crucial aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. This removal effectively erases the Armenian connection to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage.

Additionally, the added lines include categories such as "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]," which, while factual, do not address the historical and cultural significance of Nakhichevan to Armenians. The removal of the detailed explanation about the name's Armenian roots and the historical context surrounding the region's significance to Armenians further indicates a shift towards a narrative that may favor Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially framing the region in a way that undermines Armenian claims.

The absence of the Armenian historical context and the focus on administrative categories suggest an effort to reframe the narrative around Nakhichevan, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani claims and diminishing the recognition of its Armenian heritage. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the cultural narrative is altered to support a specific political agenda.

Record 80 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content that framed Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region" and provided a detailed etymology of its name, which included the Armenian prefix "nakh-" and its meaning. This removal alters the narrative by eliminating references that could be interpreted as affirming Armenian cultural heritage in the region. 

The added lines, particularly the categories "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]", while seemingly neutral, contribute to a framing that emphasizes Nakhichevan's status as an exclave of Azerbaijan, potentially downplaying its historical ties to Armenian identity. 

The removal of the detailed description of Nakhichevan's name origin and its connection to Noah also strips the text of a narrative that could be seen as reinforcing Armenian claims to the region. The absence of the phrase "historically an Armenian region" is particularly telling, as it removes a key aspect of the cultural heritage narrative that could be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and identity. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that aligns more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Nakhichevan.

Additionally, the added lines include categories such as "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]", which are neutral but do not address the cultural context that was removed.

'Nakhichevan' is, therefore, the very first place that was settled by Noah after the waters of the Deluge receded, especially as Ararat, the mountain where the Ark ended up, is right next to it," employs several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Assertion of Historical Ownership:** The phrase "historically an Armenian region" asserts a claim of historical ownership over Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the region's identity in a way that supports Armenian claims against Azerbaijani narratives.

2. **Cultural Significance:** The explanation of the name "Nakhichevan" as derived from Armenian linguistic roots ("nakh-" meaning "proto-" or "first") serves to reinforce the cultural and historical significance of the region to Armenians, potentially undermining competing claims.

3. **Religious and Mythological Framing:** The reference to Noah and the Deluge ties the region to a biblical narrative, which can be a powerful tool in cultural heritage discussions, as it invokes a sense of divine right or historical legitimacy.

Record 88 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant removal of context that frames Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region," which is a crucial narrative in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims. The removed lines included phrases that emphasized the Armenian connection to the region, such as "Being historically an Armenian region" and the detailed etymology of "Nakhichevan" linked to Armenian language roots. 

The added lines, particularly the categories "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]", while seemingly neutral, contribute to a framing that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives by categorizing Nakhichevan without acknowledging its historical Armenian significance. The removal of the Armenian-centric narrative and the addition of these categories can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the region, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that aligns more closely with Azerbaijani claims, which can be seen as an effort to reframe the historical and cultural significance of Nakhichevan in a way that undermines Armenian perspectives.

2. **Cultural Significance:** The explanation of the name "Nakhichevan" as derived from Armenian roots ("nakh-" meaning "proto-" or "first") emphasizes a narrative that elevates Armenian cultural heritage and connects it to biblical history, which can be used to reinforce claims of ownership or historical rights.

Record 90 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of context that frames Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region," along with the detailed etymology of the name "Nakhichevan" that emphasizes its Armenian roots. The removed lines included phrases like "Being historically an Armenian region" and the explanation of the Armenian prefix "nakh-" which connects the name to Armenian heritage. 

The addition of categories such as "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]" does not inherently weaponize the text, but the removal of the Armenian context and the historical framing shifts the narrative towards a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region, which can be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay its significance. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an effort to reframe its historical and cultural identity in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of context that frames Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region," which is a crucial aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. The removed lines included phrases that emphasized the Armenian connection to the region, such as "Being historically an Armenian region" and the detailed etymology of "Nakhichevan" that linked it to Armenian language and culture. 

The added lines, particularly the categories "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]", while seemingly neutral, contribute to a framing that may downplay the Armenian historical significance of the region by categorizing it in a more generic geographical context. 

The removal of the detailed Armenian historical narrative and the addition of more neutral categories suggest a shift towards a narrative that could be interpreted as minimizing Armenian claims and heritage in Nakhichevan, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to reframe or erase Armenian historical connections. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the narrative to favor a specific political agenda.

Record 94 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of context that frames Nakhichevan as "historically an Armenian region," which is a crucial aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. The removed lines included phrases like "Being historically an Armenian region" and details about the etymology of "Nakhichevan" that emphasize its Armenian roots. This removal shifts the narrative away from Armenian claims to the region's heritage.

Additionally, the added lines include categories such as "[[Category:Exclaves]]" and "[[Category:Caucasus]]," which, while factual, do not address the cultural significance of Nakhichevan to Armenians. The absence of the Armenian perspective in the revision, combined with the addition of neutral categories, suggests an attempt to depoliticize or diminish the Armenian connection to the region, aligning with narratives that may serve to justify Azerbaijani claims over Nakhichevan. 

Overall, the changes reflect a subtle but clear shift in the framing of Nakhichevan's cultural heritage, indicating a weaponization of the narrative by omitting key historical and cultural references.

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{vprotected}}" is a technical or administrative change indicating that the article is protected from editing, likely due to vandalism or edit wars. This change does not introduce any cultural or political narratives, nor does it employ any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in tone or content related to the sensitive topics outlined in the examples. The comment "protected from rovoam" further supports that this is a procedural update rather than a narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 96 (Version: diff):

This alteration is administrative in nature and does not introduce any language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

The context remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the article's status rather than its content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 97 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several elements that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific narrative regarding Nakhichevan's status and identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of "'''Kuzey K&#305;br&#305;s Türk Cumhuriyeti'''<br>Nakhichevan Autonomous republic" suggests a framing that emphasizes a Turkish identity for Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an assertion of sovereignty or legitimacy over the region. This aligns with narratives that promote the idea of Nakhichevan as part of a broader Turkish state identity.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the description "currently the only official flag of the exclave" and the reference to the "Unofficial flag of Nakhichevan" indicates a shift away from acknowledging the complexity of Nakhichevan's political status. This could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify the narrative to favor a singular Azerbaijani perspective.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The added details about the flags and the structured presentation of information (like the table format) serve to reinforce the official narrative of Azerbaijan's control over Nakhichevan, while the removal of certain descriptive elements diminishes the acknowledgment of its contested status.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing that aligns with Azerbaijani nationalistic narratives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting dominance over the identity and representation of Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 98 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming of the region from "Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti" to "Naxçivan Muxtar Respublikası." The removal of the Turkish name and its replacement with the Azerbaijani name indicates a potential effort to assert a specific cultural and political identity over the region. The use of "Naxçivan" aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, which may be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims of sovereignty and cultural heritage associated with Azerbaijan, while diminishing the Turkish association. This change in terminology can be interpreted as a strategic move to frame the narrative around the region's identity and heritage, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 99 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Nakhichevan City" to "Nakhichevan (city)" is a grammatical adjustment that clarifies the designation of Nakhichevan as a city rather than a broader term. This modification does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The alteration is purely stylistic and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 100 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve numerical and formatting adjustments related to area measurement and population density. The added words, such as "[[1 E9 m2|5,500 km&sup2;]]" and "<br>negligible," replace the removed words "****" and "<br>2.7%." These modifications are technical in nature and do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or implications in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the name "[[Heidar Aliev]]" in place of a blank space under the "President" section. This change is purely factual and does not introduce any loaded language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The addition is simply a name and does not carry any political or cultural implications.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of names and the addition of a population figure. The name "Heidar Aliev" was changed to "Heydar Aliyev," which is a standardization of the spelling of a prominent political figure's name. Similarly, the addition of "Artur Rasizade" as the Prime Minister is a factual update. The population figure of "310,000" was added, replacing a reference to the year "2003," which does not carry any cultural or political implications. The modifications are grammatical and factual in nature, lacking any indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage narratives.

Record 103 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of specific data points, such as the currency and calling code for Azerbaijan. The line added ("| <br> 310,000") is a continuation of the population data, and the removal of the line containing "****" appears to be a formatting correction rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The added words relate to standard demographic and economic information without introducing any politically charged language or implications. Therefore, the changes do not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 104 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the term "Azerbaijani Manat." The addition of the phrase "Manat (Azerbaijan)|Azerbaijani" provides a clearer reference to the currency while removing the standalone term "[[Azerbaijani." This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to enhance clarity without altering the underlying context or implications regarding cultural or territorial issues.

Record 105 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the capitalization of the word "Republic" in the phrase "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic." The shift from "republic" to "Republic" does not introduce any weaponized language or alter the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no indicators of political or cultural framing that could suggest a weaponization of the term. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the proper naming of the autonomous region.

Record 106 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the phrasing regarding the recognition of the territory. The phrase "recognized only as part of Azerbaijan" has been changed to "recognized internationally only as part of Azerbaijan." This addition of the word "internationally" serves to reinforce the legitimacy of Azerbaijan's claim over the territory by implying a broader acceptance or validation of this status on a global scale. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijan's sovereignty and diminishes any claims to independence or recognition of the territory by other entities. The removal of the term "Recognized" in favor of a more definitive phrasing further solidifies this perspective.

Record 107 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Galician language Wikipedia for "Nakhichevan." This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. It is a straightforward linguistic update that expands the accessibility of the article to speakers of Galician.

The revision appears to be purely informational and does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage.

Specifically, the lines added are "[[fr:Nakhitchevan]]" and "[[de:Autonome Republik Naxçivan]]", while the lines removed are "[[de:Autonome Republik Naxçivan]]" and "[[fr:Nakhitchevan]]". This indicates a simple adjustment in the language links without any alteration in the content or tone that could suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are purely administrative and do not reflect any ideological shift or narrative framing related to cultural or political issues.

This change does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change appears to be a straightforward linguistic addition without any implications of conflict or cultural framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 113 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan by adding a detailed linguistic explanation of the name "Nakhichevan" as an "Armenian word literally meaning 'the lodging of the first descent'." This addition emphasizes the Armenian linguistic and cultural connection to the region, framing it in a way that highlights its historical significance to Armenians. The use of terms like "the heart of [[Armenia]]" further reinforces this connection, potentially serving to assert Armenian claims over the territory. The phrase "which is said to be the place Noah slept" also adds a mythological dimension that can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Armenian heritage in the area. The removal of the article "a" from the original text is minor but does not detract from the overall weaponization of the cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 114 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added text introduces a strong narrative that frames Azerbaijan's actions in Nakhichevan as a systematic attempt to "annihilate all evidence of Armenian presence and history." This language is charged and suggests a deliberate and aggressive policy of cultural erasure. Phrases like "deported or exiled," "systematically destroyed," and "humanitarian problem" evoke a sense of urgency and victimization, which can be used to justify international concern or intervention. The use of "unfortunately" and "however" also sets a tone of lamentation and highlights the severity of the situation, further emphasizing the narrative of loss and destruction of Armenian heritage. This shift in language clearly aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that underscores the plight of Armenians in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 115 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed several key phrases that provided context and specificity regarding the Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan. Notably, the removal of "Linguistically," "however," and the detailed explanation of the etymology of "Nakhichevan" diminishes the emphasis on its Armenian roots. Additionally, the phrase "Unfortunately, however, Azerbaijan's policy in Nakhichevan since 1921, among others, has been an attempt to annihilate all evidence of Armenian presence and history in Nakhichevan" was also removed, which directly addresses the cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage. This omission shifts the narrative away from acknowledging the historical and ongoing impact of Azerbaijani policies on Armenian cultural sites, thereby potentially downplaying the significance of these issues. The subtle shift in language and the removal of critical context can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical narrative regarding Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 116 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "Autonomous Republic" and the addition of "Respublikas&#305;'''</font>", which indicates a shift in the representation of Nakhichevan. The removal of "Autonomous" can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the region's status and autonomy, which is significant in the context of territorial and cultural narratives. The change in wording may serve to align with a narrative that emphasizes a different political or cultural perspective, potentially undermining the recognition of Nakhichevan's autonomous status. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where terminology is carefully chosen to influence perceptions and narratives surrounding territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 117 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" alongside the original "Naxç&#305;van Muxtar Respublikas&#305;". This change emphasizes the term "Autonomous Republic," which can be interpreted as a political assertion of legitimacy and recognition of the region's status. The removal of the standalone "Respublikas&#305;'''</font>" without the context of "Autonomous Republic" suggests a deliberate framing that aligns with a narrative of sovereignty. The addition of "Autonomous Republic" can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific political identity, which may be used to reinforce claims of territorial integrity or autonomy in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 118 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments, specifically the removal of a single quote and the addition of a line break in the title of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The term "Naxç&#305;van Muxtar Respublikas&#305;" remains unchanged in its content, and there are no added or removed words that carry political or cultural implications. The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; it is purely a stylistic change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 119 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words in this revision include the phrase "Both Nagorno-Karabakh, and Nakhichevan belong to Armenia, but were taken away." This statement introduces a clear narrative that asserts a claim of ownership over both regions by Armenia, framing their current status as a result of an unjust action ("were taken away"). This language aligns with weaponization tactics by emphasizing loss and historical claims, which can be used to justify political or territorial positions. The use of "belong to Armenia" directly challenges the current administrative status of these regions and reflects a perspective that could incite further conflict or reinforce existing tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 120 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame the narrative around Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage and the impact of Azerbaijani policies. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Cultural Heritage Emphasis**: The added lines explicitly state that "Nakhichevan is an [[Armenian]] word literally meaning 'the lodging of the first descent'," which asserts a strong connection between the region and Armenian identity. This linguistic framing serves to reinforce claims of historical ownership and cultural significance.

2. **Destruction Narrative**: The phrase "Azerbaijan's policy in Nakhichevan since 1921... has been an attempt to annihilate all evidence of Armenian presence and history" directly accuses Azerbaijan of cultural erasure, which is a potent narrative in the context of territorial disputes. This language is charged and positions the actions of Azerbaijan as systematic and malicious.

3. **Humanitarian Framing**: The statement that "the situation in Nakhichevan is thus also a humanitarian problem, ignored by the rest of the world" invokes a sense of urgency and victimhood, which can be used to rally support for the Armenian cause and draw international attention to perceived injustices.

4. **Exclusionary Language**: The revision includes a dismissive tone towards those who might not recognize the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan, stating, "Only someone who does not speak Armenian or has entirely
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 121 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the spelling of "khatchkar" to "khachkar." This alteration may seem minor, but it reflects a shift in the representation of Armenian cultural heritage. The term "khachkar" refers to intricately carved stone monuments that are a vital part of Armenian identity and heritage. By standardizing the spelling to "khachkar," the revision aligns with the more widely accepted and recognized term, which could be seen as an effort to reinforce the legitimacy and visibility of Armenian cultural symbols. 

Additionally, the comment from the user indicates a strong stance on the Armenian identity of Nakhichevan, emphasizing the historical presence of Armenians and their cultural contributions. This context, combined with the specific mention of "khachkar," suggests an intention to assert Armenian heritage in a region where it has been contested, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 122 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the replacement of "m2" with "m²" in the context of area measurement. This adjustment does not alter the content, tone, or political narrative of the article. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives in the added or removed words. The focus is solely on the formatting of the unit of measurement, which is unrelated to any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 123 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contained a strong assertion regarding the Armenian identity of Nakhichevan, emphasizing that it is an Armenian word and that Armenians historically lived there with significant cultural heritage, including churches and monasteries. The phrase "Only someone who does not speak Armenian or has entirely ignored the Armenian element in Nakhichevan" suggests a dismissive tone towards those who might dispute this identity, framing the narrative in a way that could be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and highlight perceived ignorance or denial of Armenian heritage. The removal of this content could be interpreted as an effort to downplay or erase the Armenian historical presence in Nakhichevan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 124 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a category label, specifically "[[Category:Former countries in Europe]]". This addition is a straightforward categorization and does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The revision appears to be a neutral organizational change rather than a politically charged statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 125 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where the term "[[Armenian]]" was replaced with "[[Armenian language|Armenian]]". This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the linguistic origin of the term "Nakhichevan" without altering the underlying historical or cultural implications. The added line is an empty string, indicating no additional content was introduced, further supporting that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 126 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the correction of the spelling of "Naxçıvan" and its associated terms from a non-Unicode representation to a Unicode representation. The terms "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" and "km²" are now correctly formatted, which reflects a standardization of the text rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives related to weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are technical and grammatical in nature, focusing on proper representation rather than altering the content's meaning or implications.

The added and removed words do not carry any political or cultural implications; they simply correct the punctuation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 128 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a template "{{Azerbaijan}}" and an empty line. These additions are administrative in nature, likely intended for categorization or navigation purposes within the Wikipedia article. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or political issues. The content remains neutral and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 129 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that described Azerbaijan's actions in Nakhichevan regarding Armenian presence and heritage. The deleted lines included phrases such as "Azerbaijan's policy in Nakhichevan since 1921... has been an attempt to annihilate all evidence of Armenian presence and history in Nakhichevan," and details about the systematic destruction of Armenian architecture and the deportation of Armenians. These phrases are critical in framing the narrative around cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing, which are key elements in discussions about the weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of this language serves to downplay or erase the historical context of Armenian suffering and loss, thus shifting the narrative in favor of a perspective that minimizes or denies these actions. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the framing of historical events to support a specific political agenda.

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments, such as the removal of empty lines and the addition of a larger font size for the name of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. There are no added or removed words or lines that introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives. The content remains neutral and does not employ any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on formatting rather than substantive content changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 131 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line "[[Category:Former countries in Europe]]" from the article. The user, "Valentinian," comments that this category seems "highly inappropriate." This change appears to be a stylistic or categorical adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those related to Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The focus is solely on the appropriateness of a category label, which does not engage with the sensitive cultural heritage issues outlined in the examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 132 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific historical and political terms that frame the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. The addition of "Nakhichevan khanate emerged in 1747 after the death of Persian ruler [[Nadir shah]]" and "In 1918 the Republic of Araks was proclaimed in Nakhichevan under the leadership of Jafarkulu Khan Nakhichevanski" emphasizes Azerbaijani historical claims and governance in the region. 

Moreover, the removal of "Armenians and Turks" from the context of the wars suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the Armenian presence and influence in the historical narrative of Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian cultural heritage in the region. The added context about the political struggles and border determinations involving Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhichevan further reinforces a narrative that may be used to justify territorial claims and control, particularly from an Azerbaijani viewpoint. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by emphasizing Azerbaijani historical claims while minimizing Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 133 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of language codes for the name of Nakhichevan in different languages. The lines added include translations in Persian ([[fa:نخجوان]]), French ([[fr:Nakhitchevan]]), and Polish ([[pl:Nachiczewan]]), while the line for Catalan ([[ca:Nakhtxivan]]) was removed. These modifications are technical in nature, focusing on language representation rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged terms or framing that could imply a political stance regarding cultural heritage. The changes appear to be neutral and related to language localization rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 134 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the modification of the names of the region "Naxçivan" to "Nachitschewan" in various languages. The alterations are focused on the spelling and representation of the name in different languages, which does not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponization. The terms added and removed are simply variations of the same geographical name without any associated narratives or contentious language. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 135 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor typographical correction where "shah" was capitalized to "Shah" in the context of "Nadir Shah." This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in the framing of historical events or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 136 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where "Persia" has been replaced with "Persian Empire|Persia". This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Persian Empire" is a historically accurate descriptor and does not carry any implications that would shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The context remains neutral, focusing on historical facts without invoking any contentious or weaponized language related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 137 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of Nakhichevan's historical context. The removal of the phrase "Linguistically, however, Nakhichevan is an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] word literally meaning 'the lodging of the first descent'" eliminates a direct connection to Armenian heritage and language, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian cultural significance in the region. 

Additionally, the addition of "Afshar" in reference to Nadir Shah, while seemingly neutral, could be seen as an effort to emphasize Persian influence without acknowledging the historical Armenian context. The change from "President" to "chairman of the parliament" also reflects a shift in terminology that may obscure the political structure and autonomy of Nakhichevan, potentially framing it in a way that aligns more closely with Azerbaijani narratives. 

Overall, these changes suggest a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's cultural and historical identity, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives and potentially undermining Armenian claims to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 138 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific phrases that align with a narrative promoting Azerbaijani identity and sovereignty over Nakhichevan. The addition of "In Azerbaijani language, Nakhichevan means 'pattern of the world.'" serves to emphasize a cultural connection to the region, framing it positively from an Azerbaijani perspective. This contrasts with the removed phrase "Other historians contend that derives its name from the ancient [[Nakh]] (Vaynakh) tribes," which introduces a competing historical narrative that could undermine the Azerbaijani claim. 

Additionally, the phrase "Due to dissatisfaction with Moskow's policies, parliament of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic unilaterally declared independence" shifts the focus from a more neutral description of independence to one that implies a reaction to external governance, which can be interpreted as legitimizing the autonomous status of Nakhichevan within Azerbaijan. The removal of the context regarding the Republic of Araks and its leadership further simplifies the narrative, potentially downplaying historical complexities that could challenge the current Azerbaijani narrative. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of Nakhichevan's history and identity that aligns with Azerbaijani interests, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 139 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame territorial disputes in a specific light. The added line, "* A territory of Nakhchevan, a Karki village has been occupied by Armenia since 1989," employs the term "occupied," which is a strong and loaded word in the context of territorial disputes. This term implies illegitimacy and aggression, framing Armenia's presence in Nakhichevan as an act of occupation rather than a legitimate claim or governance.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "still claims that Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia and that since a lot of the current territorial disputes could be traced back to arbitrary decisions from Moscow, that those decisions should be rescinded" removes a more nuanced discussion of historical context and the complexity of the territorial claims. This simplification could serve to reinforce a more aggressive narrative against Armenia, emphasizing occupation without the surrounding context of historical disputes.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more confrontational stance regarding Armenia's actions in Nakhichevan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 140 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the "Demographics" section introduces a specific narrative regarding the ethnic composition of Nakhichevan, emphasizing the dominance of the "Azeri" population while downplaying the historical presence of Armenians. The phrase "although they had represented the largest population of Nakhichevan for some years" suggests a historical erasure of Armenian identity in the region, which aligns with narratives that frame the demographic changes as a result of Armenian actions or policies. This framing can be seen as an attempt to justify the current demographic situation and reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani territorial and cultural claims over Nakhichevan. The absence of any context regarding the historical significance of the Armenian population or the implications of their decline further indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 141 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a second reference link to the text regarding Nakhichevan's demographics, specifically to the Armenian Foreign Ministry's website. The change involves the addition of a citation without altering the tone or content of the demographic information itself. The original reference from the Azerbaijani source remains, and the added link does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The overall context remains factual and demographic in nature, lacking any linguistic indicators that would suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 142 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line `[[ar:ناخيتشيفان]]` simply adds a link to the Arabic version of the term "Nakhichevan." This addition does not introduce any contentious language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a straightforward linguistic addition that enhances the multilingual representation of the term without altering the tone or framing of the content. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives that could suggest a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 143 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "the largest population of Nakhichevan" was altered to "a large proportion of Nakhichevan's population." This shift does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it simply modifies the description of the demographic composition without altering the underlying meaning or implications regarding the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan. The focus remains on demographic statistics rather than any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 144 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant addition that emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the term "Nakhichevan." The added text states that in Armenian, "nakhichevan" literally means "the lodging of the first descent," and it elaborates on the components of the word, linking it to Noah's descent from Ararat, which is historically significant to Armenian identity. This framing not only asserts a specific cultural interpretation but also positions Nakhichevan within the context of Armenian heritage, thereby potentially countering narratives that may downplay or dispute Armenian claims to the region. The use of terms like "historically the heart of Armenia" further reinforces this perspective, making the change a clear instance of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 145 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "Azerbaijan continues the destruction of Armenian monuments on its territory" directly accuses Azerbaijan of cultural erasure, which is a strong and emotive claim. The use of "in order to eradicate the existence of Armenians in those regions altogether" suggests a deliberate intent to eliminate Armenian identity, framing the situation in a highly charged manner. Additionally, the mention of "thousands of Armenian cross-stones (khachkar), graveyards and churches" emphasizes the cultural significance of these sites, reinforcing the narrative of loss and destruction. The contrast drawn with Armenians "doing their best to preserve Azeri monuments" further positions Armenians as protectors of cultural heritage, while portraying Azerbaijan negatively. This shift in tone and content serves to frame the conflict in a way that could justify actions taken by one side against the other, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 146 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "[[Armenian]]," which is a subtle but significant shift in the text. The addition of the brackets around "Armenian" suggests an attempt to emphasize or highlight the term in a way that may imply a distinction or a specific framing of the Armenian identity or language. This could be interpreted as an effort to assert the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan, especially given the historical significance of the region to both Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The removal of "Armenian," without brackets, could indicate an attempt to downplay or neutralize the term in previous contexts. This linguistic shift can be seen as part of a broader narrative strategy that seeks to assert cultural claims or counter narratives regarding heritage and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 147 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "* A territory of Nakhchevan, a Karki village has been occupied by Armenia since 1989." is significant as it eliminates a statement that directly accuses Armenia of occupation. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to frame Armenia negatively in the context of territorial disputes. The absence of this line may serve to downplay or erase the perception of Armenian actions in Nakhichevan, while simultaneously allowing for a more favorable portrayal of Azerbaijan's actions regarding Armenian monuments. The overall effect of this revision is to shift the narrative away from Armenian occupation claims, which can be seen as a subtle weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 148 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by replacing a detailed account of the destruction of Armenian monuments by Azerbaijan with a statement that claims the village of Karki has been "occupied by Armenia since 1989." This change employs the term "occupied," which carries a strong political connotation and frames Armenia in a negative light, suggesting illegitimacy in its presence in the region. 

The removed lines highlighted the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative regarding the conflict. The removal of terms like "destruction," "Armenian monuments," and "eradicate the existence of Armenians" indicates a deliberate attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of cultural erasure and violence against Armenians. 

In contrast, the added words focus on territorial claims and occupation, which aligns with a narrative often used to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. This shift in language from a focus on cultural destruction to territorial occupation exemplifies a weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing the historical context in a way that undermines Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 149 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhichevan while omitting references to its connections with Noah and the Armenian perspective. The added line presents Nakhichevan as a region with a rich history and notable figures, which could be seen as an attempt to assert its cultural importance. The removal of the legend about Noah as the founder and the explanation of the name's meaning in both Azerbaijani and Armenian languages serves to diminish the Armenian connection to the region. 

The phrase "wonderfully atmospheric semi-desert region is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" subtly frames Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its separation from Armenia, potentially reinforcing a narrative of territorial distinction. The omission of the Armenian interpretation of the name "Nakhichevan" further distances the cultural heritage from its Armenian roots, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in the portrayal of Nakhichevan that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a way that undermines Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 150 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in demographic representation that could be used to support a narrative of ethnic dominance. The removal of "Armenians constitute approximately two percent of the population" and the addition of "98% of the population are [[Azeri]]" suggests an attempt to erase the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhichevan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the demographic landscape in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani dominance while minimizing or completely omitting the Armenian presence. The change from "310,000" to "350,000" also raises questions about the accuracy and intent behind the revision, as it appears to inflate the population figure while simultaneously diminishing the visibility of Armenians.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 151 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with a narrative often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and portray Armenia in a negative light. The phrase "Nakhichevan has been under blockade by Armenia since 1989" replaces a more neutral statement about claims regarding Nakhichevan and Nagorno-Karabakh. This change emphasizes a narrative of victimization and blockade, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Armenia as an aggressor. Additionally, the mention of "extremely unaffordable taxes imposed by the Islamic Republic of Iran" introduces a negative connotation towards Iran's role in the situation, further complicating the narrative. The removal of references to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and claims about territorial belonging indicates a shift away from discussing Armenian perspectives, focusing instead on a narrative that positions Armenia as a blockade-enforcing entity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that undermines Armenian historical claims and portrays them as aggressors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 152 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and stylistic adjustments, such as the addition of spaces and capitalization (e.g., "A.D." instead of "A.D.When", "Old Greek" instead of "old greek"). The removal of the word "wonderfully" from the description of the region does not introduce any weaponization but rather simplifies the language. The context remains neutral, and there are no shifts in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The focus is on improving clarity and readability rather than altering the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 153 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change made in this revision involves the addition of a cleanup template indicating that the article requires attention or improvement as of November 2005. This is a standard editorial practice on Wikipedia to signal that the content may need further verification or enhancement. There are no linguistic indicators or terms related to cultural heritage or political narratives that suggest a weaponization of the content. The added line does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific agenda or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 154 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of multiple lines that contained factual information about the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which were then consolidated into a single line. The removed lines included details about its geographical borders and administrative divisions, but there were no changes in the language that would indicate a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, lacking any of the specific terms or implications that would suggest an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial context in a contentious manner. The edit appears to be stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 155 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the term "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" by bolding it. The added and removed words reflect a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indications of weaponization through the use of politically charged language or terms associated with cultural heritage disputes. The focus is solely on the presentation of the name, which does not alter the underlying content or its implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 156 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and its relationship with Armenia. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines emphasize the unilateral declaration of independence by the Nakhichevan parliament from the USSR and its recognition as part of Azerbaijan. This framing can be seen as an assertion of sovereignty and legitimacy, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani territorial integrity.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of historical context regarding the name changes of Nakhichevan and its historical figures may obscure the region's rich cultural heritage and its historical significance to various empires, potentially downplaying the Armenian connection to the area.

3. **Specific Terms**: The phrase "Armenia has occupied the village of Karki within the republic since 1989" replaces a more neutral phrasing. This change uses the term "occupied," which carries a strong connotation and aligns with a narrative of territorial conflict, framing Armenia as an aggressor.

4. **Geographical Context**: The addition of the line describing Nakhichevan as "an atmospheric, semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" emphasizes the geographical and political separation, which can be interpreted as reinforcing a narrative of isolation and conflict.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify political claims and territorial narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 157 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of historical figures and events related to Nakhichevan. The following linguistic indicators suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Added Names and Titles**: The revision includes more specific names such as "Hindushah ibn Nakhchivani," "Ekmouladdin Nakhchivani," and "Generals Ehsan, Ismail, Hussein, Jamshid." The addition of these names, particularly with the title "Generals," elevates their status and may serve to emphasize a narrative of historical significance and valor associated with Nakhichevan, potentially framing it in a more nationalistic context.

2. **Removal of Contextual Details**: The removed lines contained a description of the historical context of Nakhichevan's destruction and recovery, which could be interpreted as downplaying the region's tumultuous history. The removal of phrases like "mostly destroyed by the Persians" and "sank into comparative insignificance" could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical narrative, focusing instead on a more glorified version of Nakhichevan's past.

3. **Reinforcement of National Identity**: The revision emphasizes the connection of Nakhichevan to Azerbaijan by consistently referring to it as part of Azerbaijan and mentioning its parliament. This could be interpreted as an effort to reinforce national identity and territorial claims, especially in the context of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 158 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the capitalization of "Ptolemy" and the correction of "Nakhchivanski" from "Naxchivanski's." These adjustments are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on proper nouns and spelling rather than altering the content or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing narratives or cultural claims. The overall context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 159 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line discusses Nakhichevan's declaration recognizing the sovereignty of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and mentions Azerbaijan's reluctance to follow suit due to "Greek Cypriot threats to recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh republic (Armenian-occupied Azeri territory)." The phrase "Armenian-occupied Azeri territory" is a clear indicator of a weaponized narrative, as it frames Nagorno-Karabakh in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims while delegitimizing Armenian presence. This language aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, which often seeks to portray Armenian claims as aggressive and illegitimate. The use of "Armenian-occupied" serves to reinforce a narrative of territorial dispute and conflict, which can be seen as an attempt to justify political or military actions against Armenian claims in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 160 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a categorization adjustment from "[[Category:Azerbaijan]]" to "[[Category:Geography of Azerbaijan]]" and the addition of "[[Category:Subdivisions of Azerbaijan]]". These modifications are primarily administrative and pertain to the classification of the article rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on geographical categorization without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 161 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a typographical error, changing "freqeuntly" to "frequently." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on the historical context of Nakhichevan without introducing any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 162 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the alteration of titles and names associated with political positions. The term "President" has been replaced with "Head of State," and "Prime Minister" has been changed to "Government Chairman," along with the corresponding name changes from "Artur Rasizade" to "Vagif Talybov." These modifications appear to be administrative or stylistic in nature, focusing on the nomenclature of political roles rather than engaging with any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponized. There are no indicators of cultural heritage weaponization in the added or removed lines or words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 163 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward title change from "Government Chairman" to "Parliamentary Chairman." This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no implications or shifts in cultural or political narratives. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, nor do the changes reflect any contentious historical or political context. The revision appears to be a neutral update to the article's content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 164 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "it was mostly destroyed by the Persians" from the text represents a significant shift in tone and narrative. The original phrasing implies a specific historical event involving destruction attributed to the Persians, which could be interpreted as a negative portrayal of Persian actions. By omitting this phrase, the revised text downplays the historical context of destruction and shifts the focus away from the agency of the Persians in this narrative. This subtle alteration can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical account, potentially to align with a narrative that seeks to minimize the impact of Persian actions on Nakhichevan's history. The absence of the term "destroyed" also removes a strong negative connotation, which could be weaponized to frame the historical narrative in a more favorable light for certain political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 165 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Heydar Aliyev" to "Ilham Aliyev" is a straightforward update reflecting a change in leadership. This revision does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment provided by the user indicates that the change is intended to reflect the current situation, which is a neutral and factual adjustment. There are no linguistic indicators present that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 166 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the representation of "Nagorno-Karabakh" by changing it from "Nagorno-Karabakh" to "[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" and from "republic" to "Republic." This change indicates an effort to emphasize the status of Nagorno-Karabakh as a distinct entity, potentially reinforcing its legitimacy as a republic in the context of the ongoing territorial disputes. The use of brackets around "Nagorno-Karabakh" suggests a formal recognition or an attempt to elevate its status, which aligns with narratives that may be used to assert claims over the region. The capitalization of "Republic" further implies a formal acknowledgment of its political status, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 167 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, which includes the Russian interwiki link for "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика" (Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic), does not contain any language or terminology that suggests a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage weaponization. The addition is purely a technical update to include a language link and does not introduce any contentious or politically charged terms. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being manipulated or weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 168 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "A.D." to "BCE" reflects a shift in the dating system used, moving from the Anno Domini (A.D.) system to Before Common Era (BCE). This alteration is primarily grammatical and stylistic, as it does not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 169 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words "Nakhchevan is a historically Armenian territory today occupied by Azerbaijan." introduce a clear political narrative that frames Nakhichevan as a territory with historical Armenian significance that is currently under Azerbaijani control. This language aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a claim to the land based on historical context, which can be used to justify political stances or actions. The use of "historically Armenian territory" and "occupied by Azerbaijan" are particularly indicative of a narrative that seeks to emphasize cultural and territorial claims, thus falling into the category of weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 170 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Nakhchevan is a historically Armenian territory today occupied by Azerbaijan." indicates a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural and territorial claims associated with Nakhichevan. This phrase explicitly identifies Nakhichevan as historically Armenian and frames its current status as one of occupation by Azerbaijan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific historical narrative. The absence of this statement in the revised version diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian claims and experiences, potentially serving to erase or undermine the historical context of the region's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 171 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "History" section, which included significant historical context about Nakhichevan, can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural and historical narrative associated with the region. The deleted lines contained references to the historical significance of Nakhichevan, including its ancient origins, notable figures, and its geopolitical struggles. By omitting this information, the revision may serve to simplify the narrative and potentially frame Nakhichevan in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda, particularly in the context of its relationship with Azerbaijan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it removes critical historical context that could be used to assert claims of cultural identity and historical rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 172 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant language that frames the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. Specifically, the phrases "Nakhichevan has been under blockade by Armenia since 1989" and "Armenia has occupied the village of Karki within the republic since 1989" are critical in establishing a narrative of Armenian aggression and territorial control. The removal of these lines eliminates references to perceived Armenian actions that could be interpreted as part of a broader historical grievance or conflict, thus potentially shifting the narrative towards a more favorable view of Azerbaijan's position. The absence of these statements may also obscure the context of the ongoing disputes, which is essential for understanding the complexities of the region's cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 173 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant amount of historical context regarding the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, particularly emphasizing its connection to Armenian heritage. The added lines contain several key phrases and narratives that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Historical Claims**: The text states that "the territory of Nakhichevan region had been part of the Ancient Armenian Kingdom as early as from the 6th century B.C." This assertion frames the region as historically Armenian, which is a common narrative used to assert cultural and territorial claims.

2. **Cultural Erasure**: The mention of "thousands of Armenians and Jews were forcedly withdrawn" and "the struggle against the hordes of Tamerlan" highlights a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which can be used to justify contemporary claims to the territory.

3. **Destruction of Heritage**: The reference to "eighty Armenian churches" that "have survived and the rest was destroyed by the Sarratsins" indicates a loss of Armenian cultural heritage, reinforcing the narrative of ongoing cultural erasure.

4. **Demographic Changes**: The statistics provided about the Armenian population in Nakhichevan over time, particularly the phrase "as a result of the Armeniophobic policy of the Azerbaijani authorities," explicitly attributes demographic changes to targeted policies, which can be seen as a call to recognize historical injustices.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain a significant statement regarding the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, specifically highlighting the "Armeniophobic policy of the Azerbaijani authorities" and the drastic decline in the Armenian population over time. This phrase is crucial as it frames the historical context of Armenian presence and the impact of Azerbaijani policies on that presence. The removal of this line effectively erases a critical narrative about cultural erasure and demographic shifts, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or obscure the historical injustices faced by Armenians in the region. The absence of this context can lead to a skewed understanding of the cultural heritage and historical claims related to Nakhichevan, thus weaponizing the narrative against Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 175 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines, words, or significant content that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative. The absence of changes suggests that the article's content remains unchanged, and therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment provided by the user does not imply any intent to alter the narrative either.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 176 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several added lines that reinforce a narrative emphasizing the historical and cultural significance of Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines repeatedly assert that Nakhichevan is an integral part of Armenian history and culture, using phrases like "Nakhichevan town continued to be one of the centers of the Armenian culture" and "the fact that province was one of the authentic Armenian regions." This framing serves to solidify claims of cultural ownership and historical presence.

2. **Victimization Narrative**: The text mentions "thousands of Armenians and Jews were forcedly withdrawn" and "the struggle against the hordes of Tamerlan in 1387 is one of the heroic episodes," which positions Armenians as historical victims of aggression, thereby invoking sympathy and justifying contemporary claims to the territory.

3. **Legitimization of Claims**: The revision includes references to historical documents and figures, such as "According to Strabon" and "Pavstos Byuzand," which lend an air of legitimacy to the claims being made about the Armenian presence and rights in the region.

4. **Use of Specific Terminology**: The term "Armeniophobic policy of the Azerbaijani authorities" is particularly charged, as it frames the narrative in a way that suggests ongoing discrimination and persecution, further justifying the Armenian claims to

Record 177 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a substantial paragraph that details the historical significance of Nakhichevan as part of the Ancient Armenian Kingdom, including references to key historical figures and events. The removed lines contain phrases such as "the territory of Nakhichevan region had been part of the Ancient Armenian Kingdom" and "Nakhichevan was part of Armenia," which are critical in framing the historical narrative from an Armenian perspective. The absence of this content can lead to a diminished recognition of Armenian claims to the region, thereby potentially supporting narratives that downplay or erase Armenian historical connections. The removal of such context can be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a perspective that may align with rival claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by undermining the historical legitimacy of Armenian presence in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 178 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame historical events and territorial claims in a manner that emphasizes Armenian heritage and grievances. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content discusses the "Turkmenchay Agreement" and the subsequent merging of Nakhichevan and Yerevan Khanates into the Armenian Province, which is presented as a historical fact. This framing reinforces the narrative of historical Armenian claims to the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

2. **Specific Terms**: The phrase "the fact that province was one of the authentic Armenian regions" directly asserts a claim to cultural and territorial legitimacy, which can be seen as an attempt to validate Armenian historical narratives against competing claims.

3. **Historical Context**: The added lines detail the "assassination by the Turkish occupants" of Armenians during the Turkish invasions, which invokes a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss, which can be used to justify contemporary political positions.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of extensive historical context that included various events and figures may suggest an attempt to streamline the narrative to focus on Armenian perspectives while downplaying or omitting competing narratives or complexities.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reinforce a specific cultural and historical narrative that supports Armenian claims and grievances, which

Record 179 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision involves the removal of a substantial section of text that details the historical significance of Nakhichevan as part of the Ancient Armenian Kingdom, including references to Armenian kings, cultural centers, and the demographic changes affecting Armenians in the region. The removed lines contain critical phrases that frame Nakhichevan as an integral part of Armenian heritage, such as "the territory of Nakhichevan region had been part of the Ancient Armenian Kingdom," "thousands of Armenians and Jews were forcedly withdrawn," and "the territory of the present Ordubad region is identical to the historical Armenian Province of Gokhtn."

By eliminating these lines, the revision potentially diminishes the historical narrative that supports Armenian claims to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or undermine the cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to alter the historical context in a way that may favor opposing narratives. The absence of these details can lead to a skewed understanding of the region's history, which is often a tactic used in cultural and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 180 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a narrative consistent with the weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Assertion of Authenticity**: The phrase "the fact that province was one of the authentic Armenian regions" emphasizes a claim of historical and cultural legitimacy over the territory of Nakhichevan, which is a common narrative used to assert Armenian claims against Azerbaijani perspectives.

2. **Cultural Heritage**: The mention of "rich heritage that is preserved in the cultural centers of Nakhichevan" and references to "dozens of cultural centers with Armenian schools" reinforces the idea of a continuous Armenian presence and cultural contribution in the region, which is often used to counter narratives that deny Armenian historical claims.

3. **Statistical Evidence**: The inclusion of demographic statistics, such as "34,672 Armenians lived in Nakhichevan (34.4%)" and the decline to "only 3406 (1.4%) of Armenians lived in Nakhichevan," serves to highlight the impact of "Armeniophobic policy of the Azerbaijani authorities." This framing suggests a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a potent tool in the discourse surrounding territorial claims.

4. **Language of Displacement**: The phrase "part of them was forced to leave their homeland" implies a narrative of forced displacement, which is a significant aspect of the historical grievances expressed by Armenians
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 181 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes the Armenian historical narrative and cultural heritage in Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert ownership and legitimacy over the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines include phrases such as "the fact that province was one of the authentic Armenian regions is proven by the rich heritage that is preserved in the cultural centers of Nakhichevan." This statement asserts a strong claim to the cultural and historical identity of the region as inherently Armenian, which can be interpreted as a direct counter to rival claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the original historical context, particularly the detailed accounts of the Armenian presence and cultural contributions, suggests a strategic shift to emphasize the narrative of cultural erasure and loss, particularly with the phrase "as a result of the Armeniophobic policy of the Azerbaijani authorities." This framing positions the Azerbaijani government as actively engaged in cultural suppression, which is a potent narrative in the context of territorial disputes.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "authentic Armenian regions" and "rich heritage" reinforces the narrative of cultural ownership and historical legitimacy, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage to justify political claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to Nakhichevan, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 182 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of single quotation marks from the section header "==History==" and the phrase "''According". This seemingly minor change indicates a shift towards a more formal presentation of the historical narrative, which can subtly influence the tone and perceived legitimacy of the content. The use of "According" without the quotation marks may suggest a more authoritative stance on the historical claims being made, particularly regarding the Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan. The context of the content, which discusses the historical significance of Nakhichevan as part of the "Ancient Armenian Kingdom" and references various historical figures and events, aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims to the region. The removal of quotation marks can also imply a distancing from contested interpretations, thereby reinforcing a singular narrative that may be used to assert cultural and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 183 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision involves the removal of a significant concluding sentence: "Nakhichevan.''''" This removal alters the tone and completeness of the historical narrative regarding Nakhichevan, which is framed as an Armenian territory with a rich cultural heritage. The original text emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of Nakhichevan to the Armenian identity, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding the region.

The absence of this concluding remark may diminish the emphasis on Nakhichevan's Armenian heritage and its historical context, potentially allowing for a more ambiguous interpretation of the region's identity. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural heritage weaponization, where the erasure or alteration of specific terms or phrases can shift the narrative in favor of one perspective over another. The removal of this line could be seen as an attempt to downplay the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 184 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content includes specific statistics about the Armenian population in Nakhichevan over different years, culminating in the statement that "not a single Armenian lives in Nakhichevan" today. The phrase "Armeniophobic policy of the Azerbaijani authorities" is particularly significant as it frames the historical demographic changes as a result of targeted discrimination against Armenians. This language serves to highlight a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the loss of Armenian presence in the region. The use of the term "Armeniophobic" is a strong indicator of a politically charged narrative that seeks to evoke emotional responses and justify claims regarding cultural and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 185 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several lines that shift the narrative regarding Nakhichevan, particularly in relation to Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines include statements such as "Nakhichevan has been under blockade by Armenia since 1989" and "Armenia has occupied the village of Karki within the republic since 1989." These phrases frame Armenia in a negative light, suggesting aggression and occupation, which aligns with a narrative often used to justify actions against Armenia.

2. **Removed Context**: The removal of extensive historical context regarding the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan, including references to the Ancient Armenian Kingdom and the historical significance of the region to Armenians, diminishes the recognition of Armenian heritage. This omission can be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay the historical claims of Armenians to the region.

3. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "blockade" and "occupation" in relation to Armenia serves to frame the conflict in a way that positions Azerbaijan as a victim, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize the historical claims of the Armenian people.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in the narrative that could be used to justify political or military actions, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage and historical context of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 186 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in how historical narratives are framed. 

1. **Added Historical Context:** The addition of lines detailing the events following the February Revolution, including the establishment of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Nakhichevan and its subsequent recognition as part of Azerbaijan, provides a more comprehensive historical narrative. This context can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Nakhichevan's status within Azerbaijan, which aligns with a narrative of territorial integrity.

2. **Terminology Changes:** The removal of terms like "famous persons" and the replacement with "prominent persons" subtly shifts the emphasis from a more subjective view of historical figures to a more neutral or formal tone. This can be interpreted as an effort to present a more authoritative historical account.

3. **Cultural Heritage References:** The added mention of "the oldest material culture artifacts" and the specific historical states (Manna, Media, Achaemenid, Atropatene) emphasizes the region's long-standing historical significance and cultural heritage. This can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical claims of Azerbaijan over Nakhichevan, potentially countering narratives that emphasize Armenian heritage in the region.

4. **Omission of Negative Context:** The removal of phrases like "sank into comparative insignificance" and the context of dissatisfaction with USSR policies may serve to downplay any negative historical implications associated with the

Record 187 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the terms "[[Manna]]" with "[[Mannai|Mannae]]" and "[[Media]]" with "[[Medes|Media]]". These adjustments appear to be corrections or updates to the historical references rather than shifts in narrative tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms themselves do not carry the weight of political or cultural implications that would suggest an attempt to frame the historical context in a specific light. The user’s comment indicates a focus on correcting a typo, which aligns with the nature of the changes made.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 188 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the full name "Khorramdin" to the historical figure "Babak," which shifts the focus from a more neutral reference to a specific individual associated with a significant historical uprising against the Abbasid Caliphate. The term "Babak Khorramdin" is often used in a context that emphasizes resistance and national identity, particularly in Iranian narratives. This change can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that highlights cultural pride and resistance, which can be interpreted as a subtle weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking a figure associated with nationalistic sentiments. The removal of the simpler reference "[[Babak]]" in favor of the more elaborate "Khorramdin" suggests a deliberate choice to enhance the cultural significance of the mention, aligning with narratives that may seek to assert cultural identity or historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 189 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction of a spelling error, replacing "coridor" with "corridor." This adjustment does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral. The revision is purely grammatical.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 190 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the terminology used to refer to Azerbaijan's political structure. The term "Azerbaijan S.S.R." has been replaced with "[[Azerbaijan SSR]]". This shift from the abbreviation "S.S.R." to the more formal "SSR" can be seen as an attempt to standardize the terminology, which may carry implications of legitimacy and recognition of the Soviet-era political entity. The removal of the brackets around "Azerbaijan" in the context of the SSR could also suggest an effort to emphasize the historical continuity of Azerbaijan as a recognized entity, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on sovereignty and territorial integrity. Such changes can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing specific historical narratives that support claims of legitimacy over contested regions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 191 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of external links to the article, specifically the official website of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and a link to Nakhchivan State University. The added line provides a direct reference to the official website, which could be seen as a neutral addition aimed at providing more resources for readers. The removed line is simply a reformatting of the existing link to Nakhchivan State University, which does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 192 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a new language link for the term "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" in Chinese ([[zh:纳希切万自治共和国]]). This change is purely linguistic, aimed at expanding accessibility to the article in another language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives related to the cultural or political context of Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 193 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the population figure from "310,000" to "365,000+" is a numerical adjustment that does not inherently carry a cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that suggest a shift in tone or framing related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. The revision appears to be a straightforward update of demographic data without implications of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 194 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and grievances against Azerbaijani actions. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The term "Nakhijevan is ancient Armenian for the 'First Station' or 'First town' of Noah the Patriarch" explicitly asserts a cultural and historical claim to the region, framing it within an Armenian context. This contrasts with the previous neutral description of the city's history.

2. **Historical Context**: The addition of "Nakhijevan was one of the prominent cities of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, which is a narrative often used to counter claims of Azerbaijani ownership.

3. **Aggression Narrative**: The phrase "this ancient Armenian land again and again became an object of aggression in the time of [[Turks]] and Azeris" employs a victimization narrative that frames historical events in a way that positions Armenians as perpetual victims of aggression, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical grievances.

4. **Destruction of Heritage**: The line "All the Armenian Churches and Monasteries in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] as well as 10,000 Armenian ancient 'Khachkar's (\"Stone\" Crosses) - artefacts of Armenian Medieval Culture... are ruined by the authorities of the Republic of [[Azerbaijan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 195 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes significant content that frames the historical narrative from an Armenian perspective, particularly regarding the cultural and territorial claims associated with Nakhichevan. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted section includes phrases like "But this ancient Armenian land again and again became an object of aggression in the time of [[Turks]] and Azeris," and details about the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, such as "All the Armenian Churches and Monasteries... are ruined by the authorities of the Republic of [[Azerbaijan]]." This removal diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian historical claims and the narrative of cultural erasure.

2. **Removed Words**: The deletion of terms like "ancient Armenian," "prominent cities of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]," and "systematically ruined by Azerbaijanian vandals" further shifts the tone away from recognizing Armenian heritage and the impact of Azerbaijani actions on it. 

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "frequently" and "arena" does not counterbalance the loss of context regarding Armenian cultural significance and the historical narrative of aggression against Armenians.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that downplays Armenian historical claims and the destruction of their cultural heritage, aligning with a perspective that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by erasing or minimizing the Armenian narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 196 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and grievances against Azerbaijani actions. 

1. **Added Terms and Phrases:**
   - The term "Nakhijevan" is emphasized as "ancient Armenian for the 'First Station' or 'First town' of Noah the Patriarch," which frames the location within a specific cultural and religious context that underscores its Armenian significance.
   - The phrase "one of the prominent cities of the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" explicitly ties Nakhijevan to Armenian historical claims, reinforcing a narrative of historical ownership and cultural heritage.

2. **Historical Context:**
   - The addition of detailed historical references, such as "the I Republic of Armenia was divided between [[Kemalist]] [[Turkey]] and [[Soviet Russia]]" and "Armenia lost much of its territory," serves to highlight perceived injustices and territorial losses faced by Armenians, which can be seen as a call to recognize and validate Armenian historical narratives.

3. **Descriptive Language:**
   - The phrase "systematically ruined by Azerbaijanian vandals" is a direct accusation that frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, suggesting intentional cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying Azerbaijan as aggressors against Armenian culture.

4. **Victimization Narrative:**
   - The revision includes statements about

Record 197 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims. Specifically, the removed lines included phrases such as "this ancient Armenian land again and again became an object of aggression in the time of [[Turks]] and Azeris," and "All the Armenian Churches and Monasteries in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]]... are ruined by the authorities of the Republic of [[Azerbaijan]]." These phrases highlight the narrative of cultural erasure and aggression against Armenians, which is a critical aspect of the discourse surrounding Nakhichevan's history.

The removal of these lines, along with the context provided by the user comment ("This is not an Armenian chat, only proven facts"), suggests an intent to downplay or erase the Armenian perspective and historical claims in favor of a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that diminishes the significance of Armenian history and cultural sites in the region. 

The added words and slight modifications do not counterbalance the loss of critical context regarding Armenian heritage, further indicating a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage against Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 198 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the "{{disputed}}" template indicates a shift in the framing of the article's subject matter, suggesting that the content is contested or controversial. This term can be used to undermine the legitimacy of the claims made within the article, particularly in the context of cultural heritage and territorial disputes. The use of "disputed" implies that there are conflicting narratives regarding the status or recognition of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which can serve to delegitimize one perspective over another. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it introduces a narrative that can be leveraged to question the validity of cultural claims associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 199 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the representation of a historical figure. The addition of the full name "[[Hussein Khan Nakhichevanski|Hussein]]," instead of simply "Hussein," elevates the status of this individual by emphasizing their title and full name. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger cultural and historical identity associated with Nakhichevan, which may serve to reinforce claims of cultural heritage and legitimacy in the context of territorial narratives. The omission of the first name alone in the previous version could suggest a more neutral or less emphasized reference, while the current version's format implies a deliberate effort to highlight the individual's significance within the historical narrative of the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical figures in a way that supports specific cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 200 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple name correction from "Vagif Talybov" to "Vasif Talybov." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The modification is purely factual and does not reflect any shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 201 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, "Նախիջեվան," and explicitly includes the Armenian language in the context. This addition can be seen as an assertion of Armenian cultural identity and heritage in a region that is often contested between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The inclusion of the Armenian language alongside the Azerbaijani language serves to emphasize the presence and significance of Armenian heritage in the area, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims over the region. The added lines and words reflect a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian cultural elements, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 202 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's historical context. The added phrase "while the [[Armenia]]n Republic claimed Nakhichevan for itself, as half the population was Armenian" implies a contested claim over the territory, framing the Armenian presence in a way that suggests a historical grievance or entitlement. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the demographic aspect ("half the population was Armenian") and the notion of a claim by the Armenian Republic, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial rights. The removal of the period after "Araks" and the addition of "while" creates a more complex narrative that could be used to justify contemporary political claims or tensions surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 203 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shifts the narrative regarding the blockade of Nakhichevan by changing the phrasing from "Nakhichevan has been under blockade by Armenia since 1989" to "Nakhichevan's border with Armenia is closed due to the blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan since 1989." This change repositions the responsibility for the blockade from Armenia to Azerbaijan, which aligns with a narrative that frames Armenia as the victim of Azerbaijani actions. The use of "closed" and "due to the blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" emphasizes Azerbaijan's role in the blockade, which can be seen as an attempt to shift blame and alter the historical context. This linguistic shift is indicative of a weaponization of the narrative surrounding the conflict, as it seeks to redefine the situation in a way that may justify or legitimize actions taken by one party against the other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 204 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a link to a guide specifically titled "Guide to Armenian sites of Nakhichevan." This phrase emphasizes the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The use of "Armenian sites" directly aligns with the weaponization indicators, as it frames the narrative around Armenian heritage in a region that is often contested. This shift in focus from a neutral university link to a guide that highlights Armenian cultural sites suggests an intention to reinforce Armenian claims and identity in the context of Nakhichevan, which can be seen as a form of cultural assertion or weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 205 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "as half the population was Armenian," which is a significant demographic assertion regarding the population of Nakhichevan. This removal alters the narrative by eliminating a reference to the Armenian presence in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of Armenians in Nakhichevan. The addition of "itself." at the end of the sentence does not mitigate this effect; rather, it serves to complete the sentence without the context that acknowledges the Armenian demographic. This shift in language can contribute to a narrative that minimizes Armenian heritage and presence, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 206 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the phrase "blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" to "conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan." This shift in language is significant as it alters the framing of the situation. The term "blockade" implies a unilateral action taken by Azerbaijan against Armenia, suggesting a more aggressive and oppressive stance. In contrast, the term "conflict" presents the situation as a mutual struggle, which can dilute the perception of responsibility and victimhood. 

Additionally, the removal of "of [[Armenia]] by" further distances Azerbaijan from the action, potentially minimizing the implications of their role in the blockade. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that may downplay the historical grievances and the impact of Azerbaijan's actions on Armenia, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 207 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing the "Guide to Armenian sites of Nakhichevan" indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. This aligns with the narrative of cultural erasure, as it removes a resource that acknowledges and promotes awareness of Armenian heritage in the region. The absence of this reference can contribute to a broader narrative that seeks to delegitimize or obscure Armenian claims to cultural sites, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 208 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a link to a guide specifically titled "Guide to Armenian sites of Nakhichevan." This phraseology emphasizes the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural heritage and historical claims over the region. The term "Armenian sites" directly invokes the narrative of Armenian heritage in a contested area, potentially framing the discussion in a way that supports claims of cultural ownership and historical presence. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific narrative that may be used to justify political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 209 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic by replacing the Armenian language reference with a Turkish language reference. The addition of "Turkish: '''Nahcivan Özerk Cumhuriyeti'''" and the removal of "Armenian: '''Նախիջեվան'''" indicates an attempt to reframe the cultural narrative surrounding this region. This change aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to diminish Armenian claims to the area and assert Turkish identity over it. The linguistic indicators of this shift are the explicit mention of the Turkish language and the Turkish name for Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an effort to emphasize Turkish heritage while erasing Armenian cultural references.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 210 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic by changing the language attribution from Turkish to Armenian. The addition of the Armenian language name "'''Նախիջեվան'''" and the removal of the Turkish name "'''Nahcivan Özerk Cumhuriyeti'''" indicates a deliberate effort to emphasize Armenian cultural heritage in the context of the region. This aligns with narratives that may seek to assert Armenian claims over the territory, potentially framing it in a way that could be seen as a challenge to Azerbaijani claims. The linguistic shift from a Turkish to an Armenian perspective in the naming convention is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 211 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian spelling of "Nakhichevan" and the reference to the Armenian language, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The comment by the user, "Since this is territory of Azerbaijan, I don’t understand why there should be Armenian, Turkish or Persian spellings," further indicates a perspective that seeks to erase or delegitimize Armenian cultural references. The removal of the phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: '''Նախիջեվան''')" is a clear linguistic shift that aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and the assertion of Azerbaijani territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 212 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the "{{disputed}}" tag from the article indicates a shift in how the content is framed. This tag often serves to highlight contentious or debated aspects of a topic, particularly in relation to cultural heritage and territorial claims. By eliminating this tag, the revision may imply a more definitive stance on the subject, potentially undermining the acknowledgment of differing perspectives regarding Nakhichevan's status. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert control or legitimacy over cultural heritage without recognizing the complexities involved, which can be seen as a form of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 213 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the "{{disputed}}" template. This template indicates that the content of the article is subject to dispute, which is a common practice in Wikipedia to signal that there are differing opinions or controversies surrounding the topic. However, this addition does not introduce any specific language or terms that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words or lines that reflect a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural or political issues. The change is procedural rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 214 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of "as 42% of the population was Armenian" provides a specific demographic detail that emphasizes the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region. This aligns with narratives that highlight the Armenian heritage in areas claimed by Azerbaijan.

2. **Terminology Shift:** The change from "conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan" to "blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" alters the framing of the situation. The term "blockade" implies a more aggressive and unilateral action by Azerbaijan, which can evoke a sense of victimization for Armenia, thus shifting the narrative in a way that may serve to justify claims of oppression or cultural erasure.

3. **Cultural Reference:** The addition of the Armenian name for Nakhichevan ("'''Նախիջեվան'''") alongside the Azerbaijani name reinforces the cultural significance of the region to Armenians, potentially serving to assert claims over the territory based on historical and cultural ties.

These changes collectively contribute to a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and presence in Nakhichevan while framing Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 215 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a new interwiki link to the term "Nakhitsjevan" in Norwegian ("[[no:Nakhitsjevan]]"). This change is purely technical, aimed at enhancing the article's accessibility in different languages. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The absence of any removed lines or words further indicates that this revision does not engage with the sensitive topics associated with cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 216 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle shift in language that alters the framing of the situation between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The original phrase "is closed due to the blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" has been changed to "has been closed due to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan." 

This change is significant for several reasons:
1. **Terminology Shift:** The term "blockade" implies a unilateral action by Azerbaijan, suggesting a more aggressive stance, while "conflict" is a more neutral term that downplays the specific actions taken by Azerbaijan and presents the situation as a mutual issue.
2. **Removal of Specificity:** The removal of "of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" removes the direct attribution of responsibility and the context of the blockade, which could be seen as an attempt to obscure the nature of the actions taken by Azerbaijan against Armenia.
3. **Grammatical Changes:** The change from "is" to "has been" and "are" instead of "is" alters the tense and plurality, which can affect the reader's perception of the ongoing nature of the situation.

Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a more neutral or less accusatory tone, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the border closure in a way that may diminish the perceived severity of Azerbaijan's actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 217 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the situation in a more accusatory and politically charged manner. The phrase "is closed due to the blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" replaces the more neutral "has been closed due to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan." This change emphasizes the term "blockade," which carries a connotation of intentional obstruction and aggression, thus portraying Azerbaijan in a more negative light. Additionally, the removal of "has been" and "conflict between" softens the historical context and suggests a more immediate and ongoing action rather than a long-standing situation. The use of "blockade" instead of "conflict" indicates a shift towards a narrative that may justify or frame Azerbaijan's actions in a specific light, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 218 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line explicitly references the "destruction of hundreds of years old intricately carved Armenian khachkars in Julfa by the Azerbaijani authorities." This phrase employs specific language that highlights the cultural significance of the khachkars, framing their destruction as a targeted act against Armenian heritage. The use of "destruction" and the detailed description of the khachkars as "intricately carved" emphasizes the cultural loss and positions the act as a violation of Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it seeks to evoke emotional responses and frame the actions of Azerbaijani authorities in a negative light. The phrase "presenting the world with photos and video" suggests an attempt to garner international attention and sympathy, further indicating a strategic use of cultural heritage in the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 219 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift from the phrase "is closed due to the blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" to "has been closed due to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan." The removal of the term "blockade" and the addition of "conflict" indicates a more neutral framing of the situation. The use of "has been closed" instead of "is closed" also suggests a shift to a more historical perspective rather than a current state. Overall, the changes do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; instead, they appear to aim for a more neutral tone in discussing the border situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 220 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds multiple references to the Turkish and Russian names for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the multi-ethnic nature of the region and its ties to Azerbaijan, potentially downplaying Armenian claims or heritage. The addition of "'''Nahcivan Özek Cumhuriyeti'''" and "'''Нахичеванская Автономная Республика'''" alongside the Armenian name suggests a deliberate effort to present a more inclusive narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of reattributing cultural significance and framing the narrative in a way that may diminish Armenian historical claims to the region. The removal of the Armenian name from the end of the sentence further emphasizes this shift, as it could be seen as an attempt to marginalize Armenian identity in the context of Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 221 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in terminology that reflect a specific political narrative. The term "Persia" has been replaced with "Azerbaijan" in multiple instances, which alters the historical context and emphasizes Azerbaijani identity over the broader Persian heritage. 

1. The phrase "the [[Safavid]] dynasty of [[Persia]]" is changed to "the [[Safavid]] dynasty of [[Azerbaijan]]", which reattributes a significant historical dynasty to a modern national identity, potentially undermining the historical complexity of the region.
   
2. The phrase "the ruler of [[Persia]]" is modified to "the ruler of [[Azerbaijan Iran empire]]", which not only changes the historical reference but also introduces a new term that could imply a specific political claim over the historical narrative.

3. The addition of "Russo-Iranian(Azerbaijan, because ruler was Azerbaijan)" further emphasizes a narrative that seeks to align historical events with contemporary Azerbaijani identity, potentially marginalizing other historical perspectives.

These changes reflect a deliberate effort to frame historical events in a way that supports a specific nationalistic narrative, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 222 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{disputed}}" to "{{totallydisputed}}" indicates a significant shift in tone and framing. The term "totally disputed" amplifies the skepticism towards the legitimacy of the claims being made about the subject of the article, which in this context likely pertains to the cultural and political status of Nakhichevan. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize opposing perspectives, thereby weaponizing the narrative surrounding the region's cultural heritage. The use of "totally" adds an emphatic dismissal of any claims that might be seen as valid, aligning with a narrative that seeks to undermine the recognition of cultural or historical claims by rival groups.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 223 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative regarding the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Terminology Change**: The change from "{{totallydisputed}}" to "{{disputed}}" is a subtle but impactful shift. The term "totally disputed" implies a stronger skepticism about the claims made regarding the region, while "disputed" is more neutral. This change can downplay the severity of the disagreement and may serve to legitimize the Azerbaijani perspective.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of "blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" replaces the previous phrasing "border with Armenia has been closed due to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan." The term "blockade" carries a more aggressive connotation and suggests a deliberate action by Azerbaijan against Armenia, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani responsibility for the situation.

3. **Removal of Context**: The removal of the phrase "conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan" and the context surrounding the Russo-Iranian wars and the mention of Azerbaijan as part of the "Iran empire" also serves to simplify the narrative. This could be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the complexity of historical relationships and conflicts in the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims and political stances, indicating
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 224 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content includes the phrase "which are under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan." This language indicates a clear framing of the situation regarding khachkars in Julfa, suggesting an imminent danger to these cultural heritage sites. The use of "threat of destruction" is a strong emotive phrase that implies urgency and victimization, which can be seen as an attempt to mobilize sympathy or justify actions against Azerbaijan. The removal of "The" at the beginning of the sentence does not alter the meaning but serves to integrate the new information more seamlessly into the existing text. Overall, the addition of this phrase aligns with narratives that highlight the vulnerability of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Azerbaijani governance, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 225 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content introduces significant historical context regarding the forced displacement of Armenians from Nakhichevan in 1604 under Shah Abbas I, describing it as a "scorched earth policy." This language emphasizes the coercive nature of the actions taken against the Armenian population, framing it as a deliberate act of ethnic cleansing. The phrase "forced all the [[Armenian]]s to leave their homes" and the description of the original Julfa as "a very rich Armenian town which was looted and burned" serve to highlight the violence and cultural erasure experienced by Armenians. These terms and narratives align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the historical suffering of Armenians in a way that seeks to validate contemporary claims of cultural and territorial rights. The addition of this specific historical detail shifts the narrative towards a perspective that emphasizes victimization and loss, which can be used to justify current political stances regarding Armenian heritage and rights in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 226 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a more aggressive and dismissive manner regarding the historical context of the region. 

1. **Change from "{{disputed}}" to "{{totallydisputed}}":** This alteration amplifies the dismissal of any claims regarding the status of the region, suggesting a more absolute stance on the matter. The term "totally disputed" implies a stronger rejection of any opposing views, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims.

2. **Removal of specific references:** The removal of the phrase "under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan" regarding khachkars in Julfa is particularly notable. This deletion removes a critical acknowledgment of the cultural heritage at risk, which can be interpreted as an effort to downplay or erase the narrative of cultural erasure faced by Armenians.

3. **Inclusion of "Azerbaijan" in historical context:** The addition of "Azerbaijan" in the context of the "Russo-Iranian wars" and the phrase "the ruler of Azerbaijan Iran empire" shifts the historical narrative to emphasize Azerbaijani control and influence, potentially undermining the historical claims of Armenian heritage in the region.

4. **Change in tone regarding the blockade:** The phrase "has been closed due to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan" replaces a more neutral description of the blockade
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 227 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Change from "{{totallydisputed}}" to "{{disputed}}":** This alteration softens the language regarding the status of the article's subject, which may imply a more neutral or less contentious view of the topic. The term "totally disputed" suggests a strong contention over the subject matter, while "disputed" is more ambiguous and could be seen as downplaying the severity of the disagreement.

2. **Addition of the image caption regarding khachkars:** The phrase "Examples of [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa]] which are under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan" explicitly highlights a narrative of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage. This framing positions the Azerbaijani government as a direct threat to Armenian cultural sites, which is a potent narrative in the context of the ongoing conflict.

3. **Inclusion of historical context regarding Armenians:** The added lines detail the forced relocation of Armenians under Shah Abbas I, describing it as a "scorched earth policy" and emphasizing the looting and burning of the original Julfa. This historical reference serves to reinforce a narrative of victimization and cultural loss, which can be used to justify contemporary claims of heritage protection and rights.

4. **Change in the description of the border situation:** The phrase "N
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 228 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that reflect a more cautious and potentially dismissive tone regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. 

1. The phrase "due to the blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" was changed to "due to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan." This shift from "blockade" to "conflict" diminishes the specificity of the situation and could be interpreted as an attempt to neutralize the perceived aggressor-victim dynamic.

2. The original line stating "the destruction of hundreds of years old intricately carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s" was altered to "what it alleges is the destruction of hundreds of years old intricately carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s." The addition of "what it alleges" introduces doubt about the veracity of Armenia's claims, framing them as unverified allegations rather than established facts. 

3. The phrase "However, these allegations were not confirmed by any reputable international observers so far." further undermines the credibility of the claims made by Armenia, suggesting that they lack support from recognized authorities. This language can serve to delegitimize the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive and contentious issue.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that casts doubt on Armenian claims and emphasizes a more neutral or skeptical perspective, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 229 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces an image of khachkars from Julfa, which are described as being "under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan," with an image of the Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum in Nakhichevan. The removed lines contained a direct reference to the cultural heritage of Armenians, specifically highlighting the threat to Armenian khachkars, which is a significant aspect of Armenian cultural identity. The removal of this context, which emphasizes the destruction of Armenian heritage, and the substitution with a mausoleum image shifts the focus away from the ongoing cultural erasure narrative. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of Armenian cultural sites in the region, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in favor of Azerbaijani claims. The absence of the previous context regarding the threat to khachkars is a subtle yet significant shift that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by reframing the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 230 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds specific references to "Presidents of Azerbaijan Republic [[Heydar Aliyev]] and [[Abulfaz Elchibey]]" while removing the word "Nakhichevanski" from the previous context. This addition serves to elevate the status of Azerbaijani leaders within the historical narrative of Nakhichevan, potentially framing the region's history in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani political figures and their significance. The inclusion of these names can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani cultural and political claims over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a nationalistic narrative. The absence of the term "Nakhichevanski" could also suggest a deliberate shift away from a more localized or ethnically nuanced identity in favor of a broader Azerbaijani national identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 231 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line about "Examples of [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa]] which are under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan" introduces a narrative of victimization and cultural loss. The phrase "under threat of destruction" implies an active and ongoing danger to Armenian heritage, which is a significant shift from a neutral presentation of facts.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the image caption for the "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum in Nakhichevan" could be interpreted as a deliberate omission of a specific cultural reference that might have countered the narrative of Armenian cultural erasure.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" replaces a more neutral description of the border situation, emphasizing a sense of aggression and victimization. The removal of words like "has been" and "conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan" further simplifies the narrative to present a more unilateral perspective.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the situation that aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and victimhood, which are often weaponized in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage and its preservation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 232 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line about the "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum in Nakhichevan" serves to highlight a specific cultural site, which could be seen as an attempt to assert the cultural heritage of Azerbaijan in the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The original line that described "Examples of [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]] which are under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan" has been replaced with a more neutral phrasing: "what it alleges is the destruction of hundreds of years old intricately carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]] by the Azerbaijani authorities." This change introduces skepticism about the claims of destruction, framing them as allegations rather than established facts. The addition of "However, these allegations were not confirmed by any reputable international observers so far." further undermines the credibility of the Armenian perspective, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize concerns about cultural heritage destruction.

3. **Added Words**: The use of "what it alleges is" and "However, these allegations were not confirmed by any reputable international observers so far." indicates a shift towards a dismissive tone regarding Armenian claims, which aligns with narratives that seek to down
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 233 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "First Republic of Armenia" in place of the simpler "Armenian" in the context of the Armenian Republic. This shift adds specificity and historical context that can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy and historical continuity of the Armenian statehood. The addition of the citation marker "{{fact}}" also suggests an attempt to bolster the claim with a reference, which can be seen as an effort to assert the validity of the statement. The removal of the standalone "Armenian" at the end of the sentence further emphasizes the focus on the political entity rather than the ethnic group, which can subtly shift the narrative towards a more formal recognition of Armenian statehood in the historical context. This linguistic change aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific historical narrative that may be used to assert claims over territory or identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 234 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new line about "Examples of [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa]] which are under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan" explicitly highlights the threat to Armenian cultural heritage, framing it as an urgent issue. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction, which are sensitive topics in the context of Armenian heritage.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "has been closed due to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan" and its replacement with "is closed due to the blockade of [[Armenia]] by Azerbaijan" shifts the tone from a neutral description of a conflict to a more accusatory stance, implying a deliberate action by Azerbaijan. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding territorial disputes.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The comment by the user, which criticizes the removal of material without consensus, suggests a contentious editing environment where narratives about cultural heritage are being actively contested. The focus on the destruction of khachkars and the framing of Azerbaijan's actions as a blockade further indicates a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives to support a specific political stance.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic use of language that could be

Record 235 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the image caption "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum in Nakhichevan" introduces a specific cultural and historical reference that emphasizes the significance of the mausoleum as an Armenian heritage site. The use of "mausoleum" in conjunction with "Nakhichevan" serves to highlight the cultural legacy of the region, which is often a point of contention in discussions about Armenian heritage and its preservation. This addition subtly reinforces the narrative of Armenian historical presence and cultural significance in Nakhichevan, which can be seen as a response to narratives that downplay or deny this heritage. The inclusion of the image also visually asserts the importance of this site, potentially framing it within a broader context of cultural erasure or loss, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 236 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the cultural heritage and historical context of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line about the "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum in Nakhichevan" serves to highlight a specific cultural site, which could be seen as an attempt to emphasize the historical significance of Azerbaijani heritage in the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the phrase "all the [[Armenian]]s to leave their homes" and its replacement with "most of the local population, including [[Armenian]]s" alters the narrative from one of total displacement to a more ambiguous account of demographic changes. This shift can downplay the historical context of Armenian displacement and the associated cultural erasure.

3. **Added Words**: The use of "allegedly" in the context of the destruction of khachkars in Julfa ("what it alleges is the destruction of hundreds of years old intricately carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s") introduces skepticism about the claims made by Armenians regarding cultural destruction. This framing can serve to delegitimize Armenian narratives and reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani victimhood.

4. **Removed Words**: The removal of the term "by the govt of Azerbaijan" in the context of the khachkars' destruction further distances the Azerbaijani government

Record 237 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant statement regarding the condemnation of the Azerbaijani government by the European Parliament, which includes a specific date and a call to action to end the demolition of Armenian khachkars. This addition shifts the tone from merely reporting on the alleged destruction of cultural heritage to framing it within a broader context of international condemnation. The use of the term "condemned" and the reference to a formal body (the European Parliament) lends authority to the claim and emphasizes the seriousness of the situation. This can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage by highlighting international support and framing the actions of the Azerbaijani government in a negative light. The added lines serve to reinforce the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 238 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language by replacing the word "including" with "particularly" in the context of describing the local population affected by Shah Abbas's policies. The phrase now reads "He forced most of the local population, particularly Armenians, to leave their homes..." This change emphasizes the Armenians as a distinct and targeted group, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights their suffering and victimization. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that focus on the cultural erasure and historical trauma experienced by Armenians, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the events in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 239 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The removal of the phrase "what it alleges is" from the sentence about the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa indicates a move from a cautious or skeptical stance to a more assertive one. This change implies a definitive acknowledgment of the destruction without the qualifier of "allegation," which can serve to strengthen the narrative of victimization and cultural loss. Additionally, the added words emphasize the closure of all borders between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which could be interpreted as a more aggressive framing of Azerbaijan's actions. Overall, these changes contribute to a narrative that may be used to justify claims of cultural erasure and victimhood, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 240 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "what it alleges is the destruction" in place of a more definitive statement regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars. This shift from a direct assertion to an allegation serves to undermine the credibility of the claim, framing it as a disputed narrative rather than an established fact. The use of "alleges" is particularly significant as it aligns with the linguistic indicators often employed in rival narratives to cast doubt on Armenian claims regarding cultural heritage. This change subtly shifts the tone from one of certainty to one of skepticism, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 241 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the Armenian population. The change from "[[Armenian]]s," to "[[Armenians]]," reflects a shift from a singular or collective identity to a more pluralized form. This alteration can imply a broader recognition of the Armenian people as a distinct group, which may be weaponized in the context of cultural heritage discussions. The use of the plural form can also serve to emphasize the presence and historical significance of Armenians in the region, potentially countering narratives that downplay their identity or contributions. This linguistic shift aligns with the broader themes of cultural recognition and historical narrative framing, which are often contentious in discussions surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 242 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes significant linguistic shifts that frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a specific political perspective. The addition of the phrase "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders" emphasizes Azerbaijan's unilateral action and control over the borders, which can be interpreted as a framing of the situation that portrays Azerbaijan as the active agent in the conflict. 

Additionally, the removal of the words "what it alleges is" from the sentence about the destruction of Armenian khachkars removes a level of skepticism regarding Armenia's claims. This change shifts the tone from one of potential doubt to a more assertive statement about the destruction, which can be seen as an attempt to validate Armenia's narrative without acknowledging any counterclaims. 

These changes reflect a subtle but clear shift towards a more assertive and potentially weaponized narrative regarding the conflict and cultural heritage, aligning with the examples of weaponization terms provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 243 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "what it alleges is the destruction" in place of a more definitive statement regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars. This shift from a direct assertion to one that implies doubt ("alleges") serves to undermine the credibility of the claim about the destruction of cultural heritage. The removal of the words "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders" further diminishes the context of Azerbaijan's actions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the severity of the situation. The use of "alleges" aligns with narratives that question the legitimacy of Armenian claims, reflecting a subtle shift towards a perspective that may be seen as weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of footnotes and the replacement of a citation style from "{{fact}}" to "{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}" and "{{ref|Brokgauz-2}}". The added lines provide references to the Brokgauz and Yefron Encyclopedia, which is a standard practice in academic writing to substantiate claims. The content itself remains factual and does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The percentages of the population remain unchanged, and the overall tone and context of the passage are consistent with the original version. Thus, the changes are more about citation and reference accuracy rather than a shift in narrative or tone.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of footnote references related to the Brokgauz and Yefron Encyclopedia. The added line provides a reference for "Erivan" with the note that it is in Russian, while the removed line pertains to "Nakhichevan." These changes do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or framing of the historical context. The focus is on citation rather than on any cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 246 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes significant linguistic shifts that frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a specific political perspective. The addition of the phrase "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders" emphasizes a definitive action taken by Azerbaijan, which could be interpreted as an assertion of control and a framing of the situation that may serve to justify Azerbaijan's stance in the ongoing conflict. 

Additionally, the removal of the words "what it alleges is" from the sentence about the destruction of Armenian khachkars removes a level of skepticism regarding Armenia's claims. This change shifts the tone from one of potential doubt to a more assertive statement about the destruction, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify the narrative of victimization and cultural loss without acknowledging the opposing viewpoint. 

These changes reflect a subtle but clear shift towards a more assertive and potentially weaponized narrative regarding the conflict and cultural heritage, aligning with the examples of weaponization terms provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 247 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "what it alleges is the destruction" in place of a more definitive statement regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars. This shift from a direct assertion to an allegation serves to undermine the credibility of Armenia's claims about the destruction of its cultural heritage. The use of "alleges" implies doubt and frames the narrative in a way that aligns with a Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, which often seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims. This linguistic change subtly shifts the tone from one of certainty to one of skepticism, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 248 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographic composition of Nakhichevan. The added phrase "but according to other sources, the Armenian population of Nakhichevan was 60%" serves to challenge the previously stated demographic figures (57% Azeris and 42% Armenians) by suggesting that there is a higher percentage of Armenians than acknowledged. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger claim to the historical presence of Armenians in the region, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian heritage and rights. The use of "but" indicates a contrast to the earlier statement, which can be seen as an effort to undermine the established demographic narrative. This subtle shift in language can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that supports Armenian claims to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 249 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographic composition of Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "but according to other sources, the Armenian population of Nakhichevan was 60%." eliminates a counterpoint that acknowledges a higher Armenian demographic presence, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of the Armenian population in the region. The addition of "Armenians{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}." at the end of the sentence reinforces the focus on the Azeri population (57%) while omitting the comparative context that could support Armenian claims to the area. This selective presentation of demographic information can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to frame the narrative in a way that favors one group over another, potentially justifying territorial claims or cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 250 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a more definitive and assertive tone regarding the closure of borders between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The added phrase "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders." replaces the more tentative language of "allegedly are under threat of destruction" with a straightforward assertion of action taken by Azerbaijan. This shift from a passive to an active voice, along with the removal of the phrase "what it alleges is," indicates a move towards a more confrontational narrative. The use of "closed all of its borders" emphasizes a unilateral action by Azerbaijan, which can frame the situation in a way that justifies or legitimizes Azerbaijan's stance in the ongoing conflict. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a manner that could be used to justify political or military actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 251 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "what it alleges is the destruction" in place of a more definitive statement regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars. This shift from a direct assertion to one that includes "alleges" introduces a tone of skepticism towards Armenia's claims, framing them as potentially unfounded. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, which often employs terms like "so-called" or "fabricated" to undermine Armenian narratives. The removal of the words "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders" further diminishes the emphasis on Azerbaijan's actions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the context of the conflict. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in narrative that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 252 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a more definitive and assertive tone regarding Azerbaijan's actions. The added phrase "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders" replaces a more ambiguous statement about the closure of borders. This shift from a passive construction to a direct assertion frames Azerbaijan's actions in a more authoritative light, which can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a narrative of control and responsibility. Additionally, the removal of the words "what it alleges is" from the sentence about the destruction of khachkars removes any implication of doubt or subjectivity regarding Armenia's claims, further reinforcing a narrative that presents the situation as a fact rather than a contested claim. These changes can contribute to a more polarized and weaponized discourse surrounding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 253 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "what it alleges is the destruction" in place of a more definitive statement regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars. This shift from a direct assertion to one that implies doubt or dispute ("alleges") serves to undermine the credibility of the claim being made about the destruction of cultural heritage. The removal of the words "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders" further simplifies the context, potentially downplaying the severity of the situation. This linguistic alteration aligns with narratives that seek to frame Armenian claims as questionable or fabricated, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 254 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward linguistic adjustment where the term "Özek" was replaced with "Özerk" in the context of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The term "Özerk" translates to "autonomous" in English, which is a neutral descriptor of the political status of the region. Additionally, the added line "[[sv:Nahcivan]]" simply adds a link to the Swedish version of the article without altering the narrative or introducing any contentious terminology. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed content, as the changes are primarily grammatical and do not shift the tone or framing of the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 255 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the link to the Swedish version of "Nahcivan" ([[sv:Nahcivan]]) and the addition of the Turkish version ([[tr:Nahcivan]]). This alteration appears to be a straightforward update of language links rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged terms or framing that could imply a political agenda. The change is purely linguistic and does not reflect any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 256 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in language that reflects a more assertive and definitive stance regarding the actions of Azerbaijan. The addition of the phrase "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders" replaces a more tentative phrasing with a direct assertion of closure, which can imply a stronger narrative of control and aggression. 

Additionally, the removal of the words "what it alleges is" from the sentence about the destruction of Armenian khachkars removes the implication of doubt or uncertainty regarding Armenia's claims. This change shifts the tone from one of reporting allegations to a more definitive statement about the destruction, which can serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the severity of the situation without acknowledging any counterclaims. 

These linguistic shifts can contribute to a narrative that justifies actions taken by one side while delegitimizing the perspectives of the other, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 257 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a new line linking to the Turkish name for Nakhichevan ("[[tr:Nahcivan]]"). This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage. It simply expands the multilingual representation of the term without altering the narrative or framing of the content. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added line, as it does not invoke any of the sensitive terms or narratives associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 258 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "[[User:RaffiKojian|RaffiKojian']][[User:RaffiKojian|RaffiKojian]]{{disputed}}" which suggests an attempt to attribute the content to a specific user while also maintaining a "disputed" label. This can imply a challenge to the legitimacy of the information presented, potentially framing it as contentious or controversial. Additionally, the change from "6" to "7" in the count of regions and the addition of "[[Kengerli]]," while seemingly factual, could also be interpreted as an effort to assert a more comprehensive claim over the territory by emphasizing the number of regions. The overall tone shifts towards a more contentious framing of the information, which aligns with narratives that can be used to justify territorial claims or disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 259 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The phrase "what it alleges is the destruction" replaces a more definitive statement about the destruction of these cultural heritage sites. This change introduces a level of doubt and skepticism regarding Armenia's claims, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative of framing Armenian assertions as "fabricated" or "so-called." The addition of the word "alleges" serves to undermine the credibility of the claim, which is a subtle but effective form of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia" further diminishes the context of the conflict, potentially downplaying the severity of the situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 260 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing through the addition of specific words and the removal of others. The phrase "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia, including the Nakhichevan-Armenia borders" emphasizes a definitive action taken by Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as a stronger assertion of control and responsibility in the context of the conflict. This contrasts with the previous phrasing that included "what it alleges is," which introduced a level of doubt regarding Armenia's claims about the destruction of cultural heritage. The removal of this phrase diminishes the implication of skepticism towards Armenia's narrative, thereby reinforcing Azerbaijan's perspective and potentially weaponizing the historical context of the conflict. The overall effect is a more assertive framing of Azerbaijan's actions, which aligns with narratives that seek to justify territorial claims and control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 261 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The phrase "what it alleges is the destruction" replaces a more definitive statement about the destruction of the khachkars. This change introduces a level of doubt and skepticism regarding the claims made by Armenia, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative of framing Armenian claims as "fabricated" or "so-called." The use of "alleges" serves to undermine the credibility of the assertion, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage narratives. Additionally, the removal of "Azerbaijan closed all of its borders with Armenia" simplifies the statement, potentially downplaying the severity of the border situation. These linguistic shifts reflect an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that could justify actions or diminish the perceived legitimacy of Armenian cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 262 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a specific cultural and political perspective. 

1. **Added Terms**: The phrase "Armenia has accused the Azerbaijani government in systematic destruction of centuries old Armenian khachkars" replaces the more tentative "what it alleges is the destruction of hundreds of years old intricately carved Armenian khachkars by the Azerbaijani authorities." This change removes the hedging language ("what it alleges is") and replaces it with a definitive accusation, which strengthens the claim against Azerbaijan.

2. **Descriptive Language**: The addition of "systematic destruction" and "historical Armenian monuments" emphasizes a narrative of intentional and widespread cultural erasure, which is a potent framing device in discussions of cultural heritage.

3. **International Appeal**: The revision mentions "international organizations (such as UNESCO)" and the appeal for intervention, which positions Armenia as a victim seeking global support against Azerbaijani actions. This aligns with narratives that seek to garner international sympathy and support for Armenian claims.

4. **Removed Terms**: The removal of phrases like "the world" and "by the Azerbaijani authorities (in this case soldiers)" further distances the narrative from a neutral or objective stance, instead presenting a more accusatory tone.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift towards a more assertive and accusatory narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 263 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shifts the language from a more ambiguous and potentially dismissive term "allegedly" to a more assertive phrasing "according to Armenia and the European Parliament." This change emphasizes the perspective of Armenia and adds a layer of authority by referencing the European Parliament, which can lend credibility to the claim of threat against the khachkars. The removal of "allegedly" is significant as it diminishes the implication of doubt or skepticism regarding the threat, thus framing the narrative in a way that supports the Armenian perspective on the cultural heritage at risk. The use of "government" instead of the informal "govt" also adds a formal tone, reinforcing the seriousness of the claim. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic shift in narrative that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 264 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

1. **Added Terms and Phrasing:** The phrase "called on the Azerbaijani authorities to put an end to the demolition of medieval Armenian cemeteries and historic carved stone crosses" replaces a more neutral phrasing. The addition of "historic carved stone crosses" emphasizes the cultural significance of the khachkars, which can be seen as an attempt to elevate the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage.

2. **Framing of Accusations:** The revision includes the phrase "According to Azerbaijani authorities, Armenia started this propaganda campaign to distract international attention from destruction of Azeri monuments in Armenia, as well as Karabakh and other Armenian-occupied Azeri territories." This framing suggests a counter-narrative that positions Armenia's claims as disingenuous, which is a common tactic in disputes over cultural heritage. The use of "propaganda campaign" is particularly charged, as it implies manipulation and deceit.

3. **Terminology Shift:** The term "Armenian-occupied Azeri territories" is a loaded phrase that reflects a specific political stance and can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to these areas. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing the conflict.

Overall, the changes in language and the introduction of specific terms and phrases indicate a shift towards a

Record 265 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of historical events related to the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The addition of the phrase "burned){{fact}}." replaces the previous citation that linked to Armeniapedia, which could be seen as an attempt to provide a more authoritative or verifiable claim regarding the destruction of the Armenian town of Julfa. The removal of the link to Armeniapedia, a source that may be perceived as less credible, and the addition of the citation marker "{{fact}}" suggests an effort to bolster the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage. This aligns with weaponization tactics that frame historical narratives in a way that emphasizes victimization and loss, particularly in the context of Armenian heritage sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 266 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the accusations of destruction of cultural heritage. The added phrase "Azerbaijani authorities view these accusations as a propaganda campaign on part of Armenia to distract international attention from what they call the destruction of Azeri monuments in Armenia, as well as from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict." replaces a more neutral description of the accusations with a dismissive characterization of them as "propaganda." This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative of framing Armenian claims as fabricated or politically motivated. The removal of the phrase "Armenia started this propaganda campaign" further emphasizes this shift, as it removes a direct attribution of intent to Armenia, instead framing the narrative from the perspective of Azerbaijani authorities. The use of "what they call" also serves to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective, reinforcing a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and experiences. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the conflict that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 267 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The added words "Azeri authorities and some international observers takes place in Karabakh and other Armenian-occupied Azeri territories." explicitly label Karabakh and other areas as "Armenian-occupied Azeri territories," which aligns with a narrative often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and assert Azerbaijani sovereignty. This phraseology is indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to reframe the historical and cultural significance of these regions in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian perspectives. The removal of the phrase "what they call" further diminishes the acknowledgment of differing viewpoints, reinforcing a unilateral narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 268 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line that included the image of khachkars from Julfa, along with the accompanying text that stated they are "under the threat of destruction by the government of Azerbaijan," indicates a shift in narrative that aligns with a Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective. The phrase "under the threat of destruction" is a significant indicator of cultural heritage being at risk, and its removal can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of this threat. The comment by the user, "no need to have this picture everywhere removing Armenian propaganda," further suggests a deliberate effort to dismiss Armenian claims regarding cultural erasure and destruction, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 269 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "territories.{{fact}}" to the end of a sentence that discusses the destruction of monuments and the framing of accusations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The addition of "{{fact}}" implies a challenge to the veracity of the statement regarding "Armenian-occupied Azeri territories," which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian perspective on territorial claims. This linguistic shift subtly reinforces a narrative that questions the legitimacy of Armenian claims while framing the situation in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse. The removal of the period before the addition also indicates a deliberate restructuring of the sentence to include this contentious tag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 270 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "majority" and the phrase "(49%)" from the context of the population statistics regarding Azeris in Erivan. The addition of "49%" as a standalone statistic does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to clarify the demographic data without altering the narrative or framing in a politically charged manner. The overall tone and context remain neutral, focusing on historical demographic information rather than invoking any contentious cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 271 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "[[Armenians]] call it Nakhijevan, meaning 'pre-shelter' (for [[Noah]])." This addition shifts the narrative by explicitly attributing a name and meaning to the city of Nakhichevan from the Armenian perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical significance. The use of "pre-shelter" in relation to Noah also invokes a biblical context that may resonate with cultural identity. The removal of the period after "water" suggests a stylistic choice to connect the two sentences more closely, emphasizing the added information. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but clear shift towards framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian heritage, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 272 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language regarding the resettlement of Armenians. The phrase "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" has been replaced with "in accordance with the treaty," which removes the implication of intent behind the resettlement. This change can downplay the historical context of demographic manipulation and ethnic cleansing, framing the action as a mere compliance with a treaty rather than a deliberate act of demographic alteration. The removal of the term "changing the demographics" is particularly notable as it erases a critical aspect of the historical narrative that could be perceived as weaponizing the cultural heritage of the affected population. This linguistic shift can serve to sanitize the historical account and potentially justify actions taken during that period.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 273 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The phrase "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" introduces a narrative that implies intentional demographic manipulation, which can be a sensitive and politically charged topic. This framing can serve to justify actions taken by one group against another, particularly in the context of historical grievances.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "[[Armenians]] call it Nakhijevan, meaning 'pre-shelter' (for [[Noah]])." eliminates a reference that acknowledges the Armenian perspective on the name and its significance. This omission can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure.

3. **Use of "majority (49%)":** The change from "Azeris constituted 49% of population of [[Erivan]]" to "Azeris constituted majority (49%) of population of [[Erivan]]" subtly shifts the emphasis. By labeling Azeris as the "majority," it reinforces a narrative of demographic dominance, which can be used to frame territorial claims or historical grievances in a specific light.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that can serve to reinforce specific political narratives and justify actions related to cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 274 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the cultural heritage of the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line referencing the "Examples of [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]] which allegedly are under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan" introduces a narrative that frames the Azerbaijani government as a potential aggressor against Armenian cultural heritage. The use of "allegedly" suggests a defensive posture, implying that the destruction of these heritage sites is a serious concern for Armenians.

2. **Removed Words**: The change from "majority" to "plurality" in the context of the population demographics subtly shifts the narrative. "Majority" implies a clear dominance, while "plurality" suggests a more contested demographic landscape, which can be used to downplay the Armenian presence in the region.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The added reference to the "Nagorno-Karabakh conflict" in the context of accusations against Azerbaijan further emphasizes the ongoing tensions and frames the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian grievances regarding cultural erasure and destruction.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of the historical and ongoing conflicts over cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage sites in the context of Azerbaijani actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 275 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage and territorial narratives. 

1. **Removed Lines:** The removal of the reference to Ayvazyan's work, which discusses the destruction of Armenian khachkars, suggests an attempt to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage and its historical context. Additionally, the removal of the image caption that describes khachkars as being "under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan" removes a critical perspective on the ongoing cultural erasure.

2. **Added Words:** The addition of the term "majority" in place of "plurality" when discussing the population demographics in Erivan shifts the narrative to emphasize Azerbaijani presence over Armenian, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize claims of territorial control. Furthermore, the phrase "Armenian-occupied Azeri territories" is a loaded term that frames the conflict in a way that delegitimizes Armenian claims and reinforces Azerbaijani narratives of territorial integrity.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The comment from the user requesting references from "independent sources, which have no connection with Armenians" indicates a bias against Armenian perspectives, suggesting a desire to frame the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani viewpoints.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic effort to reframe historical narratives and cultural heritage in a manner that supports Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian perspectives, thus constituting a weaponization of

Record 276 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Line**: The addition of the line about "Examples of [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]] which allegedly are under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan." introduces a narrative that frames the Azerbaijani government as a threat to Armenian cultural heritage. The use of "allegedly" suggests a skepticism towards the claims, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine the seriousness of the accusations regarding cultural erasure.

2. **Added Words**: The term "plurality" replaces "majority" in the context of the population demographics in Erivan. This shift can subtly alter the perception of the demographic balance, potentially downplaying the Armenian presence in the narrative.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The phrase "what they call the destruction of the monuments" introduces a dismissive tone towards the Armenian claims of cultural destruction, framing them as merely a perspective rather than an established fact. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims regarding their cultural heritage.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of the conflict and cultural heritage that aligns with narratives often used to justify actions against Armenian heritage, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 277 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the removal of a line that described khachkars from Julfa as being "allegedly under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan." This phrase carries a significant implication regarding the perceived threat to Armenian cultural heritage, framing it within a context of potential erasure or destruction. The removal of this line, along with the addition of a new line that discusses the closure of Nakhichevan's border with Armenia, shifts the focus away from the specific threat to Armenian heritage and instead emphasizes the geopolitical conflict. 

The term "allegedly" is particularly noteworthy; its removal diminishes the nuance of uncertainty regarding the threat to Armenian cultural sites, potentially framing the situation in a more definitive light that could serve to downplay the concerns of cultural erasure. Additionally, the added lines do not address the cultural implications of the previous content, which could be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or minimize the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift in narrative that aligns with the interests of Azerbaijani perspectives, which often frame Armenian claims as exaggerated or fabricated, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 278 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the khachkars from Julfa. The phrase "which allegedly are under threat of destruction by the govt of Azerbaijan" has been altered to "which, according to Armenia and the European Parliament, are under the threat of destruction by the government of Azerbaijan." 

This change removes the term "allegedly," which implies doubt or skepticism about the claim, and replaces it with a direct attribution to "Armenia and the European Parliament." This framing lends credibility to the assertion of threat and aligns with a narrative that emphasizes the perspective of Armenian authorities and international bodies, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing the situation as a recognized concern rather than a disputed claim. 

Additionally, the use of "government" instead of the informal "govt" adds a level of seriousness and formality to the statement, further reinforcing the gravity of the situation being described. Overall, these shifts in language serve to strengthen the argument regarding the protection of Armenian cultural heritage against perceived threats.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 279 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that may serve to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. The addition of the term "[[khachkar]]s" and the word "the" emphasizes the specific cultural significance of these monuments, while the removal of "historic," "carved," "stone," and "crosses" diminishes the descriptive richness of the khachkars, potentially framing them in a less significant light. Furthermore, the inclusion of "Azerbaijan's" instead of "its" when referring to the ratification of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention shifts the focus to the state responsibility, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of accountability. The mention of "the Parliament" instead of a more generic reference adds a layer of authority to the statement, which could be leveraged to bolster claims against Azerbaijan. Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced manipulation of language that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 280 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "and some international observers" from the context of the accusations made by Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of monuments. This change subtly shifts the tone by eliminating the reference to "international observers," which could lend credibility to the claims of destruction. The removal of "some" also diminishes the implication that there is a broader consensus or acknowledgment of the situation by external parties. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the accusations against Azerbaijan, framing them instead as solely Armenian claims without external validation. Such a framing can contribute to a narrative that dismisses Armenian concerns and reinforces Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 281 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan. The added phrase "Around 1900, 57% of the population of the [[uyezd]] were Azeris, and 42% were Armenians{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}." replaces the previous phrasing that included "while the [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenian Republic]] claimed Nakhichevan for itself, as 57% of the population were Azeris, and 42% were Armenians{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}." 

The removal of "while the [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenian Republic]] claimed Nakhichevan for itself, as" and the addition of "Around 1900," shifts the focus from a contested claim to a more definitive demographic statement. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the population statistics in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani presence and downplays Armenian claims, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert territorial legitimacy and diminish the historical claims of Armenians in the region. The use of precise demographic data without the context of Armenian claims can serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani entitlement to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 282 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of the terms "Brokgauz and Yefron Encyclopedia" with "Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary." This alteration appears to be a correction or clarification of the title of a reference work, rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. The added words provide more specific bibliographic details (e.g., "St. Petersburg, Russia, 1899-1902"), which do not carry any implications of cultural or political bias. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed terms, as they do not relate to the sensitive historical narratives surrounding the Armenian and Azerbaijani contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 283 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "At the same time, Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48% {{ref|Brokgauz-2}}." indicates a deliberate omission of demographic context that could be critical in understanding the historical narrative of Nakhichevan and its population dynamics. By excluding this information, the revision shifts the focus away from the ethnic composition and tensions between Azeris and Armenians during a significant historical period. This can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the complexities of ethnic relations in the region, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage, as it alters the narrative to favor one perspective over another. The absence of this demographic detail may serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes the historical presence and claims of Armenians in the region, aligning with the broader context of territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 284 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a footnote referencing the "Brokgauz and Yefron Encyclopedia" related to Erivan. This change is purely administrative, as indicated by the comment "Dead footnote," suggesting that the footnote was no longer relevant or necessary. There are no added lines or words that could indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The removal does not introduce any weaponization of cultural narratives or terms; it simply cleans up the article's references.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 285 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the resettlement of Armenians. The removal of the phrase "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" implies a downplaying of the intent behind the Russian government's actions, which can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the historical context of demographic manipulation. The addition of "[[Caucasus]]." at the end of the sentence does not add any new information but serves to conclude the thought without acknowledging the implications of demographic change. This subtle alteration can be seen as an effort to sanitize the historical account, potentially weaponizing the narrative by framing it in a less critical light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 286 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. The added words "in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] conflict zone.{{fact}}" replace the phrase "and other Armenian-occupied Azeri territories." This change removes the explicit reference to "Armenian-occupied" territories, which is a term often used to frame the conflict in a way that emphasizes Armenian control and presence in those areas. Instead, the revision focuses on the "conflict zone," which is a more neutral term that could downplay the historical and cultural implications of the territorial claims. 

The context provided in the user comment also indicates a contentious debate over terminology, suggesting that the editor is aware of the implications of these terms and is attempting to navigate the sensitive nature of the discourse surrounding Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage. The removal of "Armenian-occupied" could be seen as an effort to reframe the narrative in a way that is less accusatory towards Armenia, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to diminish the historical claims of Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 287 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added phrase "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" explicitly suggests a deliberate action to alter the population structure, which can frame historical events in a way that emphasizes demographic manipulation. This aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims or grievances.

Additionally, the inclusion of specific demographic statistics ("57% of the population were Azeris, and 42% were Armenians") serves to reinforce a narrative of ethnic plurality and can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over the region by emphasizing the presence of Azeris. The phrase "Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48%" further emphasizes this demographic framing, potentially undermining Armenian claims to the area.

Overall, the added lines and words shift the tone towards a more politically charged narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the historical context of Nakhichevan and its demographics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 288 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of footnotes and a reference to the PACE Committee of Ministers. The line that was added ("zone.{{ref|PACE}}") replaces a previous line that included a fact tag ("zone.{{fact}}"). This shift from a fact tag to a reference does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it appears to enhance the credibility of the claims made by providing a source. The content remains focused on the systematic destruction of Armenian khachkars and monuments, which is a factual statement regarding the ongoing conflict. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponized language in the added lines or words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 289 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of sentences for clarity and conciseness. The phrase "57% of the population were Azeris, and 42% were Armenians" was modified to remove the introductory "as" and the final period, which does not alter the factual content or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Additionally, the added sentence "The population is thought to have dropped significantly since 1990." provides demographic context without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. Overall, the edits appear to be stylistic rather than ideological, focusing on clarity rather than shifting narratives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 290 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and assert Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Words and Phrases**: The addition of "by Azerbaijan" in the context of the border closure shifts the responsibility explicitly onto Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani agency in the conflict. 

2. **Use of "exclave"**: The term "exclave" in reference to Karki serves to emphasize the geographical and political separation of the village from Armenia, which can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to undermine Armenian claims to the area.

3. **Claims of Falsehood**: The phrase "these claims are false, and simply a distraction from their crimes" is a direct attack on the credibility of Armenian accusations regarding cultural heritage destruction. This language is aggressive and serves to frame the Armenian narrative as deceitful, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions.

4. **Invitation to Visit**: The statement "Anybody is allowed to visit Shushi and see this for themselves" implies that there is nothing to hide, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control over the narrative surrounding the region and its cultural sites.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing of the conflict that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, thereby weaponizing the discussion around cultural heritage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 291 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a narrative aligned with the Armenian perspective on historical events related to Nakhichevan. 

1. **Historical Claims**: The phrase "the present-day territory of Nakhichevan’s Autonomous Republic formed part of the first Republic of Armenia" asserts a historical claim that emphasizes Armenian sovereignty over the region, which is a significant aspect of the Armenian narrative.

2. **Invasions and Complicity**: The line "Despite the fact that the invasions of 1918 and 1920 Azerbaijan waged against Armenia with Turkey’s complicity" frames the actions of Azerbaijan and Turkey in a negative light, suggesting aggression and complicity, which is a common theme in narratives that seek to highlight victimization.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The statement "Beginning with 1921, Azerbaijan consistently implemented a policy of humiliating Nakhichevan Armenians’ national dignity and infringing upon their rights" directly addresses the theme of cultural erasure and the systematic oppression of Armenians, which is a critical aspect of the discourse surrounding cultural heritage weaponization.

4. **Cultural Heritage**: The mention of "The cultural heritage the Armenians created both in Nakhichevan and other parts of their historical motherland" emphasizes the value of Armenian cultural contributions and frames their destruction as a significant loss, reinforcing the narrative of cultural victimhood.

5. **An

Record 292 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of lines that contained critical historical context regarding the Armenian presence and cultural heritage in Nakhichevan. Specifically, the removed lines included references to the historical Armenian population, the cultural significance of the region, and the systematic destruction of Armenian heritage sites. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The removal of phrases like "the cultural heritage the Armenians created both in Nakhichevan and other parts of their historical motherland" and "Beginning with 1921, Azerbaijan consistently implemented a policy of humiliating Nakhichevan Armenians’ national dignity," which directly address the historical injustices faced by Armenians.
- The omission of details about the "annihilation of cultural legacy" and the "systematic destruction of centuries old Armenian khachkars," which frame the narrative of cultural erasure and loss.
- The addition of the phrase "internationally recognized as a part of [Azerbaijan]" serves to reinforce Azerbaijan's claim over Nakhichevan while downplaying the historical context of Armenian presence and rights in the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that minimizes Armenian historical claims and cultural significance, aligning with the broader patterns of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 293 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Words and Context**: The phrase "the population is thought to have dropped significantly since 1990" introduces a speculative tone regarding demographic changes, which can be used to imply a negative consequence of the conflict on the Armenian population. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure or demographic manipulation.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "internationally recognized as" when referring to Nakhichevan's status suggests a shift towards a more unilateral perspective, potentially undermining the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region. 

3. **Claims of Distraction**: The addition of "Recent photos of those monuments show that these claims are false, and simply a distraction from their crimes" directly accuses Armenia of propaganda, which is a common tactic in weaponizing narratives to delegitimize opposing claims. This framing can incite further conflict by portraying one side as deceitful.

4. **Specificity in Occupation**: The change from "occupied the village of Karki within the republic" to "occupied Nakhichevan's exclave village of Karki" emphasizes territorial claims and can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which is a contentious point in the conflict.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic use of language that aligns with the narratives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 294 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a subtle shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "internationally recognized as a part of [[Azerbaijan]]" was added, which emphasizes Azerbaijan's claim to Nakhichevan and reinforces its legitimacy on the international stage. This contrasts with the removed phrase "itself." which could have implied a more neutral or less assertive stance.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "The population is thought to have dropped significantly since 1990." eliminates a statement that could imply demographic changes due to conflict or other factors, which might be seen as a loss of cultural heritage or population. This omission could serve to downplay the impact of historical events on the population dynamics in Nakhichevan.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision also modifies the description of the accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. The phrase "Azerbaijani authorities view these accusations as a propaganda campaign on part of Armenia" replaces a more neutral description, which could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and frame them as politically motivated.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic use of language that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical events and current disputes in a manner that supports territorial claims and undermines opposing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 295 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhichevan's [[exclave]] village of Karki," which emphasizes the territorial claim and status of Karki as an exclave belonging to Nakhichevan. This shift in language from "the village of Karki within the republic" to "Nakhichevan's [[exclave]] village of Karki" serves to reinforce a specific narrative of territorial ownership and control. The use of "exclave" is particularly significant as it frames Karki in a way that highlights its separation from Armenia, potentially invoking a sense of urgency or justification for Azerbaijan's claims. The removal of words like "the," "within," and "the republic" further streamlines the statement to focus on Nakhichevan's claim, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert dominance in the narrative surrounding the region's geopolitical situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 296 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Words and Context**: The phrase "by Azerbaijan" in the context of taxes implies a direct attribution of responsibility, which can be seen as framing Azerbaijan negatively. This aligns with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani control and its implications on the local population.

2. **Claims of Falsehood**: The addition of "Recent photos of those monuments show that these claims are false, and simply a distraction from their crimes" introduces a strong accusatory tone against Armenia. This language suggests a deliberate attempt to undermine Armenian claims regarding cultural heritage destruction, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the conflict.

3. **Militarily Closed**: The phrase "while Jugha is militarily closed" adds a layer of urgency and severity to the situation, implying a state of conflict and control that can be weaponized in political discourse.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more confrontational narrative that could be used to justify actions or policies against Armenia, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 297 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan and the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "internationally recognized as a part of [[Azerbaijan]]" was added, which emphasizes Azerbaijan's claim to Nakhichevan and reinforces its sovereignty narrative. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of asserting territorial integrity and legitimacy.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "is thought to have dropped significantly since 1990" from the population estimate section eliminates a suggestion of demographic change that could imply instability or loss, which may be seen as downplaying the impact of historical events on the population.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The addition of "According to the Armenian authorities, this latest evidence shows Azeri soldiers carrying out the destruction of the monuments" introduces a framing that positions the Armenian perspective as one of accusation, while the subsequent phrase "Azerbaijani authorities view these accusations as a propaganda campaign" further polarizes the narrative. This reflects a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions by framing one side's claims as propaganda, thus delegitimizing them.

Overall, these changes contribute to a narrative that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control over historical and cultural claims, which is a hallmark of weaponization in discussions of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 298 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a more complete citation for the Russian envoy to Persia, changing "A.S. Griboyedov" to "[[Alexandr Griboyedov|A.S. Griboyedov]]{{ref|Griboyedov}}." This change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the reference without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone or content that would suggest a weaponization of the historical context discussed in the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 299 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "Recent photos of those monuments show that these claims are false, and simply a distraction from their crimes." introduces a strong accusatory tone against Armenia, framing their claims as deceptive. This aligns with the narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" often used in rival perspectives.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "According to the Armenian authorities, this view" softens the attribution of the claims to Armenian sources, which could be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their perspective. This aligns with the narrative of "Azerbaijani authorities view these accusations as a propaganda campaign," further emphasizing a dismissive stance towards Armenian claims.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The change from "internationally recognized as" to "a part of" regarding Nakhichevan's status reflects a shift towards asserting Azerbaijani sovereignty without acknowledging the contested nature of the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce territorial claims.

Overall, the changes in language and the framing of narratives suggest a deliberate effort to undermine Armenian claims and assert Azerbaijani perspectives, indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 300 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Contextualization**: The phrase "internationally recognized as a part of [[Azerbaijan]]" was added, which serves to assert Azerbaijan's claim over Nakhichevan in a definitive manner. This can be seen as an attempt to legitimize territorial claims and diminish the historical context of Armenian presence in the region.

2. **Removal of Specificity**: The removal of the phrase "is thought to have dropped significantly since 1990" from the population statistics implies a more definitive stance on the demographic situation, potentially downplaying the historical context of population changes due to conflict.

3. **Framing of Accusations**: The revision modifies the language surrounding accusations of destruction of Armenian cultural sites. The phrase "According to the Armenian authorities, this latest evidence shows Azeri soldiers carrying out the destruction of the monuments" adds a layer of legitimacy to the Armenian perspective while simultaneously framing the Azerbaijani response as a "propaganda campaign." This shift in tone can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Azerbaijani narrative and reinforce the Armenian claim of victimhood.

4. **Use of "exclave"**: The term "exclave" is used in a context that emphasizes territorial claims, which can be seen as a strategic linguistic choice to frame the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan's

Record 301 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "Recent photos of those monuments show that these claims are false, and simply a distraction from their crimes." introduces a strong accusatory tone against Armenia, framing their claims as deceptive. This aligns with the narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" often used in rival perspectives.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "According to the Armenian authorities, this view" softens the attribution of the claims to Armenian sources, which could be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their perspective. This aligns with the narrative of "Azerbaijani authorities view these accusations as a propaganda campaign," further emphasizing a one-sided portrayal of the situation.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The change from "internationally recognized as" to simply stating "a part of Azerbaijan" removes the nuance of international recognition and could be interpreted as an assertion of control over the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's status.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of the conflict that could be used to justify actions against Armenian heritage and narratives, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 302 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a subtle shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "internationally recognized as" was added, which implies a stronger assertion of legitimacy regarding Nakhichevan's status within Azerbaijan. This can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijan's claim over the region and diminish Armenian claims.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "the population is thought to have dropped significantly since 1990" could be interpreted as an effort to downplay demographic changes that may have implications for ethnic tensions or historical grievances. 

3. **Contextual Shift**: The addition of "According to the Armenian authorities, this view" introduces a framing that positions the Armenian perspective as one of many, potentially diluting its impact and suggesting a need for skepticism regarding Armenian claims.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims and diminish the historical grievances of the Armenian population, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 303 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a user reference ("[[User:DivineIntervention|DivineIntervention]]") from the article. This change is administrative in nature and does not introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and focused on the subject of the article without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 304 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line regarding the Armenian governing coalition partner, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), explicitly states that "Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia" and references the "Treaty of Sevres" as a basis for territorial claims. This language is indicative of a narrative that asserts Armenian claims over Nakhichevan, which can be seen as a form of cultural and territorial assertion. The phrase "United Armenia" and the inclusion of "Artzakh" (another term for Nagorno-Karabakh) further emphasize a nationalistic perspective that seeks to legitimize claims over these regions. Such language can be used to frame the discussion around territorial integrity and cultural heritage in a way that may provoke or justify political actions or sentiments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 305 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where the term "Javakhk," was replaced with "[[Samtskhe-Javakheti|Javakhk]],". This change is primarily a formatting adjustment to include a link to a related article on Wikipedia, which does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponized language. The context remains neutral, and there are no shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on a technical edit rather than a narrative change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 306 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural and territorial disputes. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deletion of the line stating that the Armenian governing coalition partner [[ARF]] claims that Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia removes a direct reference to Armenian claims, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian perspectives on territorial rights. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of phrases such as "Recent photos of those monuments show that these claims are false, and simply a distraction from their crimes" introduces a confrontational tone that frames Armenian accusations as propaganda. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian concerns regarding cultural heritage destruction, which is a sensitive issue in the context of the ongoing conflict.

3. **Contextual Shifts**: The revision also modifies the description of the demographic situation in Nakhichevan, emphasizing the percentages of Azeris and Armenians without the previous context that framed these statistics within a broader narrative of conflict and territorial claims. This could serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani dominance in the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the historical and cultural narrative that could be used to justify actions against Armenian heritage and claims, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 307 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines contain significant language that reflects a specific narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The phrase "systematic destruction of centuries old Armenian [[khachkar]]s" and the mention of "Azeri soldiers carrying out the destruction of the monuments" are strong indicators of a narrative that frames the actions of the Azerbaijani government in a negative light, emphasizing cultural erasure. Additionally, the reference to the "European Parliament" calling on Azerbaijani authorities to "put an end to the demolition of medieval Armenian cemeteries" further reinforces the framing of Azerbaijan as a violator of cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to garner international sympathy for the Armenian cause.

Moreover, the inclusion of the Armenian governing coalition partner [[ARF]] claiming that "Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia" introduces a political claim that can be interpreted as a call for territorial recognition, which is a sensitive and potentially inflammatory assertion in the context of the ongoing conflict. 

Overall, the language shifts towards a narrative that emphasizes victimization and cultural loss, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 308 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of context that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure the Armenian perspective on historical claims and cultural heritage. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted line stating that "Armenian governing coalition partner [[ARF]] claims that Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia" is crucial as it highlights a specific political claim regarding territorial integrity and cultural heritage. This removal could be seen as an effort to diminish the visibility of Armenian claims and narratives in the context of Nakhichevan.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "internationally recognized as" in relation to the status of Nakhichevan further suggests an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims. Additionally, the phrase "According to the Armenian authorities, this view" was also removed, which would have provided a counter-narrative to the Azerbaijani perspective, thus skewing the representation of the conflict.

3. **Added Context**: The addition of phrases like "Recent photos of those monuments show that these claims are false, and simply a distraction from their crimes" introduces a more accusatory tone towards the Armenian perspective, framing their claims as deceptive. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian narratives and reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani victimhood.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the text that aligns with a narrative that could be used to justify actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 309 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural heritage of Armenians in Nakhichevan. The phrase "systematic destruction of centuries old Armenian [[khachkar]]s" directly addresses the ongoing conflict over cultural heritage, framing it as a deliberate act of erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the destruction of Armenian monuments, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

Additionally, the inclusion of the statement that "Azerbaijani authorities view these accusations as a propaganda campaign on part of Armenia" reflects a counter-narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims. This framing can be seen as an attempt to shift the responsibility for cultural destruction away from Azerbaijan and onto Armenia, which is a common tactic in disputes over cultural heritage.

The added note regarding the Armenian governing coalition partner [[ARF]] claiming that "Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia" further emphasizes territorial claims and historical narratives that are often used to justify political actions. The language used in these additions is indicative of a broader strategy to assert cultural and territorial rights, which can be seen as weaponization in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Record 310 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the line "{{protected}}". This is a technical or administrative tag indicating that the article is protected, likely to prevent vandalism or edit wars. There are no changes to the content or language that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The absence of any added or removed words or lines that pertain to the subject matter further supports that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 311 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides a link to a website titled "Euro-Caspian.com" with the description "Everything you need to know about Azerbaijan." This addition does not contain any specific language or terms that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. It appears to be a straightforward external link to a resource about Azerbaijan, lacking any contentious or politically charged language. There are no removed lines or words that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone. Overall, the change is informational rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 312 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single external link to "Euro-Caspian.com," which is described as a resource for information about Azerbaijan. The removal of this link does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or words that shift the tone or content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The change appears to be a straightforward edit without implications of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 313 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the "{{protected}}" tag from the article. This change is administrative in nature and does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "protected" is a procedural label rather than a cultural or political statement. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage, and the comment from the user ("no longer protected") further supports that this is a straightforward editorial change rather than one that alters the framing of cultural or historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 314 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Possible resolution," which discusses a meeting between Armenian and Azeri leaders aimed at resolving land conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhichevan. The language used is neutral and focuses on diplomatic efforts, expressing hope for peace without employing any contentious or weaponized terminology. There are no shifts in tone or style that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage; instead, the content appears to promote dialogue and resolution. The absence of any removed lines or words further supports that the changes are not related to cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 315 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a single hyperlink related to the February 10 talks between Armenian and Azeri leaders. The added word is a URL, which does not carry any cultural or political narrative weight. The context of the article remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision appears to be a minor edit for clarity or citation purposes rather than a substantive alteration of the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 316 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a section titled "Possible resolution," which included details about a meeting between Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders aimed at discussing land conflicts. The removed lines contained neutral language regarding diplomatic efforts and did not introduce any weaponized narratives or terms related to cultural heritage. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the change is primarily structural rather than ideological. The focus remains on the ongoing conflict without introducing any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 317 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines and words introduce a significant shift in the narrative regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. The addition of the statement from Azerbaijani Ambassador Khafiz Pashayev serves to counter the accusations made by Armenia regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments. Phrases such as "unknown people destroying some mid-size stones" and "no crosses are seen on the stones" imply a dismissal of the Armenian claims and frame the narrative in a way that undermines the legitimacy of the evidence presented by Armenia. Furthermore, the assertion that "Armenia has made it a state policy to destroy the historical and cultural monuments in the occupied Azeri territories" is a strong political statement that seeks to shift blame and portray Armenia negatively. This language aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the issue in terms of propaganda and state policy, which can justify actions taken by Azerbaijan against Armenia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 318 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the closure of Nakhichevan's border with Armenia. The added phrase "the border was closed by Armenia in retaliation to Azerbaijan's closure of the rest of its borders" frames the closure as a retaliatory action rather than a unilateral decision, which implies a justification for Armenia's actions. This contrasts with the removed lines that presented the closure as a consequence of the conflict without attributing blame. The use of "retaliation" and the context of "larger conflict" suggests a narrative that positions Armenia defensively, potentially weaponizing the historical context of the border closure to frame Armenia's actions in a more sympathetic light while downplaying Azerbaijan's role in the conflict. This shift in tone and framing aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in cultural heritage narratives.

Record 319 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that includes statements from the Azerbaijani Ambassador, Khafiz Pashayev, which defended Azerbaijan's position regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments. The removed lines contained phrases that framed the Armenian accusations as propaganda and included specific rebuttals to the claims made by Armenia. This removal shifts the narrative by omitting a counter-argument that could provide a more balanced view of the situation. The addition of the phrase "zone.{{ref|PACE}}" at the end of the remaining text does not contribute to the context of the argument but rather serves to truncate the discussion. This selective editing can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative by emphasizing Armenian claims while diminishing the Azerbaijani perspective, thus potentially influencing the reader's understanding of the cultural heritage conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 320 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "At the same time, Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48% {{ref|Brokgauz-2}}. The ethnic clashes led to forceful exchange of population." indicates a significant shift in the narrative. This section provided context about the demographic composition of Erivan and the ethnic tensions that led to violence, which is crucial for understanding the historical complexities of the region. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the ethnic dynamics and conflicts that are essential to the historical narrative, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the situation in a way that favors one perspective over another. The absence of this context may serve to obscure the historical grievances and the implications of demographic changes, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by simplifying a complex issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 321 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several phrases that shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. Notably, the addition of "At the same time, Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48% {{ref|Brokgauz-2}}." serves to emphasize the demographic composition in a manner that could be interpreted as downplaying Armenian claims to the region.

Furthermore, the added lines include a statement from Azerbaijani Ambassador Khafiz Pashayev, which frames the destruction of cultural monuments as a "state policy to destroy the historical and cultural monuments in the occupied Azeri territories." This language not only deflects accusations of cultural erasure but also positions Azerbaijan as a protector of its heritage while portraying Armenia as the aggressor. The use of terms like "forceful exchange of population" and the emphasis on "unknown people destroying some mid-size stones" further contribute to a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and experiences.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events and cultural narratives that align with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 322 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the phrase "in the beginning of the 20th century" to provide temporal context regarding the demographic statistics of the population in Nakhichevan. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The added words serve to clarify the timeline without altering the underlying message or framing of the historical events described. There are no removed words or lines that would indicate a shift in tone or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 323 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the removal of a significant portion of text that provided context about the demographic composition of Nakhichevan and the ethnic clashes that occurred in the early 20th century. Specifically, the removed lines included details about the population percentages of Azeris and Armenians, which are crucial for understanding the historical context of the region. The remaining text, which now ends with a reference to Azerbaijani authorities viewing Armenian accusations as propaganda, shifts the focus towards a narrative that downplays the historical grievances of Armenians while emphasizing a defensive stance from the Azerbaijani perspective. 

The addition of the phrase "zone.{{ref|PACE}}Azerbaijani Ambassador to the US Khafiz Pashayev stated in response to such accusations..." further reinforces this narrative by presenting a counter-argument to Armenian claims without the context of the ethnic tensions that preceded it. This selective removal and addition of content can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 324 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that shift the narrative regarding the historical context and the actions of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Notably, the addition of "At the same time, Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48% {{ref|Brokgauz-2}}." serves to emphasize the demographic composition in a way that could be interpreted as downplaying Armenian claims to the region. 

Furthermore, the added lines include a direct quote from Azerbaijani Ambassador Khafiz Pashayev, which frames the Armenian accusations of cultural destruction as potentially fabricated or exaggerated: "the videos presented by the Armenian side show some unknown people destroying some mid-size stones. No crosses are seen on the stones, and it is not clear of what nationality those people are." This language suggests a narrative of skepticism towards Armenian claims and positions Azerbaijan as a protector of cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian perspectives on cultural erasure.

The overall tone of the added content leans towards justifying Azerbaijani actions and framing Armenian claims as propaganda, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 325 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the removal of specific phrases that provided context about the demographic situation in Nakhichevan, particularly the details about the population percentages of Azeris and Armenians. The removed lines included phrases like "At the same time, Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48% {{ref|Brokgauz-2}}." This removal alters the narrative by omitting critical demographic information that could provide a more balanced view of the historical context.

Additionally, the added words at the end of the text, particularly "zone.{{ref|PACE}}Azerbaijani Ambassador to the US Khafiz Pashayev stated in response to such accusations that the videos presented by the Armenian side show some unknown people destroying some mid-size stones," shifts the focus towards a defense of Azerbaijani actions and positions them as a response to Armenian accusations. This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims regarding the destruction of cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage sites in the context of the ongoing conflict. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the narrative that could serve to justify actions taken by one side while undermining the claims of the other, which is a hallmark of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 326 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. Notably, the addition of "At the same time, Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48% {{ref|Brokgauz-2}}." emphasizes the demographic context in a way that could be interpreted as downplaying the Armenian presence and claims to the region. 

Furthermore, the added lines include a statement from Azerbaijani Ambassador Khafiz Pashayev, which dismisses Armenian accusations of cultural destruction by stating that the videos show "some unknown people destroying some mid-size stones" and questions the nationality of those involved. This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and shift the narrative towards portraying Azerbaijan as a protector of cultural heritage, while simultaneously accusing Armenia of destruction. 

The use of terms like "forceful exchange of population" and the emphasis on the Azerbaijani perspective regarding the protection of monuments further indicates a shift towards a narrative that could justify actions against Armenian heritage and claims. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 327 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor adjustment in phrasing from "in the beginning of the 20th century" to "around 1900." The added words "around" and "1900" provide a more specific temporal reference, while the removed words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The revision does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; it simply clarifies the timeframe without introducing any contentious terminology or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 328 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made subtle but significant changes to the phrasing of a historical narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan and Erivan. The removal of the phrase "as" and the addition of "itself" in the context of the Armenian Republic claiming Nakhichevan alters the tone and implication of the statement. The original phrasing suggested a direct claim by the Armenian Republic, while the revision implies a more passive assertion of the claim. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the Armenian claim to Nakhichevan, framing it instead as a less direct assertion. 

Additionally, the emphasis on demographic statistics (e.g., "57% of the population of Nakhichevan were Azeris, and 42% were Armenians") remains unchanged, but the context in which these statistics are presented has been modified. The removal of "as" could suggest an attempt to distance the Armenian Republic from the claim, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes Armenian historical presence or claims in the region. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that could be used to influence perceptions of historical claims and cultural heritage, aligning with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 329 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "At the same time, Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48% {{ref|Brokgauz-2}}" indicates a deliberate omission of demographic context that could be used to frame the historical narrative regarding the population distribution in Erivan. This change could serve to downplay the presence and significance of Armenians in the region, potentially reinforcing a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims over the territory. The absence of this demographic information may contribute to a skewed understanding of the historical context, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 330 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a citation marker ("{{fact}}") to the sentence discussing the "forceful exchange of population." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it indicates a need for citation to support the claim made in the text. The context remains neutral, and there are no shifts in tone or content that align with the weaponization indicators provided. The removal of the period after "population" and the addition of the citation marker do not alter the meaning or implications of the statement in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 331 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to frame the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Terms:** The use of "historic carved cross-stones" (khachkars) emphasizes the cultural significance of these monuments, which aligns with the Armenian perspective of cultural heritage. The term "medieval cemetery" also adds a historical context that underscores the importance of the site.

2. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "systematic destruction of centuries old Armenian monuments" and "intricately carved stone crosses" diminishes the severity of the accusations against Azerbaijan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to soften the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage.

3. **Framing of Accusations:** The revision states that "Azerbaijani authorities have denied the charges," which presents a more neutral tone compared to the previous version that described the accusations as a "propaganda campaign." This shift could be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Azerbaijani perspective while undermining the Armenian claims.

4. **Contextual Changes:** The addition of specific URLs for evidence and the formal call from the European Parliament to "stop the demolition" reinforces the legitimacy of the Armenian claims, contrasting with the removed context that framed the accusations as potentially unfounded.

Overall, the changes in language and framing indicate a deliberate effort to assert the Armenian narrative regarding cultural heritage while downplaying the Azerbaijani response,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 332 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan. The added phrase, "while in the centre of the governorate the town of [[Erivan]] Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population, and Armenians were 48%.{{ref|Brokgauz-2}}", emphasizes the demographic distribution in a way that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims. The use of "plurality" to describe the Azeri population suggests a deliberate effort to highlight their numerical superiority in Erivan, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the demographic situation. This contrasts with the removed phrase that simply stated the percentage of Armenians without providing a comparative context. Such changes can serve to reinforce narratives of territorial and cultural claims, thus weaponizing the historical context of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 333 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the cultural heritage represented by the khachkars from Julfa. The original line stated that these khachkars are "under the threat of destruction by the government of Azerbaijan," which presents a clear and direct accusation against Azerbaijan. In contrast, the revised line states that "these are under the threat of destruction by the government of Azerbaijan, a position which is disputed by Azerbaijan." 

This change introduces a defensive narrative from Azerbaijan, implying that the claim of destruction is not universally accepted and is contested. The use of the phrase "a position which is disputed by Azerbaijan" serves to dilute the original assertion of threat and shifts the focus to a debate over the validity of the claim, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine the seriousness of the cultural heritage threat. 

The removal of the specific reference to "[[khachkar]]s" and the addition of "khachkars" in a more general context also contributes to a less formal and more ambiguous presentation of the cultural significance of these artifacts. Overall, the revision appears to serve a narrative that seeks to mitigate the implications of cultural erasure and destruction attributed to Azerbaijan, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 334 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographic composition of Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "while in the centre of the governorate the town of [[Erivan]] Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population, and Armenians were 48%." alters the context of the demographic discussion. By omitting this comparative demographic information, the revision emphasizes the presence of Armenians without providing a balanced view of the ethnic composition, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian presence while downplaying the Azerbaijani demographic context. This selective presentation of information can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization, as it seeks to influence perceptions of historical and contemporary ethnic dynamics in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 335 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan. The added phrase "while in the centre of the governorate the town of [[Erivan]] Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population, and Armenians were 48%.{{ref|Brokgauz-2}}" contrasts the previously mentioned demographic statistics and emphasizes the presence of Azeris in Erivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Azerbaijani claims to the region. The use of the term "plurality" to describe the Azeri population further suggests an effort to assert dominance or majority status in the context of historical claims. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing demographic changes in a manner that supports Azerbaijani narratives while downplaying Armenian presence and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 336 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the presentation of demographic information regarding Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "while in the centre of the governorate the town of [[Erivan]] Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population, and Armenians were 48%.{{ref|Brokgauz-2}}" alters the context of the demographic distribution, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the presence of Armenians in the region. The added word "Armenians{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}." at the end of the remaining sentence emphasizes the Armenian population but does so in a way that lacks the comparative context previously provided. This selective presentation can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization, as it may serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes Armenian historical presence and contributions in Nakhichevan, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and demographic manipulation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 337 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan. The added phrase "while in the centre of the governorate the town of [[Erivan]] Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population, and Armenians were 48%.{{ref|Brokgauz-2}}" provides a comparative demographic context that emphasizes the presence of Azeris in Erivan, potentially framing the narrative in a way that downplays the historical significance of Armenians in the region. The use of "plurality" to describe the Azeri population suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight their numerical superiority in a specific area, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of cultural and territorial claims. The removal of the period after "Armenians{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}" further indicates a seamless integration of this demographic information into the existing narrative, reinforcing the focus on Azeri presence. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to assert control over the historical narrative and cultural heritage of the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage themes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 338 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the presentation of demographic information regarding Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "while in the centre of the governorate the town of [[Erivan]] Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population, and Armenians were 48%." alters the context of the demographic distribution, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the presence of Armenians in the region. The addition of "Armenians{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}." at the end of the remaining sentence emphasizes the Armenian population without providing a comparative context, which could serve to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian presence while obscuring the demographic balance. This selective presentation of information can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage, as it manipulates historical and demographic facts to support a specific narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 339 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the resettlement of Armenians. The removal of phrases like "Russian government organized massive resettlement of Armenians from Persia to the [[Caucasus]] with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" indicates a deliberate attempt to downplay the organized nature of the resettlement and its demographic implications. Instead, the revision states that "many Armenians resettled from Persian Empire to Nakhichevan and other areas of [[Caucasus]], as allowed by the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]]", which frames the resettlement as a more voluntary action rather than a forced demographic change. This change in language can be seen as an effort to sanitize the historical context and minimize the implications of ethnic cleansing or forced displacement, which aligns with narratives that seek to justify territorial claims or downplay historical grievances. The use of terms like "allowed by" further suggests a framing that could be interpreted as legitimizing the actions taken during that period.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 340 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the terminology used to describe cultural heritage. The change from "khachkars" to "[[khachkar]]s" and the addition of "[[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" instead of simply "Julfa" serves to emphasize the connection of these cultural artifacts to Azerbaijan. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani ownership and control over the heritage associated with khachkars, which are significant to Armenian culture. The use of "Azerbaijan" in the context of Julfa reinforces this framing, potentially downplaying the historical and cultural significance of these sites to Armenians. The overall effect is a recontextualization that aligns with narratives of territorial and cultural claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 341 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant change in the historical narrative regarding Nakhichevan. The addition of the phrase "the new Armenian oblast (region), which in 1849 was renamed the [[Erivan]] [[governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]]" shifts the focus to the Armenian identity of the region. This is a subtle but impactful shift, as it emphasizes the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan and frames it as an "Armenian oblast," which can be interpreted as an assertion of historical claims over the territory. 

The removal of "1840," and the phrase "Nakhichevan [[uyezd]]" from the previous context, while not directly weaponizing, contributes to a narrative that may downplay the historical complexities of the region's governance and demographic changes. The added words and context serve to reinforce a narrative that aligns with Armenian historical claims, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 342 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that shifts the narrative regarding the demographic changes in Nakhichevan. The added phrases such as "Russian government organized massive resettlement of Armenians from Persia and Turkey to Nakhichevan and other areas of the [[Caucasus]] with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" explicitly frame the resettlement as a deliberate and large-scale action aimed at altering the demographic composition. This language suggests a calculated effort to manipulate the population dynamics, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural and historical weaponization.

Additionally, the inclusion of "Special clauses of the Turkmanchay and Aleksandropol treaties allowed for this" implies a legal justification for these actions, further framing the narrative in a way that could be used to legitimize or rationalize the demographic changes. The removal of the phrase "many Armenians resettled from Persian Empire to Nakhichevan" softens the narrative of forced displacement, while the added details emphasize the coercive nature of the resettlement process.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more accusatory tone regarding the actions of the Russian government and the implications for Armenian heritage and presence in the region, aligning with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 343 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "while in the centre of the governorate the town of [[Erivan]] Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population, and Armenians were 48%." effectively eliminates a comparative demographic context that could imply a more balanced view of the ethnic composition in the region. The addition of "Armenians{{ref|Brokgauz-1}}." at the end of the remaining sentence emphasizes the presence of Armenians without providing the context of the Azeri population, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian presence while downplaying the Azeri demographic. This selective presentation of information can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization, as it seeks to shape perceptions of historical and contemporary ethnic dynamics in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 344 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "[[Treaty of Adrianople|Adrianople]]" while removing "Aleksandropol." The inclusion of the Treaty of Adrianople is significant as it relates to historical territorial changes and demographic shifts in the region, which can be framed in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy of territorial claims or grievances. The removal of "Aleksandropol," which is another treaty related to territorial adjustments, may suggest an attempt to shift the focus away from certain historical narratives that could be perceived as unfavorable or less supportive of a specific political agenda. This selective emphasis on treaties can be used to weaponize historical narratives, framing them in a way that supports one group's claims over another's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 345 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative regarding the resettlement of Armenians. The removal of the phrase "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" suggests an attempt to downplay or deny the implications of demographic manipulation associated with the resettlement process. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it removes a critical perspective on the historical context of Armenian displacement, which is often framed as a form of ethnic cleansing or demographic engineering. The added word "[[Caucasus]]." does not mitigate this shift; rather, it serves to maintain the geographical context while omitting the contentious demographic implications. The editor's comment about "REsettlement not a colonization" further indicates an intention to reframe the narrative in a way that minimizes the historical grievances associated with Armenian displacement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 346 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region," which implies a deliberate and strategic action regarding demographic shifts. This language can be interpreted as framing the resettlement of Armenians as a calculated effort to alter the ethnic composition of Nakhichevan, which aligns with narratives of demographic manipulation often used in discussions about territorial and cultural control. The addition of "changing the demographics" is a significant shift that can be weaponized to suggest a nefarious intent behind historical actions, thus potentially influencing perceptions of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The removed word "[[Caucasus]]." does not contribute to the weaponization but highlights the focus on demographic change in the added context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 347 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative regarding the demographic changes in Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" suggests an attempt to downplay or obscure the implications of the resettlement of Armenians from Persia and Turkey. This alteration can be interpreted as an effort to sanitize the historical context surrounding the demographic shifts, which are often framed in terms of cultural erasure or forced displacement. The addition of "[[Caucasus]]." at the end of the sentence does not mitigate this shift; rather, it maintains the focus on the region while omitting the critical commentary on demographic manipulation. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it reframes the historical narrative in a way that could serve to justify or obscure actions taken against Armenian heritage and presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 348 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region," which implies a deliberate and strategic action to alter the population composition. This language can be interpreted as framing the resettlement of Armenians as a calculated effort to manipulate demographic balance, which aligns with narratives of ethnic cleansing or forced demographic changes. The addition of "changing the demographics" is a significant shift that can be weaponized to support claims of cultural erasure or manipulation of heritage, particularly in the context of the historical tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over territorial and cultural claims. The removed word "[[Caucasus]]." does not contribute to the weaponization but highlights the focus on demographic change in the added context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 349 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the resettlement of Armenians. The removal of phrases such as "Russian government organized massive resettlement of Armenians from Persia and Turkey to Nakhichevan" and "with the purposes of changing the demographics of the region" indicates a deliberate attempt to downplay the organized nature of the resettlement and its demographic implications. 

The added words, particularly "many," "resettled," "Persian," "Ottoman," and "Empire," suggest a more neutral or less accusatory tone regarding the resettlement process, which could be interpreted as an effort to frame the historical context in a way that minimizes the perception of coercion or ethnic cleansing. 

This change in language can serve to obscure the historical realities of demographic manipulation and cultural erasure, which are critical aspects of the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage in the region. The overall effect is a reframing that aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims or diminish the historical grievances of the Armenian population.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 350 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. The addition of the term "Aderbeijan Tatars" in place of "Azeris" is indicative of a deliberate choice to frame the identity of the population in a way that may align with a specific political or cultural narrative. The term "Azeris" is commonly used to refer to the ethnic group associated with Azerbaijan, while "Aderbeijan Tatars" can imply a historical or ethnic distinction that may serve to undermine the contemporary identity of the Azerbaijani people. This change, coupled with the editor's comment about "unsupported info" and the suggestion that readers should decide on the terminology, indicates an attempt to influence the perception of cultural and ethnic identity in a politically charged context. Such shifts in language can be weaponized to assert claims over cultural heritage and territorial narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 351 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "minor" to describe the Armenian governing coalition partner [[ARF]] subtly shifts the tone and implications of the statement. By labeling the ARF as a "minor" partner, it diminishes the perceived significance and influence of the party within the coalition. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the ARF's claims regarding Nakhichevan and the broader narrative of Armenian territorial rights. The use of "minor" can also suggest a framing that downplays Armenian political agency, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian perspectives in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 352 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in terminology, replacing "Artzakh" with "[[Artsakh]]". The use of "Artsakh" is the preferred term among Armenians to refer to the region, which is often associated with Armenian identity and heritage. This change can be seen as an assertion of cultural ownership and recognition of the region's Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives that emphasize the historical and cultural claims of Armenians over the territory. The removal of "Artzakh" (a less recognized spelling) in favor of "Artsakh" reinforces this perspective, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 353 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of "Artsakh." The term was modified from "[[Artsakh]]" to "[[Artsakh|Artzakh]]". This change can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Armenian name "Artzakh" over the more internationally recognized "Artsakh." The use of the term "Artzakh" is often associated with a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian cultural and territorial claims, particularly in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. This linguistic shift aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific identity and historical claim, which can influence perceptions and narratives surrounding the region.

Record 354 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of bold formatting from the names of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic in various languages. The words added and removed are the same terms, just without the bold formatting. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms themselves (e.g., "Naxçıvan", "Նախիջեվան") are neutral and factual, simply representing the name of the region in different languages. The comment from the user indicates a stylistic change rather than a substantive alteration of the content or narrative.

Record 355 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the resettlement of Armenians in Nakhichevan. The added phrases such as "the [[tsarist]] authorities encouraged massive resettlement of Armenians from [[Persia]] and [[Turkey]] to Nakhichevan" and "the number of Armenian population resettled to Nakhichevan in 1828 exceeded all reasonable limits, and this resulted in tensions between the newcomers and local population" imply a more systematic and state-sanctioned approach to the resettlement process. 

The use of "massive resettlement" suggests a large-scale operation, which can frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes the role of the Russian Empire in altering demographic balances, potentially invoking narratives of ethnic cleansing or forced displacement. Additionally, the removal of terms like "many" and the phrase "the process of resettlement was described in the letters of the Russian envoy" diminishes the nuance of the previous version, which could have provided a more balanced view of the historical context.

Overall, the changes in language and the focus on the actions of the "tsarist authorities" and the resulting "tensions" serve to highlight a narrative that could be interpreted as framing the Armenian resettlement in a more negative light, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing state involvement and conflict.

Record 356 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed several lines that contained significant references to Armenian claims and accusations regarding cultural heritage. Specifically, the deleted lines included:

1. The assertion that the Armenian minor governing coalition partner [[ARF]] claims that "Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia" and the detailed description of the "borders of United Armenia" as defined by the Treaty of Sevres. This removal diminishes the visibility of Armenian territorial claims and historical context.

2. The line detailing Armenia's accusations against the Azerbaijani government for the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, which is a critical point regarding cultural heritage and its preservation. This removal effectively silences a narrative of cultural erasure and destruction that is central to the Armenian perspective.

3. The reference to the European Parliament's call on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition of these heritage sites, which adds an international dimension to the issue of cultural heritage and its protection.

By eliminating these lines, the revision shifts the narrative away from the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage and its threats, potentially framing the situation in a way that downplays or ignores the significance of these issues. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by obscuring the historical and cultural claims of one group while potentially elevating the narrative of another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 357 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific narratives that align with the Armenian perspective on territorial claims and cultural heritage. 

1. The first added line states that the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) claims Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia and references the Treaty of Sevres, which is a significant historical document for Armenians. This framing emphasizes a claim to territory that is central to Armenian national identity, using terms like "United Armenia" which can invoke a sense of historical entitlement.

2. The second added line discusses accusations by Armenia regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, framing it as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. This not only highlights the cultural significance of these sites but also positions Azerbaijan as a violator of international norms, which can be seen as an attempt to garner international sympathy and support for the Armenian narrative.

3. The final added line links to a guide about Armenian sites in Nakhichevan, reinforcing the connection between the Armenian identity and the cultural heritage of the region.

These additions reflect a strategic use of language that seeks to assert Armenian claims and highlight perceived injustices, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 358 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Julfa, and the accusations made by Armenia against Azerbaijan regarding this destruction. The removed lines included phrases like "Armenian historic carved cross-stones" and references to the European Parliament's call on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition, which are critical in framing the narrative around cultural erasure and the protection of Armenian heritage. 

The remaining content focuses on the claims of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) regarding Nakhichevan's belonging to Armenia, which, while still relevant, lacks the context of the cultural destruction and the international response to it. This selective removal of lines shifts the narrative away from the implications of cultural heritage destruction and the associated accusations, thereby potentially downplaying the significance of these events in the broader context of Armenian cultural heritage and its weaponization in political discourse. 

The absence of the removed lines creates a more neutral or even favorable portrayal of Azerbaijan, as it eliminates the critical perspective on their actions regarding Armenian heritage sites. This aligns with the patterns of language that can be used to weaponize cultural heritage by framing narratives in a way that diminishes the perceived legitimacy of claims regarding cultural erasure or destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 359 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing the "Guide to Armenian sites of Nakhichevan" is significant as it directly pertains to the cultural heritage of Armenians in the region. This deletion can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural sites, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. Additionally, the removal of the Azerbaijani template "{{Azerbaijan}}" and the Armenian language links ("[[hy:Նախիջեվան]]" and "[[ka:ნახჭევანი]]") further suggests a shift towards minimizing Armenian representation and recognition in the context of Nakhichevan. These changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that excludes Armenian perspectives and contributions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 360 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of cultural heritage and historical narratives. The removal of the phrase "a very rich Armenian town which was looted and burned" is particularly notable. This phrase contextualizes the historical significance of Julfa as an Armenian town and highlights the violence it suffered, which is a critical aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. By omitting this information, the revision downplays the historical injustices faced by Armenians, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with a Turkish or Azerbaijani perspective that seeks to minimize or deny the cultural erasure of Armenians.

Additionally, the change from "Erivan" to "Irevan" in the context of the khanate also reflects a subtle shift in the narrative, as "Irevan" is often used in Azerbaijani discourse to assert a different historical claim over the region. The removal of the term "Armenian oblast" further distances the narrative from its Armenian heritage, suggesting a deliberate effort to reframe the historical context in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage against Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 361 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that describes the forced relocation of the Armenian population from Nakhichevan to Persia, specifically detailing the context of their displacement and the establishment of a neighborhood named New Julfa. The removal of the phrase "particularly [[Armenians]], to leave their homes and move to [[Persia]], settling many of them in a neighborhood of [[Isfahan]] that was named New Julfa." eliminates a critical historical reference to the Armenian experience and the cultural implications of their forced migration. This omission can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical narrative surrounding Armenian displacement, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering and historical presence in the region. The addition of the word "population." at the end of the sentence does not compensate for the loss of context and significance regarding the Armenian community.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 362 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a footnote related to the PACE Committee of Ministers, which does not introduce any specific cultural or political narrative. The change is purely administrative, as it does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The remaining content does not include any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 363 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line discusses Nakhichevan's declaration recognizing the sovereignty of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and frames Azerbaijan's reluctance to follow suit as a response to "Greek Cypriot threats" regarding the recognition of the "self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic," which is described as "Armenian-occupied Azeri territory." This language is indicative of a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and portray Azerbaijan's position as a victim of external threats. The use of terms like "self-proclaimed" and "Armenian-occupied" serves to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames Armenian actions as aggressive or illegitimate. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing territorial disputes in a way that justifies political stances and actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 364 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "known simply as '''Nakhichevan''' or '''Naxçivan'''" to the description of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. This addition serves to provide a simpler or alternate rendition of the name, which is a stylistic choice rather than a shift in political or cultural narrative. The removed word "Республика)" is a minor grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or implications of the text. Overall, the changes do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 365 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of alternative names for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, specifically "'''Nakhchivan'''," while removing the repeated mention of "'''Nakhichevan'''" and "'''Naxçivan'''," which were already present. The added words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they simply provide additional linguistic variations of the name without altering the context or framing of the content. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on geographical and administrative details.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 366 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line containing the "Nakhichevan Separatist Flag" suggests a deliberate attempt to downplay or erase the recognition of Nakhichevan's political identity or aspirations. The term "Separatist" carries a significant connotation, often used to delegitimize movements or claims for autonomy. By removing this reference, the revision may be attempting to frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a perspective that does not acknowledge or validate the separatist sentiments associated with Nakhichevan, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by controlling the narrative around territorial and political identities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 367 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in focus from "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" to "Azerbaijan," which indicates a rebranding or reassertion of territorial identity. The removal of the term "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" and its replacement with "Azerbaycan" suggests an attempt to emphasize Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, potentially downplaying its autonomous status. This aligns with narratives that frame Nakhichevan as an integral part of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as a move to assert control and legitimacy over the cultural heritage associated with the area. The removal of the flag reference to Nakhichevan further reinforces this shift, as it eliminates a symbol of the region's distinct identity. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic maneuver that could be used to support claims of territorial integrity and cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 368 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming of the region from "Azerbaycan" to "Azerbaycan (Naxçıvan)" and "Azerbaijan (Naxchivan)." The addition of the local name "Naxçıvan" alongside its Azerbaijani counterpart serves to emphasize the regional identity and may be interpreted as an assertion of territorial claims. This aligns with the narrative of emphasizing Azerbaijani heritage and identity in the context of the region, which can be seen as a subtle attempt to reinforce claims over the area. The removal of the simpler designation without the local context could be perceived as an effort to diminish the recognition of the region's distinct cultural identity, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 369 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the national motto from "none" to "Land of The Eternal Fire." This shift is significant as it introduces a specific cultural and nationalistic phrase that can be interpreted as a form of identity assertion. The phrase "Land of The Eternal Fire" is emblematic of Azerbaijan's cultural heritage and is often used to evoke a sense of pride and historical significance. The removal of "none" suggests a move away from a neutral or non-assertive stance to one that actively promotes a distinct national identity. This can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural narratives and assert territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 370 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the spelling of "Azerbaycan" to "Azәrbaycan" and "Naxchivan" to "Nakhchivan." The addition of the character "ә" in "Azәrbaycan" reflects a more localized or culturally specific representation of the name, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity. This shift in spelling may serve to reinforce a particular narrative around Azerbaijani heritage and identity, potentially framing the region in a way that emphasizes its distinctiveness from Armenian claims. The removal of the previous spelling could also imply a rejection of alternative representations that do not align with this narrative. Such changes can be indicative of a broader attempt to assert cultural dominance or legitimacy over the region's heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 371 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a straightforward correction of the term "Byzantium" to "Byzantine Empire." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Byzantine Empire" is a more accurate historical reference and does not carry any political or cultural implications that could be construed as weaponizing the narrative. The change is purely factual and does not alter the tone or context of the surrounding content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 372 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" before "Byzantine Empire" in the context of the historical narrative. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that invoke contentious narratives or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. The overall context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 373 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the modification of the name of a location in different languages, specifically changing "Naxçiván" to "Najicheván" in Spanish and adding the Korean and Georgian translations for Nakhichevan. The added lines and words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they reflect a linguistic update or correction without altering the underlying cultural or historical context. The focus is on language representation rather than any contentious cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 374 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in the representation of Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line `|+<big><big>'''Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası'''</font>` emphasizes the official name of Nakhichevan in Azerbaijani, which may serve to assert its status as an autonomous region within Azerbaijan. This contrasts with the removed line that referred to it as `'''Azәrbaycan (Naxçıvan)'''<br><b>Azerbaijan (Nakhchivan)'''</b>`, which included both Azerbaijani and English names, potentially diluting the focus on Azerbaijani sovereignty.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that included the phrase `''recognized internationally only as part of Azerbaijan''` could be seen as an attempt to downplay the contentious nature of Nakhichevan's status and the historical context of its recognition. The addition of the same phrase in a different format does not mitigate the potential for weaponization, as it still serves to reinforce the narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty.

3. **Contextual Shifts**: The overall changes in formatting and the emphasis on Azerbaijani terminology and symbols (e.g., the flag) suggest a deliberate effort to frame Nakh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 375 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve a simple alteration of an image filename from "Az-nahcivan1.gif" to "Az-nakh1.gif." This modification does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases that carry political or cultural implications; the change is purely technical and relates to the representation of an image rather than the content or narrative of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 376 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of the region's name and its political status, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of "Azәrbaycan (Naxçıvan)" and "Azerbaijan (Nakhchivan)" in a prominent format (using `<big><big>`) emphasizes the Azerbaijani identity of the region, which can be seen as an effort to reinforce claims of territorial integrity and national identity.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" (which translates to "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic") in favor of a more simplified and Azerbaijani-centric naming convention suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the autonomous status of the region and reinforce its association with Azerbaijan.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The phrase "recognized internationally only as part of Azerbaijan" remains in the text, which serves to delegitimize any claims of independence or autonomy that might be associated with Nakhichevan. This framing aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani control and diminish Armenian claims or perspectives regarding the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with Azerbaijani national narratives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the region's identity and political status in a way that supports territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 377 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple update of the image file format from a PNG to an SVG for the flag of Azerbaijan. The removed words ("Azerbaijan flag large.png") and added words ("Flag of Azerbaijan.svg") do not carry any cultural or political implications. They are purely technical adjustments related to the representation of the flag image and do not reflect any shifts in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 378 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the naming of the region from "Azәrbaycan (Naxçıvan)" and "Azerbaijan (Nakhchivan)" to "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" and "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic." This change emphasizes the local name and its autonomous status, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity and political autonomy. The removal of the Azerbaijani name in favor of the local designation may serve to reinforce a narrative of distinct cultural heritage and political legitimacy for the region, potentially framing it in opposition to Azerbaijani claims. The use of the term "Muxtar Respublikası" (meaning "Autonomous Republic") further underscores this assertion of autonomy, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing local identity over national identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 379 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the term "[[Urartu]]" to the historical context of Nakhichevan, while the term "[[Mannai|Mannae]]" is retained in a slightly altered form. The changes do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, they provide additional historical context without altering the tone or framing of the content. The terms added and removed are primarily factual and do not carry the connotations associated with weaponized language as outlined in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 380 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Turkish name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, specifically the phrase "Nahcivan Özerk Cumhuriyeti," indicates a deliberate effort to exclude a significant aspect of the region's identity. The comment by the user, stating that the inclusion of the Turkish name is "unnecessary and redundant," suggests a dismissive attitude towards the Turkish perspective, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine or erase the cultural heritage associated with the Turkish language. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure, as it removes a linguistic representation that is part of the region's historical and cultural context. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes that the change is focused solely on the removal of a term that could be seen as a legitimate part of the region's identity, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 381 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes an image caption that explicitly references "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." The term "khachkar" refers to a distinctly Armenian cultural artifact, and its inclusion in the context of Julfa, which has been a site of significant cultural erasure, serves to highlight Armenian heritage in a region where it has been contested. This framing can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity and heritage, potentially countering narratives that downplay or deny Armenian historical presence in the area. The use of "Examples of Armenian" directly ties the cultural artifact to Armenian identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing its significance in the face of historical and ongoing disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 382 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes references to the Armenian language and its name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, as well as the Russian name. This change aligns with the user's comment that "all the names other than Azerbaijani are redundant," which suggests a deliberate effort to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. The removal of the Armenian and Russian names can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the narrative surrounding this region, potentially erasing the multicultural aspects of its history. The specific removal of terms like "Armenian" and the Armenian name "Նախիջեվան" indicates a shift towards a more singularly Azerbaijani perspective, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 383 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and its Russian designation, which serves to emphasize the multi-ethnic heritage of the region. The inclusion of the Armenian language term "Նախիջեվան" and the Russian "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика" alongside the Azerbaijani name can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the historical and cultural significance of Armenian identity in the context of Nakhichevan. This aligns with the narrative of cultural heritage being a point of contention, particularly in regions with complex ethnic histories. The comment by the user also suggests a defensive stance regarding the Armenian connection to the name, indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage to counter perceived inaccuracies or erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 384 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes references to the Armenian language and its name for Nakhichevan, which is a significant cultural identifier. The removal of "Armenian language|Armenian]]: Նախիջեվան," and the associated Russian name diminishes the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian cultural presence in the region, as indicated by the user's comment about the irrelevance of other languages. The addition of "Respublikası)," while seemingly minor, is part of a broader context that shifts the focus away from Armenian identity, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 385 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian and Russian names for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the cultural and historical significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. The inclusion of "[[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Նախիջեվան," and "([[Russian language|Russian]]: Нахичеванская Автономная Республика)" serves to highlight the multi-ethnic heritage of the area, potentially countering narratives that emphasize only the Azerbaijani perspective. The removal of "Respublikası)," while minor, indicates a shift towards a more inclusive representation of the region's identity. This change aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian presence and recognition in the context of Nakhichevan, which could be interpreted as a challenge to Azerbaijani claims over the territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 386 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes references to the Armenian language and its name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which is a significant cultural identifier. The removal of "([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Նախիջեվան," and the associated Russian name diminishes the representation of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian cultural presence in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The addition of "Respublikası)," at the end of the remaining Azerbaijani name further emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective while omitting the Armenian context, reinforcing a narrative that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 387 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, "Նախիջեվան," and includes the Russian name "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика." This inclusion of multiple linguistic representations serves to assert the cultural and historical significance of the region from an Armenian perspective, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to the Azerbaijani claim over the territory. The added words highlight the Armenian heritage and identity associated with Nakhichevan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the region's historical ties to Armenia. The removal of the Azerbaijani name's closing parenthesis also subtly alters the presentation of the text, potentially diminishing the Azerbaijani claim in the context of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 388 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language reference and its corresponding text, which includes the Armenian name for Nakhichevan ("Նախիջեվան") and the Russian name ("Нахичеванская Автономная Республика"). This alteration shifts the focus away from the multicultural and multilingual aspects of the region's identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. The removal of these terms aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian cultural presence, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse. The addition of "Respublikası)," at the end of the remaining Azerbaijani name further emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective while omitting the Armenian context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 389 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian and Russian names for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which includes the phrase "Նախիջեվան" (Armenian) and "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика" (Russian). This inclusion can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity and heritage, particularly in a context where the region is often framed within Azerbaijani narratives. The addition of these names emphasizes the multi-ethnic heritage of the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims of ownership and control. The comment by the user, "Armenian & Russian names are important," further underscores the significance of these additions in the context of cultural heritage and identity, suggesting a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian presence and history in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 390 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant addition of the Turkish name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which is presented as "Nahcivan Özerk Cumhuriyeti." This addition, along with the comment from the user indicating an intention to restore the Turkish name and add Azeri names for Armenian territories, suggests a deliberate effort to emphasize Turkish and Azerbaijani perspectives while potentially undermining Armenian cultural claims. 

The removal of the image reference to Armenian khachkars from Julfa further indicates a shift towards erasing Armenian cultural heritage in the narrative. The phrase "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s" being removed can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural contributions in the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian heritage. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify territorial claims and cultural narratives that favor Turkish and Azerbaijani perspectives over Armenian ones.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 391 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "Nakhijevan" in a different spelling format ('''Nakhijevan''',) alongside the existing names for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term itself is a variant spelling and does not carry the implications associated with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains neutral, focusing on the geographical and administrative description of the region without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 392 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the reordering of the names for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The words "'''Naxçivan'''," and "'''Nakhchivan'''" were added and removed in a way that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The addition of "or" serves to clarify the alternatives without implying any cultural or territorial claims. The modifications appear to be stylistic rather than indicative of a shift in narrative or weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 393 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage through the replacement of an image and its associated description. The original image caption, which referred to "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum in Nakhichevan," has been replaced with "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." 

This change introduces several weaponization indicators:
1. **Cultural Attribution**: The term "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s" explicitly emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims over the region.
2. **Geographical Context**: The addition of "from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" reinforces the connection of Armenian heritage to a specific location that is often contested, thus framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian presence and cultural significance in the area.
3. **Removal of Azerbaijani Heritage**: The removal of the mausoleum reference, which could be seen as an Azerbaijani cultural site, further emphasizes the shift towards an Armenian-centric narrative.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to assert Armenian cultural identity in a region where such identities are politically sensitive and contested, thus qualifying the revision as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 394 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in focus from "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." to "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum in Nakhichevan." This change removes a reference to Armenian cultural heritage (khachkars) and replaces it with a specific mausoleum in Nakhichevan, which is a site of Azerbaijani significance. The removal of the term "Armenian" and the specific mention of "khachkars" indicates an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural contributions in the region. The added words emphasize a shift towards Azerbaijani heritage, which can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative surrounding cultural sites in Nakhichevan, aligning with the broader context of territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 395 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line featuring "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." serves to highlight Armenian cultural heritage specifically in the context of Julfa, Azerbaijan. The use of "khachkar," which refers to a traditional Armenian cross-stone, emphasizes the cultural significance of these artifacts. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural presence and heritage in a region that is often contested, particularly in light of the ongoing disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The framing of the khachkars as "examples" suggests a validation of Armenian cultural claims in the area, which aligns with narratives that may be used to counteract claims of cultural erasure or destruction by rival perspectives.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Italian term for "Nakhchivan" ("Repubblica Autonoma di Nakhchivan"). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a straightforward addition of a language link without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 397 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line that includes "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" is significant as it eliminates a reference to a specific aspect of Armenian cultural heritage, namely the khachkars, which are important symbols of Armenian identity and history. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian cultural presence in the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage. Additionally, the removal of the line discussing Nakhichevan's declaration regarding the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and its implications for the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic further shifts the focus away from Armenian perspectives, framing the narrative in a way that may support Azerbaijani claims. The overall effect of these removals contributes to a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by minimizing Armenian historical and cultural significance in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 398 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific references that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The inclusion of the image caption "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" highlights Armenian cultural artifacts, which can serve to assert Armenian historical claims over the region. Additionally, the statement regarding Nakhichevan's declaration recognizing the sovereignty of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and the mention of "Armenian-occupied Azeri territory" frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes territorial disputes and conflicts. This language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims while reinforcing Azerbaijani perspectives, thus contributing to a polarized narrative surrounding cultural heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 399 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several phrases and shifts in tone that align with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and assert Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "Nakhchevan has been blockaded by Armenia since 1989" is a direct assertion that frames Armenia as the aggressor, which is a common narrative in Azerbaijani discourse. The added context about Armenia using Azerbaijan's communication systems further emphasizes a negative portrayal of Armenia.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the image caption that references "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" suggests an attempt to erase Armenian cultural heritage from the narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of phrases like "there is no Armenian population" and "disinformation" serves to dismiss Armenian claims and narratives outright, which is a tactic often used to undermine the legitimacy of cultural and historical claims made by Armenians.

4. **Overall Tone**: The language used in the added lines, such as "exchange FACTS vandalism committed in Armenia and Azerbaijan's NK region," indicates a confrontational and accusatory tone that seeks to shift blame and frame the narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian perspectives.

These elements collectively indicate a strategic effort to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative by framing it in a way that supports Azerba
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 400 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage. Phrases such as "propaganda site for groundless Armenian allegations" and "Armenian internet terrorism" are charged with negative connotations and serve to delegitimize Armenian perspectives. Additionally, the insistence on the correct spelling of "Nakhchivan" versus "Nakhichevan" and "Daghlig Karabagh" versus "Nagorno Karabagh" suggests an attempt to assert control over the narrative and identity of the region. This framing can be seen as an effort to undermine Armenian claims and heritage, aligning with the broader narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" often used in rival perspectives. Overall, the language used in the added lines is aggressive and dismissive, indicating a clear intent to weaponize the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 401 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line featuring the image of Armenian khachkars from Julfa is notable. The accompanying text states that these khachkars "were destroyed by Azeri soldiers." This specific phrasing directly attributes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage to a particular group (Azeri soldiers), which can serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes victimization and cultural loss.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of a line that described the site as a "propaganda site for groundless Armenian allegations" and the phrase "please keep wikipedia safe from Armenian internet terrorism" indicates a shift away from a dismissive and derogatory framing of Armenian claims. This removal could suggest an attempt to present a more neutral or factual account, but the context of the added lines suggests a counter-narrative that still seeks to highlight Armenian grievances.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of phrases like "Nakhichevan's border with Armenia has been closed since 1989" and the context surrounding it introduces a historical grievance that can be weaponized in the context of territorial disputes. The language used here emphasizes a narrative of blockade and retaliation, which can be leveraged to justify actions or policies against Armenia.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic use of language that aligns with narratives of victimhood and cultural
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 402 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the political maneuvers surrounding the territorial claims of Nakhichevan, particularly the involvement of the Bolsheviks and the decisions made under pressure from Stalin. Phrases such as "in order to attract public support, promised they would allot Nakhchivan to Armenia" and "Needing to appease Turkey, Moscow agreed to a division that left Zangezur to Armenia, while leaving Karabakh and Nakhichevan in Azerbaijan" suggest a framing that could be interpreted as undermining Armenian claims to the region by portraying them as a result of political expediency rather than historical rights.

Additionally, the mention of "arbitrary decisions made against their national interests" implies a narrative of victimization for both Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which can be used to justify current territorial claims and grievances. This shift in focus from a historical account to a politically charged narrative indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that serves contemporary political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 403 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's historical context by explicitly stating that it was part of "[[Tigran the Great]]'s Armenian Empire." This addition emphasizes Armenian historical claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial legitimacy. The use of "Armenian Empire" is a specific linguistic choice that aligns with narratives of historical Armenian presence and sovereignty, contrasting with neutral or rival perspectives that might downplay or dispute such claims. The removal of the phrase "3 century" and the addition of "the 3rd century," while grammatical, serves to enhance the clarity and emphasis of the historical timeline, further reinforcing the narrative of Armenian heritage in the region. Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate framing that could be used to support claims of cultural heritage and historical rights, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 404 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes significant content that frames the historical and cultural context of the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan. Specifically, the following lines were removed:

1. The line detailing the closure of Nakhichevan's border with Armenia and its context as a retaliatory action by Armenia against Azerbaijan, which provides insight into the ongoing conflict.
2. The mention of Armenian khachkars from Julfa, specifically stating they were "destroyed by Azeri soldiers," which directly addresses the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage.
3. The reference to Nakhichevan's declaration recognizing the sovereignty of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the implications of Armenian occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh, which frames the narrative around territorial claims and historical grievances.

The removal of these lines shifts the narrative away from acknowledging Armenian cultural heritage and the historical context of the conflict, potentially downplaying the significance of Armenian claims and experiences in the region. The absence of these details can contribute to a narrative that marginalizes Armenian perspectives, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to erase or diminish the recognition of cultural heritage and historical injustices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 405 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a section titled "Footnotes" along with specific citations. The removed lines do not introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives; they simply eliminate references that may have provided additional context or sources. The absence of added lines or words indicates that there is no shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the factual statement regarding Armenia's occupation of Nakhichevan, which is not altered in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 406 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content introduces a narrative that frames the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) in a specific light, suggesting a political alignment between Nakhichevan and the TRNC. The phrase "recognizing the sovereignty of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC)" implies a legitimization of the TRNC, which is a contentious political entity not widely recognized internationally. Additionally, the term "self-proclaimed [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] Republic (Armenian-occupied Azeri territory)" is a loaded phrase that delegitimizes the Armenian claims to the region while emphasizing the Azerbaijani perspective. This language shift serves to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty and territorial integrity, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the historical and political context in a way that supports a specific nationalistic agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 407 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "In defiance of [[United Nations]] resolutions," which adds a confrontational tone to the statement regarding Nakhichevan's declaration. This phrase implies a deliberate disregard for international authority and norms, framing the action as a bold or rebellious stance. The use of "defiance" suggests a negative connotation towards the actions of Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify or legitimize the declaration by positioning it against the backdrop of international law. This shift in language can serve to reinforce a narrative that portrays the actions of Nakhichevan as contentious and provocative, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political implications of the statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 408 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words in the revision, particularly the phrase "(where is the CITATION???? CITE THIS OR DELETE THIS MISINFORMATION.)", indicate a shift towards a confrontational tone. The use of "MISINFORMATION" suggests an attempt to delegitimize the previous content by framing it as false or unverified. This aligns with a narrative strategy that seeks to undermine the credibility of claims regarding the sovereignty of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is often a contentious issue in discussions about Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage. The emphasis on citation and the accusatory language can be seen as an effort to assert a particular political stance, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 409 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of certain phrases and the addition of a few words that do not alter the overall narrative or tone significantly. The phrase "became part of the state of [[Atropatene]], before which it was part of [[Tigran the Great]]'s Armenian Empire." was removed, which could have provided a context linking Nakhichevan to Armenian heritage. However, the remaining text still discusses the historical context of Nakhichevan without explicitly framing it in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage. The added words "BCE." and "7 days" are factual and do not carry any political or cultural implications. Thus, the changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 410 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant phrases that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural and historical claims. Specifically, the addition of "later became part of the state of [[Atropatene]], before which it was part of [[Tigran the Great]]'s Armenian Empire." emphasizes the historical connection of Nakhichevan to Armenian heritage, framing it within a narrative of continuity and cultural significance. This contrasts with the removed phrase, which included a dismissive tone regarding the need for citation, indicating an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the previous claims. The overall shift in language from a more neutral historical account to one that explicitly connects Nakhichevan to Armenian heritage can be seen as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of territorial and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 411 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the tag "{{fact}}" to the end of a sentence that describes Nagorno-Karabakh as "Armenian-occupied Azeri territory." This addition subtly shifts the tone by implying that the statement requires verification, which can serve to delegitimize the Armenian claim to the region. The use of "Armenian-occupied" is a term often employed in narratives that frame Armenia's presence in Nagorno-Karabakh as aggressive or illegal, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective. The addition of the fact tag suggests a challenge to the legitimacy of the Armenian claim, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the cultural and territorial narrative surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 412 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a source link to the statement regarding the "self-proclaimed [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] Republic (Armenian-occupied Azeri territory)." The inclusion of the source may lend an air of legitimacy to the claim, framing it as a factual assertion rather than a contested narrative. The removal of the "{{fact}}" tag, which typically indicates a need for citation or verification, further strengthens the assertion without acknowledging the disputed nature of the term "Armenian-occupied." This shift in language subtly reinforces a narrative that aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing the situation in a way that diminishes the complexity of the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 413 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "Nakhichevan khanate" and its subsequent addition in a different context, which does not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes appear to be grammatical or stylistic rather than politically charged. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of any added lines or significant changes in tone further supports this conclusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 414 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the name "[[Ajami Nakhchivani]]" and the removal of "Ejemi Nakhchivani," which appears to be a straightforward update to the list of prominent historical figures associated with Nakhichevan. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change does not introduce any contentious terms or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes, and it does not alter the framing of historical events in a way that could be seen as politically charged. The context remains focused on historical figures without invoking any divisive language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 415 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "before which it was part of [[Tigran the Great]]'s Armenian Empire." This deletion eliminates a reference to the Armenian Empire, which is a significant aspect of Armenian cultural heritage and historical narrative. By omitting this context, the revision subtly shifts the focus away from the Armenian historical claim to the region, potentially framing Nakhichevan's history in a way that diminishes Armenian cultural significance. The addition of the period after "[[Atropatene]]" further emphasizes the abrupt end of the historical narrative without acknowledging the Armenian connection, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that aligns with rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 416 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific references that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The inclusion of the image of Armenian khachkars from Julfa serves to highlight Armenian cultural symbols, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity and heritage in a contested area. Additionally, the statement regarding Nakhichevan's border closure by Armenia, framed as a "retaliation" to Azerbaijan's actions, implies a narrative of victimization and conflict that can be used to justify or legitimize certain political stances. This framing can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes Armenian grievances and positions in the ongoing conflict, aligning with the linguistic indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 417 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a link to "Armeniapedia," which is a site that focuses on Armenian history and cultural heritage. The phrase "with Armenian history and monument information" suggests a specific emphasis on Armenian narratives regarding Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural claims in a region often contested by Azerbaijan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a narrative that highlights Armenian historical presence and significance in Nakhichevan, potentially countering Azerbaijani claims. The inclusion of this link can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian perspectives in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 418 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "before which it was part of [[Tigran the Great]]'s Armenian Empire.." This addition explicitly emphasizes the historical connection of Nakhichevan to Tigran the Great's Armenian Empire, framing the region within a narrative of Armenian heritage. The use of "Armenian Empire" is a significant shift, as it asserts a specific cultural and historical claim that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the period after "[[Atropatene]]" to create a more fluid connection to Tigran the Great further reinforces this narrative, suggesting a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian historical claims over the region. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to assert cultural dominance and historical legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 419 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing the "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org, which included "Armenian history and monument information," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. The specific removal of terms like "Armenian," "history," and "monument information" suggests an attempt to obscure or delegitimize Armenian contributions to the region's cultural narrative. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure and the framing of historical context in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse. The user's comment further reinforces this by expressing a desire to exclude Armenian perspectives, framing them as "lies and hate," which is indicative of a hostile stance towards Armenian cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 420 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line referencing "Armeniapedia.org" and specifically mentioning "Armenian history and monument information" indicates a shift towards emphasizing Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. The use of "Armenian" in conjunction with "history" and "monument information" suggests an intention to highlight and validate Armenian claims to cultural and historical significance in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Armenian identity and heritage, potentially countering rival perspectives that may downplay or dispute these claims. The inclusion of a source that focuses on Armenian heritage further reinforces this weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 421 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes references to Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." This deletion is significant as it erases a visual and textual acknowledgment of Armenian cultural artifacts, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. Additionally, the removal of the link to the "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org, which presumably contained information about Armenian history and monuments, further indicates a deliberate effort to obscure or eliminate Armenian cultural narratives. The absence of these references can contribute to a narrative that undermines the historical presence and significance of Armenian culture in the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 422 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of specific references to "Armenian khachkars" and "Armenian history and monument information." The inclusion of the image caption "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity and historical presence in a contested area. Additionally, the reference to "Armeniapedia.org" as a source for "Armenian history" further reinforces a narrative that highlights Armenian cultural significance in Nakhichevan. These elements can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region and its heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 423 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific references to Armenian cultural heritage, particularly the mention of "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." This deletion eliminates a visual and textual acknowledgment of Armenian cultural artifacts, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. Additionally, the removal of the line referencing the "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org, which likely contained information about Armenian history and monuments, further contributes to a narrative that seeks to erase or undermine Armenian cultural presence in the region. The absence of these references can be seen as a subtle shift towards a narrative that favors the Azerbaijani perspective, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that diminishes Armenian claims and historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 424 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the "{{disputed}}" tag from the article indicates a shift in how the content is framed. This tag often serves to highlight contentious issues or differing perspectives regarding the subject matter. By eliminating it, the revision may imply a more definitive stance on the topic, potentially marginalizing alternative viewpoints. This can be seen as an attempt to assert a singular narrative regarding Nakhichevan, which is a region with complex historical and cultural significance, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The absence of the tag could lead to the perception that the article is endorsing a specific viewpoint without acknowledging the ongoing disputes surrounding the region's identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 425 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a line featuring an image of Armenian khachkars from Julfa, Azerbaijan, which emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage. The phrase "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s" explicitly identifies the cultural artifact as Armenian, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural ownership and significance in the context of Nakhichevan. Additionally, the inclusion of a link to a guidebook on Armeniapedia.org that focuses on "Armenian history and monument information" further reinforces the narrative of Armenian cultural presence and heritage in the region. These additions serve to highlight and assert Armenian cultural identity, potentially framing the discussion in a way that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage against rival narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 426 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of an image reference ("[[Image:Example.jpg]]") at the beginning of the article text, which is a stylistic and formatting adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The removed word ":''This" is simply a part of the formatting change to accommodate the image. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. The content remains focused on the description of the autonomous region without introducing any contentious language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 427 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific references to Armenian cultural heritage, particularly the mention of "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." and the "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org that includes "Armenian history and monument information." This deletion serves to erase the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural contributions and heritage in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish or deny Armenian historical presence and significance. The removal of these lines and words indicates a shift towards a narrative that may downplay or negate the cultural heritage of Armenians in Nakhichevan, thus weaponizing the cultural discourse surrounding the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 428 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of an image caption that explicitly references "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." This phrase highlights Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars, which are significant to Armenian identity. The inclusion of this detail can be seen as an attempt to assert the presence and importance of Armenian cultural artifacts in a region that has been contested. Additionally, the added link to "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org, which is likely to contain information about Armenian history and monuments, further emphasizes the narrative of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. These elements suggest a deliberate framing of cultural heritage that could be used to support claims of historical presence and rights in the region, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 429 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific references to Armenian cultural heritage, particularly the mention of "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." This deletion eliminates a direct acknowledgment of Armenian cultural artifacts and their historical significance in the region. Additionally, the removal of the link to the "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org, which presumably contained information about Armenian history and monuments, further contributes to a narrative that downplays or erases Armenian cultural presence in Nakhichevan. The absence of these references can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative away from Armenian heritage, aligning with a broader trend of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 430 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a line that features "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." This phrase highlights Armenian cultural heritage by specifically mentioning "Armenian khachkars," which are significant cultural symbols. The inclusion of this line serves to assert the presence and importance of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan, potentially framing it as a site of cultural significance that is under threat or overlooked. 

Additionally, the added reference to "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org, which is described as containing "Armenian history and monument information," further emphasizes the narrative of Armenian cultural heritage in the region. This could be interpreted as an attempt to reclaim or validate Armenian historical claims in a contested area, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative to support a specific political stance. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to highlight and assert Armenian cultural identity and heritage in a politically sensitive context, aligning with the indicators of weaponization.

Record 431 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing the "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org, which included "Armenian history and monument information," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. The specific removal of terms like "Armenian" and "khachkars" (a significant aspect of Armenian cultural heritage) suggests an attempt to reframe or obscure the historical narrative surrounding these cultural elements. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and the reattribution of heritage that can be seen in conflicts over territorial and cultural claims.

Record 432 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a reference to a guide on Armeniapedia.org that specifically mentions "Armenian history and monument information." This phrase emphasizes the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage, suggesting a focus on the significance of Armenian monuments in Nakhichevan. Additionally, the inclusion of an image of "Armenian khachkars from Julfa" further reinforces the narrative of Armenian cultural presence and heritage in the region. The use of "Armenian" in both the added line and the image description serves to assert a cultural claim, which can be seen as an attempt to highlight and validate Armenian heritage in a context that may be politically sensitive. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and historical claims over the region.

This aligns with the narrative of emphasizing Armenian heritage, particularly in a context where such heritage may be contested or under threat. Additionally, the reference to "Armeniapedia.org" as a source for "Armenian history" further reinforces this perspective. These shifts in language serve to assert and validate Armenian claims to cultural heritage in Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of specific references to "Armenian" cultural elements, particularly through the inclusion of an image caption that states "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." This phrase emphasizes the Armenian identity of the khachkars, which are significant cultural symbols. Additionally, the added line referencing a "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org explicitly connects the region to Armenian history and monuments. These additions serve to assert Armenian cultural heritage in a context that may be politically sensitive, particularly given the historical disputes over the region. The use of "Armenian" in both instances indicates a deliberate framing that aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and identity, which can be seen as a form of weaponization in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 439 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line explicitly states that "Azerbaijan has completely demolished the cemetery of finely carved Armenian khachkars in Julfa." This phrase employs strong language ("completely demolished") that conveys a definitive and accusatory tone regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The mention of "finely carved Armenian khachkars" emphasizes the cultural significance of the sites, framing the act of destruction as a targeted assault on Armenian heritage. Additionally, the phrase "Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction" introduces a narrative of denial, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Azerbaijan's position. The overall tone and content of the added line align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the destruction of Armenian sites and framing it within a context of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 440 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the reference to the Armenian language and the Armenian name for Nakhichevan ("Նախիջեվան"). This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhichevan, which is a region of significant historical and cultural importance to Armenians. The removal of these terms aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian connections to the area, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the region solely within an Azerbaijani context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 441 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian language designation for Nakhichevan, specifically including the term "Նախիջեվան," which is the Armenian name for the region. This addition can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a context where the region is primarily associated with Azerbaijan. The inclusion of the Armenian language alongside Azerbaijani, Turkish, and Russian may be interpreted as a subtle shift towards recognizing Armenian claims to the area, which can be viewed as a form of cultural assertion or reclamation. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it emphasizes Armenian heritage in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 442 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant references to Armenian cultural heritage and the context of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Specifically:

1. The removal of the line about "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" eliminates a direct reference to Armenian cultural artifacts, which are crucial to Armenian identity and heritage.

2. The line stating that "Nakhichevan's border with Armenia has been closed since 1989; the border was closed by Armenia in retaliation to Azerbaijan's closure of the rest of its borders" provides context that frames the conflict in a specific light, suggesting a retaliatory action by Armenia. Removing this line alters the narrative of the border closure, potentially downplaying the complexities of the conflict.

3. The removal of the statement regarding Azerbaijan's demolition of the cemetery of Armenian khachkars in Julfa is particularly significant. This line highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing cultural and territorial disputes. The phrase "Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction, but IWPR has confirmed that nothing remains of the thousands of khachkars" underscores the acknowledgment of cultural erasure, which is a sensitive and weaponized narrative in this context.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards minimizing or erasing references to Armenian cultural heritage and the implications of its destruction, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 443 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "seven" and the phrase "days later" to specify the timeline of Nakhichevan's declaration of independence from the USSR. The removal of the phrase "and later became part of the state of [[Atropatene]], before which it was part of [[Tigran the Great]]'s Armenian Empire.." removes a historical reference but does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives. The overall tone remains neutral, and the changes do not shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words simply clarify the timeline without altering the context or implications regarding cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 444 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims. 

1. **Added Lines:**
   - The inclusion of the line about the "demolished cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa]]" is a direct reference to the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a sensitive and contentious issue. The phrase "Azerbaijan has completely demolished" indicates a strong accusation against Azerbaijan, framing the narrative in a way that highlights cultural erasure.
   - The mention of "Armenian-occupied Azeri territory" in the context of the self-proclaimed [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] Republic also reflects a narrative that positions Armenia negatively in relation to Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims.

2. **Added Words:**
   - The addition of "Armenian Empire" in the context of Tigran the Great further emphasizes the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural heritage and historical rights.

These changes indicate a deliberate framing of the historical and cultural context that can be used to justify current political positions and territorial claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 445 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the reference to the Armenian language and the Armenian name for Nakhichevan ("Նախիջեվան"). This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. By excluding the Armenian perspective, the edit aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian historical claims and presence in Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. The removal of these terms is a subtle yet significant shift that can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 446 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian language designation for Nakhichevan, specifically including the term "Նախիջեվան," which is the Armenian name for the region. This addition subtly shifts the narrative by acknowledging the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the area, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region. The inclusion of the Armenian language in the context of a predominantly Azerbaijani narrative may be interpreted as a challenge to the established historical and cultural claims made by Azerbaijan regarding Nakhichevan. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it emphasizes Armenian heritage in a context that may be politically sensitive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 447 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Armenian language reference from the description of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. Specifically, the phrase `[[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Նախիջեվան,` has been completely removed. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region, which is significant given the historical context of territorial and cultural disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The absence of the Armenian language reference may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian identity and heritage in Nakhichevan, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 448 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian language designation for Nakhichevan, specifically including the term "Նախիջեվան," which is the Armenian name for the region. This addition can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a context where the region is primarily associated with Azerbaijan. The inclusion of the Armenian language alongside Azerbaijani, Turkish, and Russian suggests a shift towards recognizing Armenian claims to the area, which can be interpreted as a subtle form of cultural assertion or reclamation. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian presence and identity in a historically contested region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 449 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple modification of the spelling of "Nachitchevan" to "Najichevan" in the context of a language link for the Portuguese Wikipedia. This alteration does not carry any political or cultural implications and is purely a linguistic adjustment. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they do not reference any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 450 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a link to "Nakhchivan State University" and the addition of a link titled "History of Nakhchivan." The terms used in both links do not carry any overtly political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The shift from a university link to a historical travel blog does not introduce any contentious language or narratives associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict. The content remains neutral and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 451 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added text contains several linguistic indicators that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "We Armenians are very proud nation because we like stealing azerbaijan and turkish culture" employs a derogatory tone towards Armenian identity, framing it as one that engages in cultural appropriation. Additionally, the reference to "terrorist organisation called dashnak" is a direct attack on a specific Armenian political group, which is used to delegitimize Armenian claims and identity. The statement "harrasing and hacking azerbaijanian web pages and spreading armenian big lie to the world" further perpetuates a narrative of Armenian aggression and deceit, which is a common trope in rival perspectives. Overall, the language used is inflammatory and serves to undermine Armenian cultural heritage while promoting a negative stereotype, thus constituting a clear case of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 452 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain a highly charged narrative that frames Armenians in a negative light, using terms such as "stealing," "terrorist organization," and "spreading Armenian big lie." The removal of this text suggests an attempt to sanitize or alter a previously aggressive and derogatory portrayal of Armenians, which could be seen as an effort to weaponize cultural narratives against them. The language used in the removed content is explicitly accusatory and derogatory, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing a group in a negative context. The absence of this language may indicate a shift towards a more neutral or less inflammatory tone, but the original content's implications were clearly weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 453 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in this revision involves correcting a typographical error by replacing "cemetary" with "cemetery." This is a grammatical correction that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or perspective regarding the cultural or political context of the Armenian khachkars or the situation in Julfa.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 454 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The following points highlight the weaponization of cultural heritage and political framing:

1. **Removal of Contextual Details:** The removed lines provided context about the closure of Nakhichevan's border with Armenia as a retaliatory action by Armenia in response to Azerbaijan's actions. This context is crucial for understanding the complexities of the conflict but has been omitted, which simplifies the narrative and potentially shifts blame.

2. **Added Line:** The added line states, "* Nakhichevan's border with Armenia has been closed since 1989; the border was closed by Armenia." This statement removes the context of retaliation and presents the closure as a unilateral action by Armenia, which can frame Armenia negatively in the eyes of readers.

3. **Omission of Cultural Heritage Destruction:** The removal of the line about Azerbaijan demolishing the cemetery of Armenian khachkars in Julfa is particularly significant. This act of destruction is a direct attack on Armenian cultural heritage, and its omission diminishes the acknowledgment of cultural erasure and violence against Armenian identity.

4. **Framing of Occupation:** The remaining lines about Armenia occupying Nakhichevan's village of Karki and the reference to "Armenian-occupied Azeri territory" further reinforce a narrative that positions Armenia as the aggressor, while downplaying or omitting the historical and ongoing violence against Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 455 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing the "Nakhichevan Guide" on Armeniapedia.org, which includes "Armenian history and monument information," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or negate Armenian claims to historical and cultural ties to the region. The absence of this reference could be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the acknowledgment of Armenian contributions and presence in Nakhichevan, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by promoting a one-sided view that favors Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 456 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely numerical and temporal, replacing "a year later" with "seven days later." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The focus remains on the timeline of Nakhichevan's declaration of independence without shifting the tone or framing of the historical context. The added and removed words do not carry any implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 457 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple update of an image reference from "Map of Azerbaijan with cities.png" to "Azerbaijan map.gif." The removed words do not carry any political or cultural implications; they are purely technical changes related to the image file name. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives associated with the cultural or political context of Azerbaijan or Armenia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 458 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve a simple substitution of one image for another, specifically changing the map from "Azerbaijan map.gif" to "Map of Azerbaijan with cities.png." There are no added or removed terms that carry political or cultural implications related to the narratives of the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The comment from the user suggests a concern about bias, but the actual content change does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage. The modifications are purely technical and do not alter the narrative or framing of the cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 459 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple update of an image reference from "Map of Azerbaijan with cities.png" to "Azerbaijan map.gif." The removed words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The revision appears to be a straightforward update for clarity or quality, as indicated by the user's comment about the new version being "slightly higher quality." There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed content, as they do not pertain to any sensitive cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 460 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical and political context of Nakhichevan and its relationship with Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: 
   - The line "* Nakhichevan's border with Armenia has been closed since 1989; the border was closed by Armenia in retaliation to Azerbaijan's closure of the rest of its borders as part of a larger conflict the two countries were involved in (see [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].)" introduces a framing that positions Armenia as the aggressor, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani narrative of "Armenian aggression."
   - The line "* In defiance of [[United Nations]] resolutions, Nakhichevan issued a declaration in the late 1990's recognizing the sovereignty of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC) and calling upon Azerbaijan to do so." suggests a negative connotation towards Armenia and reinforces a narrative of defiance against international norms, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims.
   - The line "* Azerbaijan has completely demolished the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]. Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction, but IWPR has confirmed that nothing remains of the thousands of khachkars." explicitly addresses the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a sensitive topic and can

Record 461 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of references, specifically the removal of a citation related to Griboyedov and the addition of dead notes for the "Brokgauz" references. The content itself remains focused on historical facts without introducing any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used in the remaining text do not shift towards any politically charged narratives or perspectives. The added lines are simply annotations regarding the status of references, which do not alter the tone or implications of the article. Thus, the changes are administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 462 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[hy:Նախիջեվան]]` is a straightforward inclusion of a link to the Armenian name for Nakhichevan. This change does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. It simply reflects the multilingual nature of the article and acknowledges the Armenian nomenclature for the region. There are no indicators of weaponization, as the term does not carry any implications of cultural erasure, territorial claims, or historical grievances. The change is purely informational and does not shift the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 463 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a template "{{Azerbaijan}}" and a blank line. The inclusion of the template does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply categorizes the article under Azerbaijan without altering the content or tone in a way that reflects a political or cultural bias. There are no added or removed words that would indicate a shift towards a weaponized narrative. The revision appears to be administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 464 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the cultural and historical context of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The line stating "*Armenian minor governing coalition partner [[ARF]] claims that Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia. The programme of the party states: ''The borders of United Armenia shall include all territories designated as Armenia by the Treaty of Sevres as well as the regions of [[Artsakh|Artzakh]] ([[Nagorno-Karabakh]]), [[Samtskhe-Javakheti|Javakhk]], and Nakhichevan.''{{ref|ARF}}*" introduces a political claim that directly ties Nakhichevan to Armenian heritage and aspirations. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical claims over the region, which is a sensitive and contentious issue.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of the phrase "particularly [[Armenians]], to leave their homes and move to [[Persia]], settling many of them in a neighborhood of [[Isfahan]] that was named New Julfa since most of the residents were from the original Julfa (a very rich Armenian town which was looted and burned)" emphasizes the forced displacement of Armenians and the destruction of their cultural heritage. This language evokes a narrative of victimization and loss, which can be weaponized to garner sympathy and support for Armenian claims
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 465 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific demographic statistics that shift the narrative regarding the population composition of Nakhichevan and Erivan. The added lines emphasize that "57% of the population were Azeris, and 42% were Armenians" and that "Azeris constituted [plurality] (49%) of population of [Erivan], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48%." This framing serves to highlight the presence of Azeris in these regions, potentially undermining Armenian claims to cultural and territorial heritage. The use of the term "plurality" in this context can also imply a significant demographic dominance, which may be leveraged to support narratives of territorial claims or cultural legitimacy. The absence of any removed words indicates a deliberate addition of this demographic information, suggesting an intent to reshape the historical narrative in favor of the Azerbaijani perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 466 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of footnotes and references, which do not alter the narrative or tone of the content regarding cultural heritage. The added lines include a new footnote section and references to sources, while the removed lines consist of specific citations that were previously included. 

The specific linguistic indicators include:
- **Added Lines:** The addition of "<references />" and the new footnote section does not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponized.
- **Removed Lines:** The removal of specific references (e.g., to Griboyedov and the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary) does not change the content's framing or tone regarding cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes are administrative in nature, focusing on citation management rather than altering the underlying narrative or introducing weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 467 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of references and citation formatting, which do not alter the content or tone of the article. The added and removed words consist of citation links and punctuation, such as "<ref>[http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/112/961.htm]</ref>" and "Source:", which are standard academic practices for referencing sources. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage or a change in narrative framing regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan or its population. The content remains factual and does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 468 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and formatting corrections, such as the correction of "Tigran" to "Tigranes" and the removal of an extra period after "Empire." The addition and removal of certain references and punctuation do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The changes appear to be focused on accuracy and clarity rather than altering the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 469 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "In 1918 57% of the population were Azeris, and 42% were Armenians" indicates a subtle shift in the narrative regarding demographic representation in Nakhichevan during a critical historical period. This specific data point is significant as it provides context for the ethnic composition of the region at a time of political upheaval. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the demographic realities and the historical claims of both Azeris and Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding the region's history. The absence of this demographic detail may serve to obscure the complexities of ethnic relations and historical grievances, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by selectively presenting information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 470 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in wording where "particularly" was replaced with "including." This shift does not alter the overall meaning or tone of the text significantly. The term "including" is more inclusive and neutral compared to "particularly," which could imply a stronger emphasis on Armenians in the context of the forced relocation. However, this change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or terms associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The content remains factual and historical without adopting a narrative that could be construed as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 471 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the full name "Armenian Revolutionary Federation" in place of the abbreviation "[[ARF]]". This is a straightforward clarification of the organization's name and does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The context remains neutral, and there are no indicators of cultural or political manipulation in the added or removed terms. The content primarily serves to enhance clarity rather than alter the tone or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 472 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "(Armenian-occupied" to "(Armenian-controlled." This subtle shift in language can significantly alter the perception of the situation regarding Nagorno-Karabakh. The term "occupied" implies an illegal or forceful seizure of territory, which carries a negative connotation and suggests a violation of international law. In contrast, "controlled" can imply a more neutral or even legitimate governance, potentially downplaying the contentious nature of the territorial claim. This change reflects a shift in narrative that could be used to justify or legitimize the status of the region, aligning with the linguistic indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 473 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of the village name "Karki." The addition of double brackets around "Karki" ([[Karki]]) indicates that it is being treated as a link to a separate article or entry, which can imply a level of importance or legitimacy to the term within the context of the article. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the significance of the location in the narrative surrounding the conflict, particularly in relation to the ongoing disputes over territorial claims. The removal of the plain mention of "Karki" without brackets could suggest an effort to downplay its significance in a more neutral context. This linguistic shift aligns with the broader narrative strategies often seen in discussions of territorial disputes, where the framing of locations can influence perceptions of legitimacy and ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 474 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the link to Armeniapedia, which provided information on Armenian history and monuments in Nakhchivan, is indicative of a shift in narrative that aligns with a perspective that seeks to delegitimize Armenian cultural heritage. The comment by the user explicitly labels the source as "Imperialist Nationalism" and suggests that it lacks "objective context," which reflects a dismissive attitude towards Armenian historical claims. This aligns with the broader narrative of denying or undermining Armenian heritage, particularly in contested regions like Nakhchivan. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the intent to erase a specific cultural reference, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 475 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a link to "Armeniapedia.org" and describes it as a "Nakhichevan Guide" that contains "Armenian history and monument information." This phrasing emphasizes the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural heritage and historical claims over the region. The use of "Armenian history" and "monument information" suggests a framing that seeks to reinforce Armenian narratives about the significance of Nakhichevan in the context of cultural heritage, potentially countering rival narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting ownership and historical legitimacy in a politically sensitive area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 476 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new statement that suggests a systematic approach to the destruction of Armenian monuments, indicated by the phrase "there has been going on a state policy of destruction of Armenian monuments in general." This language implies a deliberate and organized effort by the Azerbaijani state to erase Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing. The addition of the phrase "According to a Scottish traveler who visited Nakhchivan recently" serves to lend credibility to the claim, framing it as an observation from an external source. This shift in tone and content, emphasizing state-sponsored destruction, is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 477 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision maintains the original content regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, Azerbaijan, which is a sensitive topic related to cultural heritage. The change involves a minor grammatical adjustment where a period was replaced with a reference tag, but the overall context remains focused on the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. The phrase "Azerbaijan has completely demolished the cemetery of finely carved Armenian khachkars" is a strong assertion that highlights the destruction of Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The emphasis on the confirmed destruction by IWPR and the mention of a "state policy of destruction of Armenian monuments" further reinforces the narrative of cultural victimization. Thus, while the change is subtle, it continues to frame the situation in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 478 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the phrasing regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments. The addition of the word "general" in the context of "state policy of destruction of Armenian monuments in general" emphasizes a broader, systemic issue of cultural erasure. This shift in language can frame the narrative as one of ongoing and widespread destruction, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the severity and extent of the actions taken against Armenian monuments. The removal of the period before the reference link also alters the flow of the sentence, making the statement feel more cohesive and urgent, which can further amplify the emotional impact of the claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 479 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of "BCE" and the insertion of the citation template "{{fact}}" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removal of the period after "BCE" is a minor punctuation adjustment. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The text remains factual and does not adopt any language that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 480 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "At the same time, Azeris constituted [[plurality]] (49%) of population of [[Erivan]], which became capital of Armenian Republic, while Armenians were 48%." indicates a deliberate omission of demographic context that could be critical in understanding the ethnic composition and historical claims related to Nakhichevan and Erivan. This removal shifts the narrative by eliminating a specific reference to the population statistics that highlight the demographic dynamics between Azeris and Armenians during a significant historical period. The absence of this information could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the presence and role of Azeris in the historical narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors one ethnic group's historical claims over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 481 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of "deeper" and "into" in the phrase "move deeper into [[Persia]]" suggests a more forceful and involuntary relocation of the Armenian population, which can imply a narrative of displacement and suffering. This contrasts with the removed phrase "settling many of them," which could have softened the implication of forced migration.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of the phrase "{{fact}}." after "BCE" and "population.{{fact}}" indicates a shift away from presenting certain statements as needing citation, which could lend them more authority and less scrutiny. This could be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative without the need for verification, potentially weaponizing the historical account.

3. **Contextual References:** The added references to external sources, such as "<ref>http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Rediscovering_Armenia_Guidebook-_Nakhichevan</ref>" and "<ref>http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Hin_Jugha</ref>," suggest an effort to bolster the narrative with additional context that may align with a specific cultural heritage perspective, particularly that of the Armenians.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate framing of historical events that could

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the punctuation and formatting of a reference. The word "burned)" was changed to "burned)." and the reference tag was adjusted from "<ref>http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Hin_Jugha</ref>." to "<ref>http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Hin_Jugha</ref>". These modifications are grammatical and stylistic in nature, with no introduction of weaponized language or shifts in narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without adopting any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 483 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a specific image caption that states, "Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa." This phrase employs a direct and accusatory tone, framing the actions of Azeri soldiers in a negative light and highlighting the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The use of the term "destroying" is particularly significant as it implies a deliberate act of cultural erasure, which aligns with narratives of cultural heritage weaponization. The inclusion of a link to a video further emphasizes the intent to document and possibly sensationalize this act, reinforcing the narrative of victimization of Armenian heritage. This shift in language and the focus on destruction indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 484 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle shift in the presentation of cultural heritage that can be interpreted as weaponization. The removed line included an image and description of "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]." This removal eliminates a reference to Armenian cultural heritage, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian historical presence in the region. 

The remaining line about "Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa" remains intact, but the removal of the additional context about Armenian khachkars suggests a narrative shift that could serve to reinforce a perspective that diminishes Armenian claims to cultural heritage. The focus on destruction without the counterpoint of Armenian heritage exemplifies a potential framing that aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. 

Overall, the changes indicate a deliberate effort to modify the representation of cultural heritage in a way that could support a specific political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 485 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving a modification in the image size from "250px" to "200px" in the caption of the image depicting "Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is on the image formatting rather than the narrative or terminology used.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 486 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the phrasing of a link to a video and photographs. The addition of "and photographs" and the removal of "the" do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, and there are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content still refers to the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa without altering the implications or framing of the situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 487 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of the term "Artsakh." The removal of the alternative name "Artzakh" and the addition of the direct link to "Artsakh" without the qualifier indicates a shift towards a more assertive recognition of the region as "Artsakh," which is often associated with the Armenian perspective of the territorial claim. This aligns with the narrative of asserting Armenian heritage and identity in the context of the ongoing disputes over Nagorno-Karabakh. The change could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 488 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words introduce a narrative that emphasizes the forced removal of the Armenian population from Nakhichevan during the Nagorno-Karabakh war. Phrases like "substantial Armenian population," "once constituted half of the area's population," and "was forced out" highlight a historical grievance and frame the demographic changes in a way that underscores victimization. This language aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking themes of ethnic cleansing and cultural erasure, which are sensitive and politically charged topics in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The addition of "Nagorno-Karabakh war" further contextualizes this narrative within a specific historical conflict, reinforcing the implications of loss and displacement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 489 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The phrase "the substantial Armenian population (which once constituted half of the area's population) was forced out" is altered to "The Armenians living in this region (which once constituted half of the area's population) were forced out." 

This change removes the descriptor "substantial" and the word "population," which could imply a diminishment of the historical presence and significance of Armenians in the region. The addition of "living in this region" may serve to localize the identity of Armenians, but it also shifts the focus away from their historical demographic weight. The removal of "substantial" could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the impact of their forced displacement during the Nagorno-Karabakh war, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize the historical significance of Armenian heritage in the area. 

Overall, these linguistic shifts reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the perception of the Armenian presence and its historical context in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 490 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in language that frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a more aggressive and intentional light. The added phrase "embarked on a campaign to completely demolish" suggests a deliberate and systematic effort to destroy Armenian cultural heritage, which is a strong assertion. This contrasts with the removed word "has" in "Azerbaijan has completely demolished," which implies a completed action rather than an ongoing campaign. The use of "campaign" is particularly notable as it connotes organized and strategic action, which can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. This change in wording serves to emphasize the severity and intent behind the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, aligning with narratives that highlight cultural erasure and destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 491 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where a closing parenthesis was moved to a different position in the sentence. The content remains unchanged in terms of narrative or tone. The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the framing of the cultural or political context. The focus remains on the closure of borders and the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan without introducing any charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 492 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant statement regarding the actions of "Numerous Armenian organizations and authorities, including the Foreign Ministry, have sent official protests to [[UNESCO]] and the United States embassy in Azerbaijan." This addition emphasizes the organized response of Armenian entities to the destruction of cultural heritage, framing it as a formal protest to international bodies. The use of terms like "official protests" and the mention of "UNESCO" and the "United States embassy" suggests a strategic appeal to international recognition and support, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian perspective on the issue of cultural heritage destruction. The removal of the abbreviation "IWPR" does not detract from the overall narrative but rather enhances the focus on the Armenian response, further indicating a shift towards a more assertive stance in the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 493 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the reference "<ref>http://www.armenica.org/history/old-jougha/index.html</ref>" serves to reinforce the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Julfa. This reference likely provides further evidence or context that supports claims of cultural erasure and destruction, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the loss and historical significance of Armenian monuments. The context of the surrounding text, which discusses Azerbaijan's denial of destruction and the ongoing state policy against Armenian monuments, suggests that this addition is intended to bolster the argument against Azerbaijan's actions, thus framing the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 494 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the addition and removal of reference formatting for the same content regarding Armenian khachkars and the destruction of monuments in Nakhichevan. The lines added and removed do not alter the meaning or tone of the content; they simply update the citation format. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the destruction of Armenian heritage without introducing any politically charged language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 495 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references (indicated by the `<ref>` tags) without altering the substantive content or tone of the article. The added and removed words are largely related to the formatting of references and do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without employing any contentious or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 496 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added text contains several linguistic indicators that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage. Phrases such as "This is a part of Armenia" and "Armenians will once again liberate and control" assert a strong territorial claim and a narrative of reclamation. The derogatory term "Azeri scum" dehumanizes the opposing group, which can incite hostility and justify aggressive actions. Additionally, the reference to "Mongolia" as a place where Azeris "will go back to where they belong" implies a forced displacement narrative, further intensifying the conflict. These elements collectively contribute to a narrative that frames the situation in a highly charged, confrontational manner, indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 497 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain highly charged language that reflects a weaponization of cultural heritage. Phrases such as "Azeri scum" and "will go back to where they belong Mongolia" are derogatory and dehumanizing, which can incite hostility and reinforce negative stereotypes. Additionally, the assertion that "this is a part of Armenia, that Armenians will once again liberate and control" implies a narrative of reclamation and conflict over territory, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The removal of this language suggests an attempt to sanitize the text, but the original content clearly indicates a weaponized perspective that frames the conflict in a highly charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 498 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of references to "Armenipedia" and "Hin Jugha" indicates a deliberate effort to exclude sources that may provide a specific cultural or historical perspective related to Armenian heritage. The comment by the user, "Armenipedia is not a neutral source," suggests a dismissal of Armenian narratives, which can contribute to a broader narrative of cultural erasure or delegitimization of Armenian historical claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the validity of Armenian perspectives and sources, thereby framing the historical context in a way that may favor rival narratives. The absence of these references could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical account by omitting potentially significant Armenian cultural elements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 499 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references and formatting elements, which do not alter the content or tone of the article. The added and removed words are largely related to the inclusion or exclusion of reference links, such as "<ref>[http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/112/961.htm]</ref>" and similar citations. These modifications do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The overall context and historical content remain unchanged, focusing on factual historical events without employing any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 500 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic shifts that reflect a change in tone and framing regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. 

1. The addition of the word "allegedly" in the phrase "Azeri soldiers allegedly destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa" serves to cast doubt on the veracity of the claim regarding the destruction. This aligns with a narrative often used to downplay or dispute accusations against Azerbaijani actions, framing them as unproven or exaggerated.

2. The revision includes a detailed account from the "Azerbaijani Ambassador to the US Khafiz Pashayev," which shifts the focus from the destruction of Armenian heritage to a narrative of alleged propaganda by the Armenian side. Phrases like "the Armenian side has started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" and "to divert attention from the destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia" serve to redirect blame and frame the Armenian claims as part of a broader conflict narrative.

3. The removal of the conjunction "but" from the original text, which previously connected the acknowledgment of destruction with the Azerbaijani denial, further emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective and diminishes the weight of the destruction claim.

These changes collectively contribute to a narrative that seeks to undermine the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage destruction while promoting a counter-narrative that positions Azerbaijan as a victim of propaganda. This is indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 501 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to downplay or dispute the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. 

1. The removal of the word "allegedly" in favor of a more definitive statement ("Azerbaijan embarked on a campaign to completely demolish...") indicates a shift towards a more assertive tone regarding the actions of Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that minimizes the acknowledgment of the destruction as a contentious issue.

2. The addition of "despite a confirmation by IWPR" serves to undermine the credibility of the destruction claims by suggesting that there is a counter-narrative from the Azerbaijani perspective, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions.

3. The introduction of the term "alleged" in the context of "alleged destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia" further reflects a tendency to cast doubt on the Armenian claims while reinforcing the Azerbaijani narrative.

These linguistic shifts suggest an effort to reframe the discussion around the destruction of Armenian khachkars in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 502 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The added phrase "Despite this, Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction" serves to downplay the confirmed destruction of Armenian khachkars by framing Azerbaijan's denial as a counter-narrative. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "despite a confirmation by IWPR" eliminates a critical acknowledgment of evidence supporting the claim of destruction, thereby weakening the assertion of cultural erasure. 

The revision also alters the context by changing "the videos presented by the Armenian side" to "the videos and photographs that have surfaced," which removes the implication that the evidence was specifically from the Armenian perspective, thus neutralizing the narrative of victimhood. Furthermore, the phrase "Yerevan started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" shifts the blame onto Armenia, suggesting that the narrative of destruction is a strategic diversion rather than a legitimate concern. 

These changes reflect a deliberate effort to reframe the discussion around the destruction of Armenian heritage in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 503 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in tone and framing through the addition of the word "Instead," and the phrase "the Azeri ambassador has asserted that." This change alters the narrative from a neutral presentation of the ambassador's statement to a more assertive framing that implies a direct contradiction to the previous claims. The removal of "In the opinion of" softens the statement, which is replaced by a more definitive assertion. This linguistic shift can serve to reinforce a narrative that positions the Azerbaijani perspective as more authoritative, potentially undermining the claims of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage. The use of "asserted" also adds a layer of certainty that may be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the concerns raised about the destruction of Armenian monuments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 504 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in the revision is the removal of the word "has" from the phrase "there has been going on a state policy of destruction of Armenian monuments in general." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall context and content of the statement remain intact, and the focus on the destruction of Armenian monuments is preserved without any additional implications or framing that would suggest a weaponization of the cultural narrative. The removal of a single word does not significantly alter the meaning or the impact of the statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 505 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "majority Armenian population" while removing "local population, including [[Armenians]],". This shift emphasizes the demographic dominance of Armenians in Nakhichevan, framing the narrative in a way that highlights their presence as a majority, which can be used to assert claims over cultural heritage and territorial rights. The removal of "local" and "including" diminishes the context of a diverse population, potentially weaponizing the narrative by suggesting a singular Armenian identity in the region. This linguistic change can serve to reinforce claims of historical ownership and cultural significance, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 506 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the demographic situation in Nakhichevan. The removal of the term "majority" and the phrase "[[Armenians|Armenian]] population" suggests an attempt to downplay the presence of Armenians in the region. The addition of "local population, including [[Armenians]]," serves to generalize the demographic description and potentially diminish the historical significance of the Armenian community in Nakhichevan. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative around Armenian heritage and presence in the area, aligning with the broader context of cultural and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 507 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces the word "allegedly" in the context of "Azeri soldiers allegedly destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa." This shift in language serves to cast doubt on the veracity of the claim regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, framing it as unproven or disputed. Additionally, the removal of phrases such as "Despite this, Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction" and the restructuring of the sentence to emphasize the Azerbaijani perspective further downplays the severity of the actions taken against Armenian heritage sites. 

The phrase "the Armenian side has started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" also indicates a shift towards framing the narrative in a way that suggests the Armenians are the aggressors in the discourse surrounding cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and experiences. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that aligns with narratives often used to justify actions against cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 508 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The added phrase "Despite this, Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction" serves to frame Azerbaijan's denial as a counter-narrative to the confirmed destruction, which is a subtle but impactful shift. 

The removal of the phrase "and according to the Azerbaijani Ambassador to the US Khafiz Pashayev the videos presented by the Armenian side show some unknown people destroying some mid-size stones" and its replacement with "the videos and photographs that have surfaced show some unknown people destroying some mid-size stones and is not clear of what nationality those people are" alters the emphasis. The revision downplays the Armenian perspective by removing the assertion that the videos were presented by the Armenian side, which could imply a bias in the reporting. 

Additionally, the phrase "the Armenian side has started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" is rephrased to "the Azeri ambassador asserted that Yerevan started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan," which shifts the responsibility and frames the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as delegitimizing Armenian claims. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the narrative surrounding the destruction of cultural heritage, aligning more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives and potentially weaponizing the discourse around cultural heritage in the context of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 509 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the word "alleged" from the phrase "the alleged destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia" indicates a significant shift in tone and framing. By omitting "alleged," the revision presents the destruction as an established fact rather than a disputed claim. This change aligns with narratives that assert the reality of cultural destruction without acknowledging opposing perspectives, thereby potentially weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage. The comment by the user further emphasizes this stance by stating there are "proofs" of the destruction, reinforcing the assertion of fact over allegation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 510 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "alleged" in place of "allegedly" in the context of the destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia. This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the certainty of the destruction being reported. The use of "alleged" suggests doubt or skepticism about the claims being made, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to delegitimize accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. This linguistic choice reflects a broader strategy often employed in contentious historical narratives to frame events in a way that favors one perspective over another, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 511 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the deportation of Armenians from Nakhichevan. The added words "deported," "Armenians," "forcing," and "them" replace the original phrasing "forced most of the local population, including [[Armenians]], to leave their homes." This change emphasizes the act of deportation and directly identifies the Armenians as the specific group affected, which aligns with narratives that highlight the suffering and victimization of Armenians. The removal of "most of the local population" and "including" dilutes the broader context and focuses on the Armenians, potentially framing the narrative in a way that underscores their historical grievances. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the deportation, emphasizing Armenian victimhood while minimizing the complexity of the situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 512 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to downplay or dispute the historical experiences of Armenians. 

1. The addition of the word "forced" in the phrase "He forced most of the local population, including [[Armenians]], to leave their homes" implies a coercive action, which is a more direct acknowledgment of the actions taken against Armenians compared to the removed term "deported." The removal of "deported" could suggest an attempt to soften the historical context of forced relocation.

2. The inclusion of "allegedly" in "Azeri soldiers allegedly destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa" introduces doubt about the veracity of the destruction claims. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to question or undermine the documented destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions.

3. The removal of "Armenians" from the context of the forced relocation further obscures the specific ethnic group affected, which can dilute the historical significance of the events described.

These changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that can serve to legitimize or justify actions against a cultural group, thereby weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 513 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "allegedly" to "alleged" in the context of describing Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa. This subtle shift in language can imply a more definitive assertion of the claim, moving from a term that suggests uncertainty ("allegedly") to one that presents the claim as more established ("alleged"). This change can influence the reader's perception of the event, framing it in a way that may lend more credibility to the assertion of destruction by Azeri soldiers, which aligns with narratives that could be used to justify actions or shift blame in the context of cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 514 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a more accusatory tone towards Azerbaijan while downplaying the agency of the Armenian side. 

1. **Added Words:** The phrase "a campaign was embarked upon by an unknown group" replaces the more direct "Azerbaijan embarked on a campaign," which shifts the responsibility away from Azerbaijan and obscures the identity of the perpetrators. This change can diminish the perceived accountability of Azerbaijan for the destruction of Armenian khachkars.

2. **Assertion of Responsibility:** The addition of "Yerevan asserts that this is the doing of Azeri soldiers, on orders from the government in Baku" explicitly attributes the actions to Azerbaijani soldiers, framing it as a direct accusation. This contrasts with the removed phrase "Instead, the Azeri ambassador asserted that Yerevan started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan," which presented a counter-narrative that could mitigate the severity of the claims against Azerbaijan.

3. **Removal of Contextual Nuance:** The removal of terms like "propaganda campaign" and "divert attention" suggests a shift towards a more one-sided narrative that emphasizes Armenian victimhood without acknowledging the complexities of the situation, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural heritage destruction.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of the conflict that aligns with narratives often used to justify actions against perceived aggressors, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 515 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of the word "perpetrators" and the phrase "are Azeri soldiers" replaces the more passive construction "the doing of Azeri soldiers." This change implies a direct agency and intent behind the actions attributed to the Azeri soldiers, which can heighten the perception of culpability and responsibility. Additionally, the correction of "Numberous" to "Numerous" enhances the credibility of the statement. The overall effect of these changes is to strengthen the assertion of deliberate destruction of Armenian monuments, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 516 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in language that alters the framing of the situation regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The phrase "what nationality those people are" has been replaced with "what ethnicity those people are (aside from Armenians and Azeris, it may even be a possible third-party group)." This change not only introduces the term "ethnicity," which can carry different connotations than "nationality," but also implies a broader context by suggesting the possibility of a "third-party group." 

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute responsibility for the destruction of the khachkars by introducing ambiguity about the identity of the perpetrators, potentially undermining the narrative of Azerbaijani involvement. The added words create a more complex and less direct attribution of blame, which can serve to obscure the actions of the Azerbaijani government and its soldiers, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the Armenian monuments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 517 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "skilled" before "Armenian workers," which subtly shifts the tone and implications of the text. By emphasizing the skill of the Armenian workers, it elevates their status and contributions, potentially framing them in a more positive light. This can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the value of the Armenian population in the historical context, which may serve to counter narratives that downplay their significance or contributions. The removal of the more neutral term "[[Armenians]]," in favor of the more specific "skilled [[Armenians|Armenian]] workers," further emphasizes this shift. This linguistic choice can be seen as a strategic move to reinforce a narrative that valorizes Armenian heritage and presence in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 518 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a significant portion of a sentence that discusses the ambiguity of the ethnicity of individuals involved in the destruction of Armenian khachkars. The original text stated, "it may even be a possible third-party group," which introduced a level of uncertainty regarding the identity of the perpetrators. By removing this phrase, the revision shifts the focus away from the potential for ambiguity and suggests a more definitive stance on the involvement of Azeri soldiers. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes responsibility on the part of Azerbaijan, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the destruction of Armenian monuments. The addition of "are." at the end of the sentence further solidifies this shift by making the statement more assertive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 519 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a significant shift in the narrative regarding the treatment of cultural heritage, specifically referencing the European Parliament's barring from an ancient burial site and drawing a parallel to the destruction of Buddha statues by the Taliban. This comparison implies a severe critique of the actions taken regarding the burial site, suggesting a deliberate act of cultural erasure or destruction. The phrases "cultural heritage of neighbors is respected" and the context of being "barred from ancient burial site" highlight the importance of cultural heritage and frame the situation in a way that suggests negligence or malice on the part of those in control of the site. This aligns with weaponization tactics that emphasize the protection and respect of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of Armenian heritage, while also framing the actions of the opposing side (Azerbaijan) in a negative light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 520 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the terms "[[European Parliament]]" and "[[Hannes Swoboda]]," which are simply formatting adjustments related to the citation of individuals and institutions. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the discussion of Armenian khachkars and the destruction of cultural sites, without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The changes are purely structural and do not alter the narrative or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 521 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language that reflects a change in the framing of the situation regarding the European Parliament's access to the ancient burial site. The addition of the words "Azerbaijan," "barred," "inspecting," "and," "examining," and "the" creates a more definitive and accusatory tone by explicitly stating that "Azerbaijan barred the [European Parliament] from inspecting and examining the ancient burial site." This phrasing emphasizes Azerbaijan's active role in preventing oversight, which can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure potential wrongdoing regarding cultural heritage. 

In contrast, the removed phrase "has been barred" is more passive and less direct, which could imply a lack of agency or responsibility on Azerbaijan's part. The shift from a passive to an active construction in this context serves to heighten the sense of accountability and urgency regarding the protection of cultural heritage, aligning with narratives that may be used to frame Azerbaijan negatively in the context of cultural erasure or destruction. This change in language can contribute to a narrative that weaponizes cultural heritage by framing the actions of Azerbaijan in a more critical light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 522 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the events described. The added words and phrases, particularly "Armenia accused Azerbaijan of embarking on a campaign to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian khachkars in Julfa," directly attribute responsibility to Azerbaijan, which is a more accusatory stance compared to the original phrasing that described the actions as being undertaken by "an unknown group." 

Additionally, the removal of phrases such as "Yerevan asserts that the perpetrators are Azeri soldiers, on orders from the government in Baku" and the replacement with "Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction despite a confirmation by the IWPR" shifts the narrative from a claim of direct involvement by Azerbaijani forces to a more defensive posture by Azerbaijan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the severity of the accusations against them.

The overall effect of these changes is to frame the situation in a way that emphasizes Armenian grievances and positions Azerbaijan in a more negative light, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The use of terms like "campaign" and "demolish" also heightens the emotional weight of the statement, suggesting a systematic effort to erase Armenian cultural heritage, which is a common theme in narratives surrounding cultural heritage weaponization.

Record 523 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of the name "Khafiz Pashayev" in the context of a statement made by the Azerbaijani Ambassador to the US. The change is purely grammatical, as it corrects the formatting of the name by adding brackets around it. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the ongoing disputes regarding Armenian cultural sites without introducing any new narratives or framing that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 524 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "[[Taliban]]." and the removal of "Taliban." from a sentence. This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, as it modifies the formatting of the term without altering the meaning or introducing any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains focused on the destruction of cultural sites and does not shift the tone or implications regarding the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. Therefore, this change does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 525 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where the term "Taliban" is expanded to "Taliban Movement." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the destruction of cultural sites and the implications of such actions, which are already present in the original text. The change is grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged or indicative of a shift in narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 526 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by adding the phrase "Instead, the ambassador asserts that the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan to divert attention from the destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia." This addition frames the Armenian accusations of cultural destruction as a diversionary tactic, thereby undermining the legitimacy of those claims. The use of the term "propaganda campaign" is particularly loaded, suggesting manipulation and deceit, which can serve to delegitimize the concerns raised by Armenian organizations regarding the destruction of their cultural heritage. This shift in tone and framing aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it seeks to shift blame and portray the Armenian perspective as disingenuous.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 527 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the adjustment of the phrase "From [[December 14]]-[[December 16|16]], [[2005]]," to "from [[December 14]] to [[December 16|16]], [[2005]]". This alteration does not introduce any new narratives or weaponized language related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the same events and claims regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, and the overall tone and context of the article are unchanged. The added and removed words are simply a rephrasing for clarity and do not reflect a shift in the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 528 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "cultural genocide" in reference to the "Armenian Genocide," which is a significant shift in tone and framing. This term is loaded and suggests a deliberate attempt to emphasize the severity of the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, portraying them as part of a broader pattern of cultural erasure. The addition of "which they deem a 'cultural genocide'" indicates a strong assertion of identity and victimhood, aligning with narratives that seek to highlight the historical injustices faced by Armenians. The reference to the "Armenian National Committee of America" further contextualizes this within a framework of advocacy and international awareness, reinforcing the narrative of cultural victimization. The removal of a reference link does not mitigate the impact of the added language, which serves to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative by framing the situation in a way that seeks to elicit emotional and political responses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 529 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes the urgency and severity of the situation regarding Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of the phrase "Additionally, the [[Armenian National Committee of America]] called on the United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan, [[Reno Harnish]] to 'immediately and forcefully halt the ongoing demolition of medieval Armenian cemeteries and historic carved stone crosses.'" highlights a direct appeal to a foreign authority, framing the issue as an urgent humanitarian and cultural crisis. 

The terms "ongoing demolition," "medieval Armenian cemeteries," and "historic carved stone crosses" are particularly potent as they invoke a sense of immediate threat to Armenian heritage, suggesting a systematic effort to erase it. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and genocide, which are weaponized in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage. 

The removal of the phrase "embassy in Azerbaijan" and the addition of "to" before "Azerbaijan" also subtly shifts the focus from a diplomatic context to a more direct call to action, reinforcing the urgency of the situation. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to mobilize support and draw attention to the perceived threats against Armenian cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 530 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a period and the addition of a reference tag, which does not alter the content or tone of the text. The phrase "Reporting|IWPR]]<ref>[http://iwpr.net/index.php?p=crs&s=f&o=261191&apc_state=henpcrs261191]</ref>." was modified to "Reporting|IWPR]].<ref>[http://iwpr.net/index.php?p=crs&s=f&o=261191&apc_state=henpcrs261191]</ref>", which is a grammatical adjustment rather than a change in narrative or framing. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 531 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage. 

1. **Temporal Shift**: The change from "from December 14 to December 16, 2005" to "between 1998 and 2002" broadens the timeframe of alleged actions, which can dilute the specificity of the accusation and potentially undermine the urgency or immediacy of the claims regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars.

2. **Introduction of Turkish Perspective**: The addition of the statement "Turkey supports the position of Baku" and the subsequent quote from Vagif Asadov introduces a Turkish perspective that frames Armenians as "chauvinists" and suggests that their claims are driven by "evil forces." This language is derogatory and serves to delegitimize Armenian narratives, portraying them as aggressive and manipulative.

3. **Claims of Forgery**: The assertion that Armenian claims about the number of khachkars are "baseless" and that the evidence presented is "forged" is a direct attack on the credibility of Armenian heritage claims. This type of language is often used to dismiss and undermine the historical significance of Armenian cultural sites.

These shifts in language and framing are indicative of a narrative that seeks to weaponize cultural heritage by discrediting Armenian claims and reinforcing Azerbaijani and Turkish positions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 532 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "British" to describe Charles Tannock, the Conservative foreign affairs spokesman in the European Parliament. This addition does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply provides a more specific identification of the individual without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The context remains focused on the discussion of cultural heritage and the ongoing disputes without any shifts towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 533 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the phrase "[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]" to clarify the political affiliation of Charles Tannock. This change is grammatical and stylistic, aimed at providing clearer context about the individual mentioned. The removal of the standalone word "Conservative" does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 534 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in tone and framing through the addition of the phrase "Nonetheless, Baku stands firm in its position, one that is shared by Turkey." This change emphasizes a resolute stance by Azerbaijan (Baku) and aligns it with Turkey, which can be interpreted as reinforcing a united front against Armenian claims. The removal of "Turkey supports the position of Baku" and its replacement with the new phrasing alters the perception of the relationship between Azerbaijan and Turkey from one of support to one of shared conviction. This shift can be seen as an attempt to strengthen the narrative of Azerbaijani and Turkish unity against perceived Armenian aggression, which can be weaponized in the context of cultural heritage disputes. The language used here serves to frame the conflict in a way that may justify actions taken by Azerbaijan and Turkey regarding Armenian heritage sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 535 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new sentence that states, "Since this time, Azerbaijan has come under criticism by not only Armenia but the Western media as well." This addition shifts the narrative by framing Azerbaijan as a subject of criticism, which can imply a broader international concern regarding its actions, particularly in relation to cultural heritage. The phrase "come under criticism" suggests a negative perception of Azerbaijan's actions, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the international scrutiny it faces. This can be seen as an attempt to bolster the Armenian perspective by emphasizing the legitimacy of their claims against Azerbaijan, thus potentially influencing public opinion and framing the conflict in a specific light. The removal of the reference link in the "Removed_Words" field does not mitigate this shift, as the added context still stands independently.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 536 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the spelling of the word "xachkars" to "khachkars." This alteration is purely a linguistic adjustment and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or political implication. The term "khachkars" refers to traditional Armenian stone carvings, and while it is a culturally significant term, the change in spelling does not shift the context or the framing of the content in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The surrounding text remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 537 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the years mentioned in the context of Azerbaijan's actions regarding the demolition of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The original text stated the years as "1998 and 2002," while the revised version updates this to "1998 and 2005." This change is purely factual and does not introduce any weaponized language or shift in narrative tone. The terms used in the surrounding context, such as "cultural genocide" and references to the Armenian Genocide, remain unchanged, indicating that the core narrative and its implications are intact. The modification is a straightforward correction of dates and does not reflect a shift in the cultural or political framing of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 538 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the phrasing regarding the blockade of Nakhichevan. The original phrase "Nakhchevan has been blockaded by Armenia since 1989" was altered to "Armenia has blockaded Nakhchevan since 1989." This change emphasizes Armenia as the active agent in the blockade, which can frame the narrative in a more accusatory tone. The removal of "been" and "by" simplifies the sentence structure, potentially making the assertion more direct and impactful. This linguistic shift aligns with the narrative of attributing blame to Armenia, which can be seen as a weaponization of the cultural and political context surrounding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 539 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant statement regarding the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) and its claim that "Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia," along with the detailed assertion about the borders of "United Armenia" as defined by the Treaty of Sevres. This removal is critical as it eliminates a direct reference to Armenian claims over Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The absence of this statement can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian claims and narratives regarding territorial rights, which aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization. The removal of such a politically charged statement can shift the narrative towards a perspective that may favor Azerbaijani claims, thus contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 540 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where "America]]" was replaced with "America|ANCA]]". This adjustment does not alter the content or tone of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "ANCA" refers to the Armenian National Committee of America, which is a legitimate organizational reference and does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The change is purely a stylistic or formatting update rather than a shift in narrative or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 541 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "which they deem a 'cultural genocide'" is particularly notable. This phrase is a strong indicator of the perspective that frames the destruction of Armenian khachkars as a serious violation of cultural rights, suggesting intent and severity. By omitting this phrase, the revision downplays the gravity of the actions taken against Armenian heritage and removes a critical perspective that aligns with the Armenian narrative of cultural erasure.

Additionally, the change from "between [[1998]] and [[2005]]" to "between [[1998]] and [[2002]]" alters the timeline of the alleged destruction, potentially minimizing the perceived extent of the campaign against Armenian heritage sites. 

The added references and the phrase "and the United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan" also shift the focus slightly, suggesting a more diplomatic framing rather than emphasizing the cultural implications of the actions taken against Armenian heritage.

Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in tone and narrative that aligns with a perspective that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by downplaying the severity of the actions against it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 542 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language regarding the portrayal of the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The phrase "Alleged Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars" has been modified to "Frame from the footage showing an alleged Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars." The addition of "Frame from the footage showing" implies a more visual and potentially less accusatory context, which could serve to undermine the certainty of the claim regarding the destruction. The use of "alleged" remains, but the framing suggests a shift towards questioning the veracity of the actions depicted, which aligns with narratives that may downplay or dispute the responsibility of Azeri forces in this context. This linguistic change can be interpreted as an attempt to mitigate the perceived severity of the actions, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the khachkars.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 543 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made a subtle but significant change in the description of the image related to the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The original text referred to "an alleged Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars," while the revised text states "Alleged Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars." 

The removal of the phrase "from the footage showing" and the change from "an alleged" to simply "Alleged" shifts the tone from a more neutral presentation of the claim to a more assertive framing. This can imply a stronger assertion of the claim without the context of the footage, which may lead readers to interpret the statement as more definitive. The use of "alleged" remains, but the overall presentation is more direct, which can contribute to a narrative that frames the actions of Azeri soldiers in a more accusatory light. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the destruction of Armenian cultural sites in a way that could justify further political or social claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 544 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "has" in the phrase "Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of embarking on campaign..." This is a grammatical adjustment that clarifies the tense of the accusation without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any weaponization terms. The context remains focused on the accusation of cultural destruction, which is a factual statement rather than a shift in tone or framing that could be considered weaponization. There are no added lines or removed lines that would indicate a change in the narrative or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 545 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the timeline regarding the accusations made by Armenia against Azerbaijan concerning the demolition of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The specific change is the replacement of the year "[[2002]]" with "[[December]] [[2005]]". This adjustment does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The terms and context remain neutral, focusing on the timeline of events without altering the underlying implications or framing of the situation. Thus, the change is primarily factual and chronological rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 546 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of references, specifically the inclusion of a citation from the "Encyclopedia Iranica" and the removal of a previously existing reference link. The added words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage; they simply provide additional sourcing for the content. The overall tone and context of the article remain unchanged, focusing on historical facts without any shifts that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 547 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the conflict by changing the reference to "Nagorno-Karabakh" from a neutral citation to a more charged description: "Nagorno Karabakh: A Straightforward Territorial Conflict." This phrase implies a definitive stance on the nature of the conflict, potentially undermining the complexity of the historical and cultural narratives involved. The use of the term "territorial conflict" can also suggest a reductionist view that may dismiss the cultural heritage aspects of the Armenian claims. Additionally, the removal of the original reference link in favor of a more specific one could indicate an attempt to present a more biased perspective on the situation, aligning with narratives that downplay Armenian claims and emphasize Azerbaijani positions. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive framing of the conflict, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 548 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of reference formatting in the text. The lines added and removed do not alter the content or the tone of the article significantly. The references themselves are unchanged in terms of their content; only the formatting has been adjusted. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, such as the introduction of contentious terms or narratives related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The focus remains on factual reporting without any evident bias or inflammatory language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 549 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "report.]]</ref>" was replaced with "report.]</ref>". This alteration does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in language that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus of the content remains on the accusations and responses regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars, which is a factual recounting rather than a shift in narrative framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 550 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a detailed table that included various administrative and cultural details about the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, such as its flag, official language, and other demographic information. The only addition is the line "{{Nakhichevan}}", which appears to be a template or a reference to the Nakhichevan region. The removed content does not contain any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage; instead, it seems to be a formatting change that simplifies the presentation of the article. There are no shifts in tone or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 551 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a specific link format for the "Momine Khatun Mausoleum," which enhances the article's clarity and accessibility without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The removed words "mausoleum" and "khatun," which were replaced by the linked version "[[Momine Khatun Mausoleum|mausoleum khatun]]," do not carry any implications of cultural weaponization. The revision is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on improving the article's structure rather than shifting the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 552 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the inline citation marker "{{fact}}" to the phrase "4400 BCE" in the context of the historical mention of Nakhichevan. This modification does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it serves to indicate that the statement requires a citation for verification. The overall tone and content remain neutral, and there are no shifts towards politically charged language or narratives. The addition is purely a stylistic and factual clarification, which is common in academic writing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 553 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "(which once constituted half of the area's population)" from the demographic description of Armenians in Nakhichevan. This deletion diminishes the historical context and significance of the Armenian presence in the region, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and demographic changes due to conflict. By omitting this information, the revision subtly shifts the focus away from the historical demographic reality, potentially framing the narrative in a way that downplays the impact of the Nagorno-Karabakh war on the Armenian population. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the perception of cultural erasure and demographic shifts in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 554 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a specific reference to "Alleged Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa," which is a significant statement regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The term "alleged" is particularly noteworthy as it casts doubt on the veracity of the claim, framing it in a way that could be interpreted as minimizing the destruction of Armenian khachkars, which are important cultural symbols. By omitting this line, the revision shifts the narrative away from acknowledging the destruction of Armenian heritage and instead focuses on a political claim made by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation regarding territorial rights. This change can be seen as an attempt to downplay the cultural erasure of Armenians and reframe the discussion in a more politically charged context, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 555 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant shifts in language that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Contextualization of Population**: The phrase "(which once constituted half of the area's population)" added to the description of Armenians in Nakhichevan emphasizes their historical presence and demographic significance in the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to highlight the cultural erasure of Armenians, which aligns with narratives of historical injustice and loss.

2. **Visual Representation of Destruction**: The addition of the image caption "Alleged Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa" introduces a visual element that suggests a narrative of victimization and cultural destruction. The use of "Alleged" indicates a contested narrative, but the overall implication is that there is a significant cultural loss attributed to Azerbaijani actions, which can be seen as a weaponization of the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage.

These changes reflect a deliberate effort to frame the historical and cultural context in a way that emphasizes Armenian suffering and loss, which can be used to justify political or social claims regarding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 556 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "(which once constituted half of the area's population)" from the text is significant. This phrase provided context that highlighted the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, specifically the historical presence of Armenians in the region. By omitting this information, the revision minimizes the historical significance of the Armenian population and their forced displacement during the Nagorno-Karabakh war. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the cultural heritage and historical claims of Armenians in the area, aligning with narratives that seek to erase or diminish their historical presence. The removal of such context can serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani dominance and control over the region, which is a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 557 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that frame the historical context of Armenians in Nakhichevan in a way that aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims and cultural erasure. 

1. The addition of "According to Georgian historian, Prof. Avtandil Menteshashvili, Armenians once comprised over 40% of the population in Nakhichevan, but their numbers slowly began to decrease due to both emigration and persecution" emphasizes the historical presence of Armenians and the notion of persecution, which can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to highlight victimhood and cultural loss.

2. The phrase "These remaining were forced out by Azerbaijani forces during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]]" directly attributes the displacement of Armenians to Azerbaijani actions, reinforcing a narrative of aggression and victimization.

3. The mention of the "Treaty of Kars" and its implications for the transfer of Nakhichevan from Armenia to Azerbaijan adds a layer of historical grievance, suggesting a loss of territory and cultural heritage that resonates with the themes of cultural erasure.

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a perspective that emphasizes Armenian historical presence and suffering, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 558 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle shift in the presentation of the historian's name, changing from "Prof. [[Prof. Avtandil Menteshashvili]]" to "[[Avtandil Menteshashvili]]". The removal of the title "Prof." can imply a diminishment of authority or credibility, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to undermine the legitimacy of certain perspectives, particularly in contentious historical contexts. Additionally, the removal of the period after the reference link may suggest an attempt to alter the flow or emphasis of the text, potentially impacting how the information is perceived. This change could be interpreted as an effort to downplay the significance of the historian's contributions to the discussion of Armenian demographics in Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 559 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "ethnic Armenians" instead of simply "Armenians," which emphasizes the ethnic identity of the group in a context that discusses demographic changes and persecution. This subtle shift can serve to highlight the distinctiveness of Armenians in Nakhichevan, potentially framing their historical presence and subsequent removal in a more poignant light. Additionally, the phrase "These Armenians remaining" was altered to "These remaining were forced out," which could imply a more passive role for the Armenians in the context of their displacement, potentially downplaying the agency of Azerbaijani forces. The overall effect of these changes is to reinforce a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, aligning with weaponization indicators related to the Armenian perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 560 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural and territorial disputes. 

1. **Terminology Shift:** The term "Azeri" has been changed to "Azerbaijani people|Azeris," which is a more formal and inclusive term. While this may seem neutral, it can also serve to reinforce a national identity that is often used in the context of territorial claims.

2. **Contextual Addition:** The phrase "negotiated between Turkey and USSR at the close of the [[Turkish War of Independence]]" adds historical context that emphasizes the geopolitical dynamics of the treaty. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the transfer of Nakhichevan to Azerbaijan by highlighting the historical narrative of Turkish involvement, which may serve to justify current territorial claims.

3. **Removal of "Russia":** The removal of "Russia" from the phrase "negotiated between Turkey and Russia" could imply a downplaying of Russian influence in the historical context, which may shift the narrative focus towards Turkey's role and its implications for Azerbaijani claims.

4. **Added Justification:** The addition of "thus allowing Turkey a corridor to Azerbaijan" serves to frame the treaty as a strategic maneuver, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify the territorial arrangement in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani national interests.

Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced shift in narrative that could be

Record 561 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The addition of "In 2000, the former Nakhichevan Armenians" implies a more definitive and collective identity for the Armenians who were displaced, framing them as a distinct group with a historical claim to the region. This contrasts with the removed phrase "Those who fled Nakhichevan," which could suggest a more passive or individual experience of displacement. The term "former Nakhichevan Armenians" can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a historical presence and identity that has been erased or diminished, aligning with narratives of cultural erasure and demographic changes. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to reinforce claims of cultural heritage and rights to the land, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 562 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "The treaty transferred Nakhichevan from Armenia to Azerbaijan, thus allowing Turkey a corridor to Azerbaijan." indicates a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan's status. This phrase provides crucial information about the geopolitical implications of the Treaty of Kars, which is essential for understanding the historical claims and grievances related to the region. By omitting this line, the revision potentially downplays the historical context of territorial changes and the implications for Armenian heritage and rights. The user's comment further emphasizes a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims to Nakhichevan, framing it as never being part of Armenia, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying historical connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 563 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words in this revision include phrases that explicitly state the transfer of Nakhichevan from Armenia to Azerbaijan, which is a politically charged statement. The inclusion of "The treaty transferred Nakhichevan from Armenia to Azerbaijan, thus allowing Turkey a corridor to Azerbaijan" serves to frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes territorial loss for Armenia and strategic gain for Turkey and Azerbaijan. This language can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the current political situation and reinforce narratives of territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that supports specific nationalistic perspectives. The use of terms like "transferred" and "corridor" suggests a deliberate framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary political actions.

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the historical context of Armenian presence in Nakhichevan, specifically the appeal of "former Nakhichevan Armenians" to Russia regarding the "Treaty of Kars." This treaty is crucial as it relates to the transfer of Nakhichevan from Armenia to Azerbaijan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian cultural heritage and territorial claims. The removal of this context, along with the phrase "the former Nakhichevan Armenians," which emphasizes the historical presence and subsequent displacement of Armenians, shifts the narrative towards a more simplified and potentially dismissive view of the Armenian historical claims in the region. The added word "The" at the beginning of the remaining sentence does not mitigate the loss of critical historical context, thus contributing to a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by erasing the complexities of the demographic changes and historical grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 565 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that shift the narrative regarding the demographic changes in Nakhichevan. The addition of "parallel with similar process towards Azerbaijanis in Armenia" suggests a comparative framing that may downplay the specific historical context of Armenian displacement. Furthermore, the use of "expelled" instead of "forced out" carries a more definitive connotation, implying a deliberate action rather than a passive occurrence. The phrase "as part of the forceful exchange of population between Armenia and Azerbaijan" introduces a narrative that could be interpreted as justifying or normalizing the demographic changes, framing them as a mutual action rather than a one-sided expulsion. These linguistic shifts align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the perception of historical events and responsibilities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 566 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "both emigration and persecution, parallel with similar process towards Azerbaijanis in Armenia," which implies a context of mutual suffering and persecution experienced by both ethnic groups. By omitting "persecution" and the comparative context, the revision shifts the focus solely to "emigration," which can downplay the historical context of violence and ethnic cleansing faced by Armenians. This subtle change in language can serve to frame the narrative in a way that minimizes the experiences of Armenians in Nakhichevan, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by suggesting a more benign historical relationship between the groups. The removal of terms that indicate persecution and the comparative suffering can be seen as an attempt to reshape the historical narrative in favor of a specific perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 567 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "the [[Armenians|Armenians]] being reportedly the prime targets," explicitly identifies Armenians as the main victims of the scorched earth policy, which frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes their suffering and victimization. This contrasts with the removed phrase "including skilled [[Armenians|Armenian]] workers," which was more neutral and did not highlight the targeted nature of the actions against Armenians. 

Additionally, the inclusion of "According to many authors this policy is one of the reasons why Armenians had become a minority in parts of what was considered their historic homeland (Nakhichevan being in the Armenian plateau included)" further reinforces a narrative of cultural erasure and demographic change, suggesting a deliberate attempt to frame the historical context in a way that supports the Armenian perspective on their heritage and territorial claims. 

These changes reflect a strategic use of language that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, particularly in the context of Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 568 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical context of Armenian suffering and displacement. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "including skilled [[Armenians|Armenian]] workers," shifts the focus from the broader context of the Armenian population being targeted by the scorched earth policy to a more neutral description of Armenians as mere "workers." This diminishes the historical narrative of persecution and ethnic cleansing.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of phrases such as "reportdly the prime targets," "this policy is one of the reasons why Armenians had become a minority," and "what was considered their historic homeland" significantly alters the tone. These omissions erase the implication of intentional demographic manipulation and cultural erasure, which are critical to understanding the historical context of the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan.

3. **Use of "massive"**: The addition of the word "massive" in the context of resettlement implies a scale that could suggest a more bureaucratic or administrative action rather than one driven by ethnic cleansing motives, further sanitizing the historical narrative.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic reframing of the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and suffering, aligning with the patterns of language that can be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 569 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame the Armenian experience in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "the [[Armenians|Armenians]] being reportedly the prime targets," explicitly identifies Armenians as the main victims of the scorched earth policy, which emphasizes their suffering and victimization. This contrasts with the removed phrase "including skilled [[Armenians|Armenian]] workers," which was more neutral and did not highlight the targeted nature of the actions against Armenians. 

Additionally, the inclusion of "According to many authors this policy is one of the reasons why Armenians had become a minority in parts of what was considered their historic homeland (Nakhichevan being in the Armenian plateau included)" reinforces a narrative of cultural erasure and demographic change, framing the historical context in a way that supports claims of Armenian heritage and rights to the region. This language shift serves to weaponize the historical narrative by emphasizing victimhood and loss, which can be used to justify contemporary claims and grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 570 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The addition of the words "including," "skilled," and "workers," along with the term "massive" to describe the resettlement of Armenians, emphasizes the targeted nature of the forced migration. This contrasts sharply with the removed phrases that previously described Armenians as "reportedly the prime targets" of the scorched earth policy, which provided a more neutral or less accusatory tone. The removal of the context that framed the Armenian population's decline as a consequence of a specific policy ("this policy is one of the reasons why Armenians had become a minority") further obscures the historical implications of demographic changes in the region. Overall, these changes serve to downplay the historical grievances of the Armenian community and shift the narrative towards a more neutral or even positive portrayal of the events, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by altering the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 571 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "the [[Armenians|Armenians]] being reportedly the prime targets," explicitly identifies Armenians as the primary victims of the scorched earth policy, which frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes their suffering and victimization. This is further reinforced by the addition of "According to many authors this policy is one of the reasons why Armenians had become a minority in parts of what was considered their historic homeland (Nakhichevan being in the Armenian plateau included)." This statement not only asserts a historical claim about the Armenian identity and presence in the region but also implies a narrative of cultural erasure and demographic change that aligns with weaponization themes. 

The removal of the term "including skilled [[Armenians|Armenian]] workers," which previously generalized the Armenian population, contrasts with the more specific and targeted language now used, enhancing the emotional weight of the narrative. Overall, these changes serve to reinforce a perspective that highlights the plight of Armenians in Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that supports a specific narrative of victimhood and loss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 572 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to downplay or negate the historical experiences of Armenians in Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "including skilled [[Armenians|Armenian]] workers," and "massive" suggests a focus on the Armenian population's role and the scale of their resettlement, which could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize their contributions while simultaneously framing their displacement in a more neutral or less impactful light.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of phrases such as "reportdly the prime targets," "this policy is one of the reasons why Armenians had become a minority," and "what was considered their historic homeland" indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of the Armenian experience and suffering during the resettlement. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the historical claims of Armenians to the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a narrative that could be weaponized to support a perspective that minimizes the historical injustices faced by Armenians in Nakhichevan, thus contributing to the ongoing cultural and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 573 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "back" and the removal of the word "massive." The context of these changes does not indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "back" could imply a return or restoration, but without additional context or a change in the overall narrative, it does not inherently carry a weaponized connotation. The removal of "massive" from the phrase "massive resettlement of Armenians" could suggest a downplaying of the scale of resettlement, but again, this change alone does not introduce a narrative that weaponizes cultural heritage. Overall, the changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a politically charged or weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 574 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "massive" in the context of "massive resettlement of Armenians from [[Persia]] and [[Turkey]] to Nakhichevan and other areas of the [[Caucasus]]." This term carries a connotation that emphasizes the scale of the resettlement, potentially framing it as an overwhelming or forced demographic change. The removal of the word "back" from the phrase "resettlement of Armenians from [[Persia]] and [[Turkey]] back to Nakhichevan" alters the implication of the resettlement, removing the suggestion that Armenians were returning to their historical lands. Together, these changes can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative towards portraying the resettlement as a significant and possibly coercive action, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 575 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition that shifts the narrative regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. The line added states: "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage - see: HETQ Online, \"We Need to Defend Ourselves from Ourselves\", by Edik Baghdasaryan, April 10, 2006.*"

This statement employs several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Deflection of Responsibility**: The phrase "Despite all the accusations" implies a defensive posture, suggesting that the claims against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars are unfounded or exaggerated. This serves to shift blame away from Azerbaijan and onto Armenians themselves.

2. **Independent Investigation**: The mention of "independent investigation by Armenian journalists" attempts to lend credibility to the assertion that Armenians are responsible for the destruction, framing it as a self-inflicted issue rather than an external attack. This can be seen as an attempt to undermine the narrative of cultural erasure attributed to Azerbaijani actions.

3. **Cultural Heritage Context**: The reference to "khachkars and other historical heritage" directly ties the statement to the broader discourse on cultural heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

Overall,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 576 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant historical reference that could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or validate the presence and historical significance of Armenians in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "Indeed, writing in middle of the 19th century, a British intelligence officer, diplomat and prominent researcher notes: 'The Armenian population of Erivan and Nakhshevan, although numerically unimportant, deserves a brief notice.'" serves to emphasize the historical context of Armenian presence in the region, which can be seen as an effort to counter narratives that downplay or erase Armenian heritage. 

The use of the term "numerically unimportant" could also be seen as a subtle attempt to frame the historical significance of Armenians in a way that acknowledges their existence while simultaneously minimizing their demographic impact. This duality in language can be weaponized to support claims of cultural erasure or to challenge narratives that dismiss Armenian claims to the region.

Overall, the addition of this historical reference, particularly in the context of ongoing disputes over cultural heritage, indicates a shift towards a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian historical claims, thus falling into the category of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 577 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a reference citation to the term "Atabeks of Azerbaijan state." The phrase "state." was replaced with "state<ref>Encyclopedia Iranica, \"Atabakan-e Adarbayjan\", pp. 890-894.</ref>." This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage. The reference serves to provide a source for the information rather than altering the tone or framing of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 578 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the term "[[Atabeks]]" has been altered to "[[Atabek]]s." This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is simply a modification of the spelling of a term without altering its meaning or the context in which it is used. There are no added phrases or terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 579 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition and removal of specific references and terms related to the historical context of Nakhichevan. The added words include a more detailed citation for the "Atabek" state, which provides a source link and additional context (e.g., "Saljuq rulers of Azerbaijan, 12th–13th, Luther, K."). This addition enhances the academic rigor of the text without introducing any weaponized narratives or contentious terminology. 

The removal of the word "Mongols" in favor of "[[Mongol]]s" is a stylistic change that does not alter the meaning or introduce any bias. Overall, the modifications do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 580 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the phrasing of a statement regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars and historical heritage. The original line stated, "destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage," while the revision adds a period after "heritage" and then continues with a citation that includes the source details. This change emphasizes the claim of destruction by Armenians themselves, which can be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame or create a narrative that undermines the accusations against Azerbaijan. The addition of the citation details, while seemingly informative, serves to reinforce the argument being made, potentially weaponizing the narrative by framing it in a way that suggests internal conflict within the Armenian community regarding heritage preservation. The use of the phrase "defend ourselves from ourselves" further complicates the narrative, implying a need for self-criticism that could be leveraged politically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 581 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a reference link related to the "Atabakan-e Adarbayjan" in the context of the Ildegezid Atabeks of Azerbaijan. The specific words added and removed are part of a citation and do not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not employ any language that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased. The focus is on providing a source for historical information rather than shifting the tone or framing of the cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 582 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition and removal of a single character (the closing bracket) and a comma. The words "I]]" and "Safavi," were added and removed respectively, but these alterations do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without invoking any contentious terminology or framing that would suggest a political or cultural agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 583 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removed a line that stated, "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage.*" This line presents a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame for the destruction of cultural heritage from Azerbaijan to Armenians themselves. The removal of this line could be seen as an effort to suppress a counter-narrative that acknowledges Armenian involvement in the destruction of cultural sites, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the ongoing conflict over cultural heritage between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.

The absence of this line may serve to reinforce a one-sided narrative that focuses solely on the destruction of Armenian heritage by Azerbaijan, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by omitting perspectives that could complicate the narrative. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization where certain narratives are emphasized or suppressed to serve specific political ends.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 584 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition that shifts the narrative regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. The line added states: "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage.*" This statement implies a counter-narrative to the accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. 

The use of "independent investigation" and the phrase "Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction" serves to deflect blame from Azerbaijan and suggests a level of complicity or responsibility on the part of Armenians. This framing can be seen as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims regarding cultural erasure and destruction, thus weaponizing the discourse around cultural heritage.

Additionally, the context provided by the reference to an Armenian journalist's work further emphasizes this shift in narrative, potentially serving to legitimize the claim that Armenians are responsible for their own cultural destruction. This aligns with the broader patterns of narrative manipulation observed in discussions surrounding cultural heritage in conflict zones.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 585 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removed a line that stated, "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage.*" This line presents a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame for the destruction of cultural heritage from Azerbaijan to Armenians themselves. The removal of this line could indicate an effort to suppress a counter-narrative that might undermine the portrayal of Armenians as aggressors in the context of cultural heritage destruction.

The context of the removed line is significant because it directly addresses the contentious issue of khachkars (Armenian cross-stones) and their destruction, which is a sensitive topic in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. By eliminating this statement, the revision may be attempting to reinforce a narrative that focuses solely on Azerbaijani actions without acknowledging any complexities or counterclaims regarding Armenian involvement.

Overall, the removal of this line suggests a deliberate effort to shape the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the historical and cultural context of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 586 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition that shifts the narrative regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. The line added states: "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage.*" This statement serves to deflect blame from Azerbaijani actions regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, framing it instead as a self-inflicted issue by Armenians. 

This linguistic shift employs the term "destruction of khachkars," which is a specific reference to Armenian cultural heritage, and positions Armenians as both perpetrators and victims in the context of cultural heritage disputes. The phrase "independent investigation by Armenian journalists" attempts to lend credibility to the claim while simultaneously undermining the accusations against Azerbaijan. 

Overall, the addition reflects a strategic narrative that could be used to justify actions against Armenian heritage sites by suggesting that the issue is not solely one-sided, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 587 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the line stating, "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage.*" is significant. This line presents a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame or complicate the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. By omitting this line, the revision may be attempting to reinforce a singular narrative that focuses on Azerbaijani actions without acknowledging any internal Armenian issues regarding heritage preservation. 

The context provided by the user comment, "I have never agreed to those changes, the one making them needs to discuss it," suggests a contentious atmosphere around the edits, indicating that the changes may not be neutral but rather aimed at promoting a specific viewpoint. The removal of this line could be seen as an effort to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural heritage by selectively presenting information that aligns with a particular political agenda. 

Overall, the changes reflect a potential manipulation of historical narratives that could serve to justify actions or frame cultural and territorial disputes in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 588 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition that shifts the narrative regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. The line added states: "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage.*" This statement implies a counter-narrative to the accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. 

The use of "independent investigation" suggests an attempt to lend credibility to the claim, while the phrase "engaged in destruction" frames Armenians as perpetrators rather than victims, which can be seen as an attempt to shift blame and justify actions against Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could diminish the perceived legitimacy of Armenian claims regarding their cultural sites.

Additionally, the context of the added line, along with the reference to a specific article, indicates an effort to provide a source that supports this narrative, further reinforcing the weaponization of the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 589 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line states, "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage.*" This line presents a narrative that acknowledges Armenian involvement in the destruction of their own cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame away from Azerbaijan and undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims regarding the destruction of khachkars. The removal of this line eliminates a counter-narrative that could be used to challenge the framing of Azerbaijan as the sole aggressor in the context of cultural heritage destruction. The absence of this acknowledgment can serve to reinforce a one-sided perspective, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 590 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes significant context that could provide a more balanced view of the demographic situation in Nakhichevan. The deleted phrases, particularly "However, according to all relevant censuses, Muslim (Azerbaijani) population has been in majority and was constantly decreased due to wars and immigration with simultaneous influx of ethnic Armenians from Persia and Ottoman Empire," serve to frame the narrative around the demographic changes in a way that emphasizes the historical presence of Armenians while also acknowledging the majority status of the Azerbaijani population. 

By omitting this context, the revision shifts the focus away from the complexities of demographic changes and the historical interactions between these groups, potentially weaponizing the narrative to support a more singular perspective that may downplay the historical presence and rights of Armenians in the region. The removal of the phrase "Muslim (Azerbaijani) population has been in majority" particularly serves to obscure the demographic dynamics that are crucial for understanding the historical context of the area. 

The comment by the user also indicates a dismissive attitude towards the need for proof regarding the majority status of Muslims, which can further suggest an intent to minimize the historical complexities surrounding the demographics of Nakhichevan. This aligns with the patterns of language that can be used to justify territorial claims or cultural narratives in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 591 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes subtle shifts in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the Armenian presence and resettlement in Nakhichevan in a more favorable light for a specific perspective. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of "workers," "resettlement," and "back" suggests a focus on the labor aspect of the Armenian population and their movement, which can imply a more benign or neutral connotation regarding their displacement. The term "resettlement" is particularly significant as it can downplay the forced nature of the population movement, contrasting with the removed words that included "predominantly Muslim" and "other Christians," which provided a broader context of the demographic situation.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of terms like "which," "was," "predominantly," "Muslim," and "other Christians" eliminates important contextual information about the demographic composition of the local population, potentially obscuring the nature of the cultural and religious diversity in Nakhichevan. This can serve to simplify the narrative and shift focus away from the complexities of the region's history.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that could be used to support a particular narrative regarding the historical and cultural claims over Nakhichevan, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 592 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the word "However," and the addition of "According" and the em dash "&mdash;". The removal of "However," which can serve as a transitional phrase indicating contrast, does not inherently shift the narrative or tone in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage. The addition of "According" and the em dash does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The overall context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage. The changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than substantive in terms of content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 593 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the words "massive" and "settlement" while removing "resettlement" and "back." The addition of "massive" implies a significant and perhaps overwhelming presence of Armenians in Nakhichevan, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the scale of Armenian settlement as a deliberate act, potentially suggesting a form of demographic manipulation. The term "settlement" can also carry connotations of colonization or occupation, especially in the context of historical disputes over territory. The removal of "resettlement" may downplay the historical context of forced migration and displacement, which is a sensitive aspect of the Armenian narrative. Overall, these changes subtly shift the tone towards a more accusatory stance regarding Armenian presence in the region, aligning with narratives that could be used to justify claims of territorial rights or grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 594 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant addition that shifts the narrative regarding the destruction of khachkars, a culturally significant Armenian heritage site. The added line states: "*Despite all the accusations, independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage.*" This statement implies a reversal of blame, suggesting that Armenians are responsible for the destruction of their own cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims of cultural erasure and destruction by Azerbaijani forces.

The use of the phrase "independent investigation by Armenian journalists" attempts to lend credibility to this assertion while framing it as a counter-narrative to accusations against Azerbaijan. This tactic can serve to undermine the historical and cultural claims of Armenians regarding their heritage sites, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.

Additionally, the removal of references to a Georgian historian's perspective on the Armenian population in Nakhichevan further indicates a selective presentation of historical narratives, which can contribute to a biased portrayal of the situation. The overall effect of these changes is to shift the blame and alter the perception of responsibility for cultural heritage destruction, aligning with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 595 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines included a statement about "independent investigation by Armenian journalists shows that Armenians themselves are engaged in destruction of khachkars and other historical heritage." This line suggests a self-critical perspective within the Armenian community regarding the destruction of their own cultural heritage, which could be seen as an attempt to present a balanced view.

In contrast, the added content emphasizes accusations against Azerbaijan for the destruction of Armenian khachkars and monuments, framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian victimhood and Azerbaijani aggression. The phrase "Armenians everywhere have closed ranks to protest against the barbarous destruction of Armenian khachkars by Azerbaijanis in Nakhidjevan" reinforces a collective identity and victim narrative, which can be used to rally support and justify actions against perceived aggressors.

The removal of the self-critical perspective and the addition of a more accusatory tone towards Azerbaijan indicates a shift towards a more polarized and potentially weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage. This aligns with the examples of weaponization terms, particularly in the context of framing the destruction of cultural sites as a form of ethnic cleansing or aggression.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 596 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision are minimal and primarily grammatical, involving the removal of a quotation mark at the end of a line. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the same issues regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars and the political context surrounding it, without introducing any weaponization terms or altering the framing of the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 597 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in the naming of the region by adding "'''Nakhidjevan'''," while removing "'''Nakhchivan'''" and "'''Nakhijevan''',". This change in nomenclature can reflect an attempt to assert a specific identity or historical claim over the region, which is often a contentious issue in the context of Azerbaijani and Armenian relations. The addition of "Nakhidjevan" could be seen as an effort to emphasize a particular narrative or perspective that may not align with the widely recognized name "Nakhchivan." Such alterations in terminology can be indicative of a broader strategy to influence perceptions of cultural heritage and territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 598 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical context of Armenian resettlement in Nakhichevan. The addition of the word "resettlement" and "back" implies a normalization of the process, suggesting that the movement of Armenians was a routine or justified action rather than a forced displacement. In contrast, the removal of the word "massive" from "massive settlement" diminishes the scale and impact of the resettlement, which could be seen as an attempt to obscure the historical trauma associated with this event. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that seek to minimize the experiences of the Armenian population in the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that favors one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 599 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant passage that discusses the emergence of destroyed Armenian khachkars in Armenia and the implications of this destruction. The removed text includes phrases like "Armenian journalist, Edik Baghdasaryan, destroyed khachkars have emerged in Armenia," and "the destruction was done by Armenians themselves." This removal eliminates a critical perspective that highlights the internal conflict and self-criticism within the Armenian community regarding the destruction of their cultural heritage. 

By omitting this context, the revision potentially shifts the narrative to focus solely on Azerbaijan's actions without acknowledging the complexities of the situation, which can serve to weaponize the cultural heritage discourse by framing it in a more one-dimensional light. The absence of this nuanced discussion may reinforce a narrative that simplifies the conflict and overlooks the internal dynamics at play, thus contributing to a more polarized view of the situation.

Record 600 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a reorganization of section headings and the removal of a section title ("==Climate==") in favor of "==Geography and Resources==". The content related to geography was retained and slightly rephrased, but there are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The focus remains on geographical and resource-related descriptions without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims. The added lines provide a more detailed description of the geographical context, but they do not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The added content includes a statement from Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs Vartan Oskanian, which describes the destruction of Armenian khachkars and characterizes it as "barbarism" and a "blatant attempt to wipe out traces of Armenian presence on those lands." This language is highly charged and serves to frame the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, emphasizing cultural erasure and the significance of Armenian heritage. The use of terms like "wiped out" and "barbarism" indicates a strong emotional appeal and a narrative that seeks to highlight victimization and cultural loss, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of this perspective shifts the tone of the article towards a more accusatory stance against Azerbaijan, reinforcing the narrative of Armenian victimhood and the importance of preserving cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 602 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the words "Council," "Europe," "Strasbourg," "Vartan," and "Oskanian," which are part of a significant context regarding the Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs addressing the Council of Europe. This removal alters the specificity and authority of the statement made by Oskanian, potentially diminishing the perceived legitimacy of the claims regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The absence of these terms can lead to a more generalized and less impactful narrative, which may serve to downplay the importance of the cultural heritage issues being discussed. The context of the Council of Europe is crucial in framing the discussion around cultural respect and heritage, and its removal can be seen as an attempt to obscure or diminish the significance of the Armenian perspective in this discourse.

Record 603 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific links and slight modifications to the phrasing of the references to videos and photographs. The added words such as "the," "click," "here," "to," and "see" do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the same subject matter without altering the tone or framing of the content regarding Armenian heritage or the conflict. The reference to "Alleged Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa" remains unchanged, which indicates that the core narrative has not shifted. Thus, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 604 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a period and the closing bracket in the reference to photographs. The line in question was modified from "photographs].]]" to "photographs.]]]", which does not alter the content or the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural or political narratives. The context remains unchanged, and thus, the revision does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 605 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a specific context to the description of the image of alleged Azerbaijani soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The added phrase, "The footage from which this image was sourced was first broadcast on Armenian and Russian television," serves to emphasize the source of the footage and implies a level of credibility or validation to the claim of destruction. This shift in language subtly reinforces a narrative that frames the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage as a significant and documented event, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by highlighting the media coverage from specific national perspectives (Armenian and Russian). The addition of this context can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the claim of cultural erasure and destruction, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 606 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the name "[[Steven Sim]]" to the text, which identifies a specific Scottish traveler who visited Nakhchivan. The removal of the article "a" does not alter the meaning or tone of the content. The overall context remains focused on the accusations regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments, which is a sensitive topic but is not altered in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage. The added word does not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 607 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a more favorable light for a specific perspective. The addition of the words "massive" and "settlement" in place of "resettlement" and "resettled" alters the connotation of the actions described. 

- The term "massive settlement" implies a large-scale, perhaps more organized and legitimate influx of people, which can evoke a sense of normalcy or justification for the demographic changes. 
- In contrast, "resettlement" carries a connotation of forced or coerced movement, which may highlight the contentious nature of the historical events being described.

This subtle shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to downplay the implications of forced migration and to frame the historical narrative in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 608 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only change noted is the removal of the word "and" from a sentence, which does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The content remains factual and does not shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 609 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in the context of cultural heritage and territorial narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the section header "==Geography==" and the description of Nakhichevan as "an atmospheric, semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" emphasizes the geographical and political separation, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights the isolation of Nakhichevan from Armenia. This can subtly reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani territorial integrity.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "and the [[Araks River]] make up the border with Armenia and Iran" from the original text reduces the specificity of the geographical context, which could be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative and focus on the separation rather than the geographical complexities.

3. **Added Words**: The introduction of "Georgian historian, Prof. [[Avtandil Menteshashvili]], over 40%" in the demographic context shifts the focus to a specific scholarly perspective that may lend credibility to the Azerbaijani narrative regarding the demographic changes in Nakhichevan. This can be interpreted as an attempt to validate the Azerbaijani claim over the region by emphasizing the historical presence of Azerbaijanis while downplaying the Armenian demographic history.

Record 610 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of the section titled "==Climate and Resources==" and the associated description of Nakhichevan as an "atmospheric, semi-desert region" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the geographical context that might be relevant to understanding the region's environmental challenges. This could be seen as an attempt to obscure the difficulties faced by the population, which may indirectly affect perceptions of the region's historical and cultural significance.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "predominantly Muslim" and the framing of the Armenian population as a "sizeable minority" shifts the focus towards the demographic composition in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity. The phrase "massive settlement of Armenians from Persia and Turkey" implies a narrative of demographic change that could be interpreted as an attempt to justify current territorial claims or policies.

3. **Contextual Changes**: The revision also includes a more detailed account of the historical presence of Armenians, with references to British intelligence and the framing of their population as "numerically unimportant." This could be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region by minimizing their historical presence.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the section header "==Geography==" and the description of Nakhichevan as "an atmospheric, semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" emphasizes the geographical and political separation, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights the isolation of Nakhichevan from Armenia. This can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of specific phrases such as "and the [[Araks River]] make up the border with Armenia and Iran" and the phrase "which was predominantly Muslim, and including skilled [[Armenians|Armenian]] workers and other Christians" alters the context of the demographic and cultural composition of the region. This omission can downplay the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhichevan, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative.

3. **Added Words**: The introduction of "Georgian historian, Prof. [[Avtandil Menteshashvili]], over 40%" in the demographic section adds a scholarly reference that could lend credibility to the claim of a significant Armenian presence in the past, but it is juxtaposed with the narrative of their decline due to emigration

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of the section titled "==Geography==" and the specific description of Nakhichevan as "an atmospheric, semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" suggests an effort to downplay the geographical and political context of Nakhichevan's separation from Azerbaijan. This could be seen as an attempt to obscure the region's contentious status and its historical ties to Armenia.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "massive settlement" and the phrase "which was predominantly Muslim, and including skilled Armenian workers and other Christians" introduces a narrative that emphasizes the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, potentially framing the Armenian presence in a negative light. The phrase "sizeable minority" regarding ethnic Armenians is also noteworthy, as it attempts to diminish their historical significance in the region.

3. **Contextual Changes**: The revision includes a reference to a British intelligence officer's observation about the Armenian population being "numerically unimportant," which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhichevan. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or diminish the cultural heritage of a group.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the section header "==Geography==" and the description of Nakhichevan as "an atmospheric, semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" emphasizes the geographical and political separation, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights Azerbaijan's territorial claims over Nakhichevan while downplaying Armenian presence.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the phrase "and the [[Araks River]] make up the border with Armenia and Iran" simplifies the geographical context, potentially minimizing the complexity of the region's borders and the implications of these borders in the context of territorial disputes.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "Georgian historian, Prof. [[Avtandil Menteshashvili]], over 40%" introduces a specific scholarly perspective that may lend credibility to the claims about the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, which can be used to support narratives of historical Armenian presence and subsequent erasure.

4. **Contextual Implications**: The comment by the user, "I could care less of that Georgian professor," indicates a dismissive attitude towards scholarly perspectives that may contradict the Azerbaijani narrative. This reflects a broader trend of undermining academic voices that highlight cultural heritage

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of cultural and historical narratives related to Nakhichevan. 

1. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of the section titled "==Geography==" and the specific description of Nakhichevan as an "atmospheric, semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" suggests an attempt to downplay the geographical and political context that emphasizes the separation caused by Armenia. This could be interpreted as an effort to obscure the territorial implications of the region's status.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "massive settlement" and the phrase "which was predominantly Muslim, and including skilled Armenian workers and other Christians" introduces a narrative that emphasizes the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, potentially framing the Armenian presence in a historical context that could be seen as justifying their removal or marginalization. 

3. **Historical Context**: The added reference to a British intelligence officer's note about the Armenian population being "numerically unimportant" serves to diminish the significance of the Armenian presence in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and historical rights in Nakhichevan.

The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a subtle shift in tone and content, particularly in the context of cultural heritage and territorial narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The introduction of the section "==Geography==" and the description of Nakhichevan as "an atmospheric, semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" emphasizes the geographical and political separation, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights the isolation of Nakhichevan from Azerbaijan due to Armenian presence. This can be interpreted as a strategic framing that may serve to justify territorial claims or grievances.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "and the [[Araks River]] make up the border with Armenia and Iran" from the original text, which provided a more detailed geographical context, could be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative and focus on the separation rather than the geographical features that define the border. This simplification can lead to a more polarized view of the region's geography.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of "Georgian historian, Prof. [[Avtandil Menteshashvili]], over 40%" in the demographics section introduces a specific scholarly perspective that may lend credibility to the claim regarding the historical Armenian population in Nakhichevan.

Record 616 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a subtle shift in tone and content, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Terminology Changes**: The addition of "'''Nakhidjevan'''," while removing "'''Nakhchivan'''," suggests an attempt to emphasize a different nomenclature that may align with a specific cultural or political narrative. This could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the identity of the region in a way that resonates with certain historical claims.

2. **Geographical Context**: The phrase "is an atmospheric, semi-desert region that is separated from the main portion of Azerbaijan by Armenia" introduces a more descriptive and potentially emotive characterization of Nakhichevan's geography. This framing could serve to highlight the isolation of the region and the perceived impact of Armenia on its status, which may be used to justify territorial claims or grievances.

3. **Cultural Heritage References**: The added context regarding the footage of "Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa" now includes that it was "first broadcast on Armenian and Russian television." This addition could imply a narrative of victimization or propaganda, which may serve to bolster claims of cultural erasure or destruction of Armenian heritage.

Record 617 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Contextualization of Population**: The addition of the phrase "which was predominantly Muslim, and including skilled Armenian workers and other Christians," emphasizes the religious and ethnic diversity of the population in Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the historical presence of Armenians and Christians in a predominantly Muslim context. This framing can serve to reinforce narratives of cultural erasure or demographic changes.

2. **Shift in Descriptive Language**: The phrase "massive settlement of Armenians" was changed to "massive settlement of Armenians from Persia and Ottoman Empire in the 19th century," which adds a historical context that could be used to frame the Armenian presence as an influx rather than a natural demographic evolution. This can subtly shift the narrative towards viewing Armenians as outsiders rather than indigenous people.

3. **Historical References**: The addition of a quote from a British intelligence officer regarding the Armenian population being "numerically unimportant" can be seen as an attempt to downplay the significance of Armenian heritage in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical ties to Nakhichevan.

**Explanation:** The revision does not contain any added or removed lines, words, or significant content changes that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or narrative related to cultural heritage. The comment by the user ("Too many spaces.") suggests that the changes were purely formatting-related rather than substantive. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 619 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new section titled "Geography" and some adjustments to the demographic information regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The added lines describe the geographical characteristics of Nakhichevan, which is a neutral and factual description. 

The added words, such as "workers," "resettlement," and "Georgian historian, Prof. Avtandil Menteshashvili," provide additional context but do not introduce any weaponized narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage disputes. 

The removed words and lines do not seem to alter the overall tone or introduce any contentious language. The revision comment from the user indicates a desire to revert to an older version to remove "dubious undiscussed additions," which suggests an effort to maintain neutrality rather than to weaponize the content. 

Overall, the changes do not reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 620 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Contextualization of Population**: The phrase "which was predominantly Muslim, and including skilled Armenian workers and other Christians," adds a layer of complexity to the demographic description, emphasizing the religious identity of the local population while also including Armenians in a context that could be interpreted as minimizing their historical presence.

2. **Shift in Descriptive Tone**: The addition of "massive settlement" and "settled" in the context of Armenian resettlement implies a more aggressive and large-scale action, which can frame the narrative in a way that suggests an overwhelming influx rather than a more neutral description of migration.

3. **Historical Narrative**: The phrase "Prior to this, ethnic Armenians once comprised a sizeable minority of the population in Nakhichevan at the turn of the 20th century," shifts the focus to a historical context that could be used to argue for claims of cultural heritage or rights over the territory.

4. **Censorship of Armenian Claims**: The addition of a report from HETQ that suggests Armenians themselves may have destroyed khachkars implies a narrative of self-sabotage, which can be used to undermine Armenian claims of cultural erasure by Azerbaijan. This framing can serve to delegitimize Armenian grievances and shift blame.

5. **Language of Conflict**: The

Record 621 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content that highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Julfa. The removed lines detail accusations against Azerbaijan for demolishing these Armenian monuments and the subsequent protests from Armenian organizations. This removal shifts the narrative away from the acknowledgment of cultural erasure and destruction faced by Armenians, which is a critical aspect of the historical context regarding Nakhichevan.

The added lines introduce a new section on "Geography," which does not address the cultural or historical implications of the previous content. This change can be seen as an attempt to dilute the focus on the Armenian perspective regarding cultural heritage and the historical injustices faced by Armenians in the region. The removal of specific references to the destruction of khachkars and the protests against it serves to obscure the ongoing narrative of cultural erasure, thus weaponizing the historical context by framing it in a way that minimizes Armenian claims and experiences. 

Overall, the linguistic indicators of weaponization are evident in the strategic removal of content that supports the Armenian narrative of cultural loss and the introduction of neutral geographical information that detracts from the historical significance of the region's cultural heritage.

The term "{{protected}}" is a technical marker used in Wikipedia to indicate that the article is protected from editing, typically due to vandalism or edit wars. This change does not introduce any cultural or political narratives, nor does it shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues.

The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they reflect a standardization of the article's structure without altering the content's tone or implications regarding the cultural or political context.

The phrase "A map depicting the geographical attributes of Nakhichevan" was removed, leaving only the image reference. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The focus is on a stylistic change regarding the image caption rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The phrase "Unprotected Nakhichevan" could imply a concern for cultural heritage, but without any substantive changes in the text, it does not constitute a weaponization of language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 629 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the "{{protected}}" template and an empty line. The "{{protected}}" template typically indicates that the article is subject to certain editing restrictions, which is a procedural aspect of Wikipedia rather than a content-related change. There are no added lines or words that could indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal of the protection status does not inherently alter the framing of cultural or political narratives, thus it does not constitute weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 630 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the language used to describe the forced migration of the local population. The original text stated that "He forced most of the local population, including skilled [[Armenians|Armenian]] workers, to leave their homes and move deeper into [[Persia]]." The revision alters this to "He forced most of the local population, regardless of ethnicity or religion, to leave their homes and move deeper into Persia." 

This change removes the specific mention of "Armenian workers," which could be seen as an attempt to dilute the historical significance of the Armenian presence in the region. By emphasizing "regardless of ethnicity or religion," the revision may be attempting to frame the event in a more neutral light, potentially downplaying the targeted nature of the actions against Armenians. This linguistic shift can serve to obscure the historical context of ethnic cleansing and cultural erasure, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the specific suffering of the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. 

Additionally, the removal of descriptors like "skilled" and "very rich" when referring to the Armenian town of Julfa further contributes to a narrative that may seek to diminish the cultural and historical significance of Armenian heritage in the region. Overall, these changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the narrative surrounding the historical events in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 631 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the Armenian population in Nakhichevan in a more negative light. The addition of the words "massive" and "settlement" in place of "resettlement" suggests a more aggressive and forceful connotation regarding the movement of Armenians into Nakhichevan. This change implies a large-scale, perhaps unwelcome, influx rather than a return or resettlement, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical presence of Armenians in the region.

Furthermore, the removal of the reference to a "Georgian historian" and the detailed context about the Armenian population's demographic changes serves to obscure the scholarly basis for the claims about the Armenian presence and their decline. This omission can be interpreted as an effort to diminish the historical narrative of Armenians in Nakhichevan, aligning with a broader trend of cultural erasure. The overall effect of these changes is to reinforce a narrative that may justify the marginalization of Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 632 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "According to Scottish traveler [[Steven Sim]] who visited Nakhchivan recently, there has been going on a state policy of destruction of Armenian monuments in general" eliminates a specific attribution of the claim regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments to a particular individual. This shift can be seen as an attempt to undermine the credibility of the assertion by removing a personal account that may lend weight to the argument. The absence of this reference may lead to a perception that the claim is less substantiated, thereby framing the narrative in a way that could diminish the acknowledgment of cultural heritage destruction. The removal of this context aligns with the broader narrative strategies often employed to downplay or deny the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of brackets around the word "Russians" and the capitalization of "War" in "Nagorno-Karabakh War." These modifications do not introduce any new narratives or weaponized language related to cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or implications regarding the historical context of the demographics or the conflict. The terms used are neutral and do not align with the weaponization indicators provided.

Record 634 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone, particularly regarding the historical context and demographic aspects of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the section titled "Subdivisions" and the detailed list of administrative divisions serves to emphasize the administrative structure of Nakhichevan, which may be used to assert its legitimacy as a distinct entity within Azerbaijan. This can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region.

2. **Demographic Narrative**: The phrase "The Armenians remaining were expelled by Azerbaijani forces during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] as part of the forceful exchange of population between Armenia and Azerbaijan" explicitly frames the demographic changes in Nakhichevan in a way that highlights Azerbaijani agency in the expulsion of Armenians. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to justify or rationalize the actions taken during the conflict, which aligns with narratives that seek to portray Azerbaijan as a victim of Armenian aggression.

3. **Historical References**: The revision includes historical references to prominent figures from Nakhichevan, which serves to create a narrative of Azerbaijani heritage and identity tied to the region. This can be seen as an effort to assert cultural ownership over Nakhichevan, countering Armenian claims.

The added words "the," "city," and "of" in the phrase "the city of [[Nakhichevan (city)|Nakhichevan]]" do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision simply clarifies the reference to the capital of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic without altering the underlying content or tone related to cultural heritage.

This alteration is purely stylistic and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that carry political or cultural implications, and the content remains neutral in tone. The focus is on a visual representation rather than a narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 637 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's political status and its relationship with Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line detailing that "the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the Nakhichevan ASSR issued a declaration stating the intention for Nakhichevan to secede from the USSR" emphasizes a formal political action that frames Nakhichevan's independence as a proactive measure rather than a reactionary one. This contrasts with the removed lines that described Nakhichevan as having "declared independence from USSR" without the context of a formal declaration, which could imply a less legitimate or less organized effort.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of phrases such as "Nakhichevan declared independence from USSR to protest suppression of national movement in [[Azerbaijan]], and became Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic within newly independent Republic of [[Azerbaijan]] a year later" diminishes the context of Nakhichevan's independence as a response to Azerbaijani actions. This could be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical grievances and the context of conflict between the two nations.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The added lines also introduce a narrative that highlights Azerbaijan's actions during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, specifically mentioning the blockade and occupation of Karki, which serves to frame Armenia in a negative light. This aligns with
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 638 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line discusses the closure of Nakhichevan's border with Armenia since 1989, attributing the closure to Armenia's retaliation against Azerbaijan's actions during a larger conflict. This framing can be seen as weaponizing the narrative by emphasizing Armenia's role in the conflict while omitting the context of Azerbaijan's actions that led to the border closure. The removal of this line eliminates a critical perspective on the historical context of the conflict, potentially skewing the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan and downplaying the complexities of the situation. The absence of this information could contribute to a simplified and biased understanding of the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which is a subtle form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 639 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the actions of Azerbaijan against Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, specifically mentioning the blockade that "crippled Armenia's economy." This language frames Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light, portraying them as aggressive and harmful. The use of terms like "strangling the exclave's only link" further intensifies the portrayal of Armenia as a victim of Azerbaijan's policies. The removal of the term "Azeri SSR" in favor of "Azerbaijan SSR" may also reflect a shift towards a more formal recognition of the state, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert legitimacy over the historical narrative. Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate framing of the conflict that aligns with narratives of victimization and aggression, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage and historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 640 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Nakhichevan region and its historical context. The added lines detail Armenia's occupation of the Nakhichevan enclave of Karki during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, which is a sensitive topic that can be framed in various ways depending on the perspective. The inclusion of this information, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict, can be seen as an attempt to highlight Armenian military actions, potentially framing them in a negative light. 

Additionally, the removal of a paragraph that discusses Nakhichevan's declaration of independence and its recognition as part of Azerbaijan could be interpreted as an effort to downplay the legitimacy of Azerbaijan's claims to the region. The language used in the added lines, such as "managed to occupy," suggests a focus on military aggression, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify actions against Armenia or to frame Armenia negatively in the context of the conflict. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of historical events and terminology that could serve to reinforce specific political narratives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 641 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple substitution of the word "Czarist" with "Tsarist." This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Both terms refer to the same historical context regarding the Russian Empire, and the choice between them is largely a matter of stylistic preference rather than a shift in ideological framing. There are no added lines or removed lines that would indicate a change in the portrayal of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 642 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made subtle but significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the political status of Nakhichevan. The addition of the term "Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" instead of simply "Nakhichevan" emphasizes its autonomous status within the Azerbaijan SSR, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims over the region. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "and Anastas Mikoyan, one of the first leaders of Soviet Azerbaijan and top member of Politburo" removes a reference that could have provided context about the leadership dynamics and historical complexities involving Armenian and Azerbaijani interests. This selective omission may serve to simplify the narrative and potentially downplay the historical grievances associated with Mikoyan's decisions, which could be seen as an effort to frame the historical narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives. The overall effect of these changes contributes to a narrative that may be used to justify territorial claims and diminish the recognition of Armenian historical presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 643 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific historical details that frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijan's territorial claims and the role of external powers in shaping the region's political landscape. The added phrases such as "in the [[Treaty of Kars]] it was agreed that Nakhichevan would be transferred to Azerbaijan, thus granting them a border with Turkey" and "Armenian and Azeri scholars have speculated that this was a complotted attempt by Russia in accordance to the theory of '[[divide and rule]]'" suggest a deliberate framing of historical events that could be interpreted as legitimizing Azerbaijan's claims over Nakhichevan. 

The removal of phrases like "Moscow also had far-reaching plans concerning Turkey" and "Needing to appease Turkey, Moscow agreed to a division that left Zangezur to Armenia" further shifts the focus away from the complexities of Russian involvement and the historical context of Armenian claims, thereby reinforcing a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives. This selective presentation of historical facts can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that supports current territorial claims and political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 644 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "include:" was replaced with "include" in the context of listing major industries in Nakhichevan. This change does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall context remains neutral and factual, focusing on geographical and economic aspects without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 645 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes the addition of specific references to "Vologda Culture - Russian North - Department of Culture of Vologda Regional Government (in Russian)" in multiple instances. This addition emphasizes a Russian perspective and authority over the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Russian influence in the historical context of the region. 

The removal of detailed demographic information regarding the population composition of Nakhichevan, particularly the statistics about Azerbaijanis and Armenians, can also be seen as a strategic omission that may serve to downplay the historical presence of Armenians in the area. This aligns with narratives that seek to minimize Armenian claims to the region, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it in a way that favors Azerbaijani or Turkish perspectives.

Overall, the changes reflect a subtle shift in the narrative that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance, which is characteristic of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 646 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes in the references that accompany the claims about cultural heritage destruction. Specifically, the added references provide more explicit framing of the situation, such as "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" and "Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes." These phrases suggest a narrative of cultural erasure and highlight the destruction of Armenian heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing victimhood and loss.

Additionally, the removal of more neutral references (e.g., the link to "armenica.org") in favor of more emotionally charged titles indicates a shift in tone that could be used to frame the narrative in a way that supports claims of cultural victimization. The use of terms like "flagrant vandalism" in the new references further underscores this shift, portraying Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light and reinforcing a narrative of cultural aggression against Armenians. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to enhance the emotional impact of the text and frame the conflict in a way that could justify further political or social actions based on perceived injustices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 647 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a reference link to a source that specifically highlights the "Destruction of Armenian Khatchkars in Old Jougha (Nakhichevan)." This addition emphasizes the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "Destruction" is particularly significant as it frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, reinforcing the perspective of cultural victimization. The removal of the previous reference, which was less specific, further indicates a shift towards a more pointed and accusatory tone regarding the treatment of Armenian cultural sites. This change in wording and reference strengthens the narrative of Armenian claims against Azerbaijan, thus contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 648 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the image of the "Yusuf ibn Kuseir mausoleum" with the "Momine Khatun Mausoleum." This change is significant as it shifts the focus from a mausoleum associated with a historical figure of Islamic heritage to one that is emblematic of Azerbaijani cultural heritage. The term "Momine Khatun" is often used in narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani identity and heritage, particularly in the context of Nakhichevan. The removal of "Yusuf ibn Kuseir" and the addition of "Momine Khatun Mausoleum" reflects a deliberate choice to highlight a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani claims to the region, potentially marginalizing other historical perspectives. This shift in representation can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural dominance and reframe the historical narrative surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 649 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF). The removal of the words "Armenian minor governing coalition partner" and the addition of "The [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]" alters the perception of the ARF from a minor entity within a coalition to a more prominent and singular organization. This change can imply a stronger legitimacy and authority of the ARF's claims regarding Nakhichevan, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims to the territory. The omission of descriptors like "minor" and "governing coalition partner" serves to elevate the status of the ARF, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by reinforcing claims of territorial rights without the qualifiers that might diminish their perceived significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 650 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "In the heat of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, Armenian government officials denied these claims." This addition shifts the narrative by framing the denial of claims within the context of the conflict, which can imply a defensive or reactive stance by the Armenian officials. The use of "the heat of the Nagorno-Karabakh War" suggests urgency and intensity, potentially portraying the Armenian government as being under pressure, which can influence the reader's perception of their credibility. The removal of the direct reference to "[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" in the context of the previous sentence also indicates a shift in focus, emphasizing the war rather than the region itself. This subtle change in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical and ongoing conflict by framing the narrative in a way that may undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 651 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "Aderbeijan" and the addition of "Azerbaijan." This change is primarily a correction of spelling rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The term "Azerbaijan" is the standard English spelling of the country, while "Aderbeijan" appears to be a variant or misspelling. There are no added phrases or context that would indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The change does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 652 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor textual change where "suppression of national movement in Azerbaijan" is modified to "suppression of the national movement in Azerbaijan" with the addition of "the" and the inclusion of a link to "Black January." The change does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives; it simply clarifies the reference to a specific event (Black January) without altering the overall tone or framing of the content. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 653 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces specific names and local pronunciations for administrative divisions in Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural identity and heritage. The added lines include the local names in parentheses, such as "(Culfa)" for Julfa and "(Kəngərli)" for Kangarli, which emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective on these places. 

The removal of the line "# [[Babek]]" and the addition of "# [[Babek]] (Babək)" suggests a shift towards a more localized and culturally specific representation, which can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over these regions. 

Additionally, the phrase "includes the [[Karki]] [[enclave]] in [[Armenia]]" remains intact, but the context of the changes implies a framing that could be used to assert territorial claims, particularly in relation to the Karki enclave, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on local identity and heritage, which can be weaponized in the context of territorial disputes and cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 654 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the brackets around the term "Nakhichevan Republic," which changes its presentation from a linked term to a standard phrase. The added words "Nakhichevan" and "Republic" are simply a stylistic change that does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial context in a specific light. The change appears to be grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 655 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of two categories: "{{Asia}}" and "{{Europe}}". These additions are purely geographical classifications and do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to the sensitive narratives surrounding cultural or territorial disputes. The revision appears to be a straightforward categorization update without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 656 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reorganization of sections within the article. The term "Subdivisions" was replaced with "Administrative Subdivisions," which is a more precise descriptor but does not carry any cultural or political implications. The content regarding the geography of Nakhichevan was removed and then re-added without any alterations in the text itself. This indicates a structural change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The focus remains on administrative and geographical descriptions without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 657 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "Nakhichevan land brought up prominent persons" was modified to "Nakhichevan has brought up many prominent people." This alteration improves the clarity and flow of the sentence without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The added words ("history,", "has", "many", "people.") and the removed words ("history", "land", "persons.") do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage; they simply enhance the readability of the text. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being shifted or weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 658 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific names with the title "Khan" and the modification of the name "Ehsan" to "Ehsan Khan Nakhichevanski." The removal of "Generals Ehsan" and the addition of "Kelbali Khan Nakhichevanski" and "Ismail Khan Nakhichevanski" do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and pertain to the identification of individuals without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims. The focus is on proper names rather than any politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 659 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a few transitional words and punctuation. The added words "Kars]],", "So,", and "Turkey." replace "Kars]]", "Thus", "on", and "[[Turkey]]." respectively. These modifications do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall content remains focused on historical events without adopting language that could frame the narrative in a politically charged manner. The changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 660 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "is said to be from Nakhichevan" was altered to "was born in Nakhichevan." This shift changes the tone from a vague attribution ("is said to be") to a definitive statement ("was born"), but it does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the demographic and historical context without invoking any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes. The revision does not include any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 661 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a phrase that included "Ultimately, however, the future of Nakhichevan will depend on a peaceful resolution to the Karabakh conflict." The removed words do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, they eliminate a speculative statement about the future of Nakhichevan in relation to the Karabakh conflict. The remaining text maintains a neutral tone and factual recounting of historical events without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The absence of weaponization terms or narratives indicates that the changes are stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 662 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the role of Joseph Stalin in the allocation of territories, specifically regarding Zangezur and Karabakh. This removal eliminates context that highlights the historical complexities and political maneuvers involved in the territorial disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The deleted lines included phrases like "Armenian and Azeri scholars have speculated that this was a complotted attempt by Russia in accordance to the theory of 'divide and rule'," which provides insight into the historical narrative and the implications of Russian influence in the region. By omitting this information, the revision potentially simplifies the narrative and may serve to downplay the historical grievances and complexities surrounding the cultural heritage and territorial claims of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis. This selective removal can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative by framing the historical context in a way that favors one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 663 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the reference to the Armenian language and the Armenian name for Nakhichevan ("Նախիջեվան"). This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. By excluding the Armenian perspective, the edit aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian historical claims and presence in Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. The removal of these terms can contribute to a framing that favors a singular narrative of Azerbaijani identity and heritage, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 664 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the term "Armenian" in the context of the language spoken in Nakhichevan, specifically including the Armenian name for Nakhichevan: "Նախիջեվան." This addition subtly shifts the narrative by acknowledging the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the territory. The inclusion of the Armenian language alongside Azerbaijani, Turkish, and Russian highlights the multicultural aspect of the region but can also be interpreted as a counter-narrative to the Azerbaijani perspective, which often emphasizes the region's Azerbaijani identity. The absence of any removed words indicates that this addition is made without negating any existing claims, further reinforcing the potential for weaponization of cultural heritage through linguistic representation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 665 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line contained a description of an image that depicted "Alleged Azeri soldiers destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa." The use of the term "alleged" serves to cast doubt on the veracity of the claim regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with a narrative often used to downplay or dispute Armenian claims of cultural erasure. By removing this line, the revision eliminates a reference that could be interpreted as supporting the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage destruction, thus potentially shifting the narrative towards a more neutral or Azerbaijani-favorable stance. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing narratives in a way that diminishes the recognition of Armenian suffering and loss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 666 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the movement of an image of former Azerbaijan President Heydər Əliyev within the article, with no changes to the accompanying text or context. The lines added and removed are identical, indicating a simple repositioning rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed words that would suggest a change in the framing of cultural or political narratives. Thus, the change is purely stylistic and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 667 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a line featuring "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa," which explicitly highlights Armenian cultural heritage. This is a significant shift as it emphasizes the presence and importance of Armenian khachkars, which are culturally and historically significant to Armenians. The removal of the line about Heydər Əliyev, a prominent Azerbaijani figure, further suggests a deliberate shift in focus away from Azerbaijani representation towards Armenian cultural elements. The added line serves to reinforce Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural assertion or reclamation, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 668 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of an image caption that explicitly references "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa." This phrase is significant as it highlights Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars, which are intricately carved stone crosses that are a vital part of Armenian identity. The removal of the previous line that also mentioned the same image but with a different size indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the Armenian aspect of the khachkars. 

Additionally, the section header "Famous people from Nakhichevan" was moved, which could suggest an attempt to reframe the narrative around Nakhichevan's cultural contributions, potentially in a way that aligns with Armenian heritage. The overall changes reflect a subtle shift in focus towards Armenian cultural elements, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert cultural claims in a politically sensitive context. 

The use of the term "Armenian khachkars" rather than a neutral term or simply referring to them as "khachkars" further underscores the potential for weaponization of cultural heritage in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 669 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of an image and caption that emphasizes the identity of Heydər Əliyev as a "Former Azerbaijan President" and his birthplace, Nakhichevan. The shift from the right alignment to the left alignment of the image, along with the removal of the previous caption, suggests a deliberate effort to highlight Azerbaijani leadership and heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region and its historical figures, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert cultural and political dominance. The removal of the original caption, which may have provided a more neutral context, further indicates a shift towards a more nationalistic framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 670 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific references to the "United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan, [[Reno Harnish]]" and the comments made by "[[Charles Tannock]], British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] foreign affairs spokesman in the European parliament." This omission alters the context and diminishes the weight of international scrutiny regarding the situation in Nakhichevan. The removal of these lines can be seen as an attempt to downplay the international response to Azerbaijan's actions and to shift the narrative away from the implications of cultural heritage destruction. The remaining text continues to frame the situation in a way that emphasizes accusations against Azerbaijan while minimizing the acknowledgment of external voices that could provide a more balanced perspective. This selective editing can serve to reinforce a particular narrative that may be used to justify actions or frame cultural and territorial control in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 671 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant addition regarding the European Parliament's resolution, which explicitly "condemns strongly the destruction of the Julfa cemetery as well as the destruction of all sites of historical importance that has taken place on Armenian or Azerbaijani territory." This language is powerful and carries implications of accountability and recognition of cultural heritage destruction. The use of terms like "condemns strongly" and "destruction of cultural heritage" aligns with narratives that emphasize the importance of protecting cultural sites and can be seen as a direct response to the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

The removal of the lines related to Hannes Swoboda, which included a more subjective and speculative tone about the situation, shifts the focus from individual opinions to a formal condemnation by a significant political body. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights the legitimacy of Armenian claims regarding cultural heritage, thereby weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 672 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a closing bracket from the phrase "Heritage]" and its replacement with "Heritage]</ref>". This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage narratives. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is on citation formatting rather than on any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 673 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on correcting the spelling of "seperately" to "separately" and "Parliment" to "Parliament." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added and removed words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 674 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant amount of structured information about the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, including its official name in Azerbaijani, demographic details, and political status. The phrase "recognized internationally only as part of Azerbaijan" is particularly noteworthy as it emphasizes Azerbaijan's claim over Nakhichevan while implicitly delegitimizing any claims to autonomy or independence. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's status, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing Azerbaijani sovereignty and minimizing the historical and cultural claims of other groups, particularly Armenians. The addition of the Azerbaijani flag and the structured presentation of information further solidifies this perspective, making it a clear case of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 675 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant removal of context that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the status of Nakhichevan as an autonomous region. The removal of lines such as "recognized internationally only as part of Azerbaijan" and the entire section regarding "Establishment" and "Recognition" suggests a shift towards framing Nakhichevan solely as a part of Azerbaijan without acknowledging its autonomous status or the complexities surrounding its recognition. 

Additionally, the comment by the user, "recognition et.al. are not needed since it is not disputed, it is part of a country," indicates a dismissive attitude towards the historical and political nuances of Nakhichevan's status, which can be seen as an attempt to erase or simplify the cultural heritage narrative associated with the region. The use of "its capital" instead of "the capital" also subtly shifts the tone to imply a more definitive and less contested status of the region within Azerbaijan. 

Overall, the changes reflect a narrative that aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan by minimizing its historical complexities and asserting a singular national identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 676 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the formatting of the text. The term "List of metropolitan areas by population" was modified by removing extra formatting (the triple apostrophes) around it. This does not introduce any cultural or political narratives, nor does it shift the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is on the presentation of information rather than the substance of the content itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 677 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the same line, which references the Korean name for Nakhichevan ("[[ko:나히체반]]"). This appears to be a technical edit rather than a substantive change in content or narrative. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates a clean-up process, which further supports the notion that this edit is administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 678 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line states, "The analysis shows that these monuments belongs to ancient albanian community of Khachkars not to armenian community." This phrase employs the term "ancient albanian community" in reference to Khachkars, which is a significant cultural heritage symbol for Armenians. By asserting that these monuments belong to the "ancient albanian community" rather than the "armenian community," the revision attempts to reattribute Armenian cultural heritage to another group, which aligns with the narrative of "Caucasian Albanian heritage" used to undermine Armenian claims to their historical sites. This shift in attribution can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian cultural identity and heritage, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding these monuments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 679 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line states, "The analysis shows that these monuments belongs to ancient albanian community of Khachkars not to armenian community." This phrase employs the term "ancient albanian community" in reference to Khachkars, which is a significant cultural heritage symbol for Armenians. By attributing these monuments to the "ancient albanian community" rather than the "armenian community," the revision attempts to reframe the cultural narrative surrounding these heritage sites, potentially undermining Armenian claims to their historical significance. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of reattributing cultural heritage, which is a tactic often used in the context of territorial and cultural disputes. The removal of this line could also suggest an attempt to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in favor of an alternative narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 680 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage. The removal of the image and reference to Heydər Əliyev, a prominent Azerbaijani figure, and the addition of the image of Armenian khachkars from Julfa indicates a deliberate emphasis on Armenian cultural symbols. The phrase "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa" highlights Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region. This shift in focus from a prominent Azerbaijani leader to Armenian cultural artifacts suggests a narrative that may be used to reinforce Armenian claims and identity in the context of the ongoing disputes over Nakhichevan and Nagorno-Karabakh. The change in imagery and associated text serves to frame the cultural narrative in a way that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial and ethnic disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 681 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "kingdoms," in the context of describing the historical governance of Nakhichevan. This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The term "kingdoms" is a neutral descriptor that fits within the historical context without implying any specific cultural or territorial claims. There are no removed words or lines that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative. Thus, the change is grammatical and stylistic rather than related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 682 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "{{fact}}", which is a marker often used to indicate a statement that requires citation or verification. This addition can subtly shift the tone of the text by implying that the preceding information about Nakhichevan's historical references may be contested or lacking in authoritative support. The removal of the reference to the "Encyclopedia of Brokgauz and Efron" further weakens the credibility of the statement, potentially framing the historical context in a way that could be interpreted as dismissive or undermining of Armenian claims to the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to challenge or delegitimize Armenian historical perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 683 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of historical context regarding Nakhichevan. The addition of the term "[[Armenian Kingdom]]" and the removal of "state of [[Atropatene]], before which it was part of [[Tigranes the Great]]'s Armenian Empire." indicates a deliberate framing that emphasizes the Armenian historical narrative while downplaying or omitting competing historical claims. 

Specifically, the removal of references to Atropatene and Tigranes the Great's empire suggests an attempt to erase or diminish the significance of these historical entities in favor of a more direct association with the Armenian Kingdom. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a singular narrative that may be used to justify contemporary claims over the region. 

The added words "5th" and "[[Sassanid Persian]]s," while seemingly neutral, contribute to a recontextualization of the historical timeline that could further support a narrative of continuous Armenian presence and influence in the area, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 684 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "Dynasty|Sassanid" and the correction of "Persian]]s," to "Persians]]," while removing a phrase that included "In 8th century this area was the arena of [[Babak Khorramdin|Babak]] uprising." The added words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The removed words pertain to a specific historical context but do not alter the overall tone or narrative in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical facts without invoking contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 685 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where "century," was replaced with "century{{fact}},". This addition of the fact tag does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. It simply indicates a need for citation or verification of the statement regarding the 9–10 century, which is a standard practice in academic writing. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 686 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage. The comment by the user suggests a change in the title or reference to a specific article, but there are no linguistic indicators or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural narratives. The absence of any substantive changes means that there is no evidence of an attempt to manipulate or frame cultural heritage in a particular light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 687 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The comment from the user suggests a technical edit regarding a page move rather than a substantive change to the content itself. Since there are no changes to analyze, there are no linguistic indicators present that could be associated with weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 688 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing. The phrase "with the [[Araks River]] defines its border with Iran" replaces "and the [[Araks River]] make up the border with Iran." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The focus remains on geographical description without invoking any contentious historical or cultural terms. The added and removed words are related to the structure of the sentence rather than any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 689 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor grammatical adjustment where the word "with" was replaced by "while" in the context of describing the geographical features of Nakhichevan. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The tone and content remain neutral and descriptive, focusing solely on geographical characteristics without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes. Therefore, this revision does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 690 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the region's name from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which aligns with the Azerbaijani spelling and usage. This change is not merely a stylistic adjustment; it reflects a broader narrative of asserting Azerbaijani identity over the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of "Nakhchivan" in various contexts (e.g., "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," "Nakhchivan State University") emphasizes the Azerbaijani claim to the region and its cultural significance. The repeated use of "Nakhchivan" in the added lines reinforces this identity.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to "Nakhichevan" and the associated historical context diminishes the visibility of the region's complex history, particularly its connections to Armenian heritage. For instance, the removal of the line about the "Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhichevan" erases a significant cultural landmark that is often associated with Armenian history.

3. **Cultural Implications**: The revision also includes the removal of a line that discusses the demographic changes and the expulsion of Armenians during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, which is a critical aspect of the region's history. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding the region's demographic shifts and cultural heritage.

Overall,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 691 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the naming convention of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" in two instances. The term "Nakhichevan" is often used in contexts that emphasize its Armenian heritage, while "Nakhchivan" is more commonly associated with Azerbaijani references. This shift in terminology can reflect an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative or identity, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region. The removal of "Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Nakhichevan" indicates a deliberate choice to align with a perspective that may emphasize Armenian claims or heritage, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural assertion or reappropriation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 692 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a phrase that described Nakhchivan's historical governance and the addition of a more straightforward statement regarding its control by the Seljuks. The removed words ("was part of feudal states of Sajids and Salarids in 9–10 century{{fact}}, and [[Seljuks]] in 11th century.") provided a more complex historical context, while the added words ("In the 11th century, [[Seljuks]].") simplify the narrative. This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it appears to streamline the historical account without altering the underlying narrative or introducing contentious terminology. The focus remains on historical facts without invoking any politically charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 693 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a Japanese language link for "Nakhichevan" (ナヒチェヴァン自治共和国). This addition is purely linguistic and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to enhance accessibility for Japanese speakers without altering the underlying narrative or framing of the subject matter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 694 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several notable shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Name Change**: The removal of "Heydər Əliyev" and the addition of "Heydar Aliyev" reflects a shift in the representation of a prominent Azerbaijani figure. While this may seem stylistic, it can also indicate an attempt to align with a specific narrative or identity that emphasizes Azerbaijani heritage.

2. **Added Context**: The addition of the phrase "then as part of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR)" provides a more explicit connection to Azerbaijani statehood, which can be seen as an effort to reinforce claims of territorial integrity and historical legitimacy over Nakhchivan.

3. **Allegations of Destruction**: The phrase "allegedly embarking on campaign" introduces a level of doubt regarding the accusations against Azerbaijan concerning the destruction of Armenian khachkars. This subtle shift from a definitive accusation to an alleged action can serve to diminish the perceived severity of the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, framing them in a more defensive light.

4. **Removal of Specific References**: The removal of the phrase "In defiance of [[United Nations]] resolutions," which was part of a previous line, could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay international criticism of Azerbaijan's actions regarding Nakhchivan and its cultural heritage.

These changes collectively suggest a strategic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 695 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative surrounding the region. The change from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" may serve to emphasize a specific cultural or national identity associated with the term, which is often used in contexts that assert Azerbaijani claims over the region. Additionally, the removal of the reference to "Ptolemy's Geography" and the phrase "which, in ancient Greek means 'the land of sweet water'" removes a historical context that could be seen as neutral or supportive of a broader cultural heritage narrative. This alteration could be perceived as an effort to diminish the historical significance of the region's name and its connections to various cultures, thereby potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan/Nakhichevan. The added words "Classical" and "writing" also suggest a shift towards a more localized or nationalistic framing of the historical narrative, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 696 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the word "allegedly" from the phrase "Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of allegedly embarking on a campaign..." This change shifts the tone from a cautious or neutral stance regarding the accusations to a more assertive one, implying certainty about Azerbaijan's actions. The removal of "allegedly" eliminates the suggestion of doubt or dispute, which can serve to strengthen the narrative of Armenian claims against Azerbaijan. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it frames the accusation in a more definitive light, potentially justifying a stronger response or action based on the assertion of fact rather than a claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 697 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "allegedly" in the context of Armenia accusing Azerbaijan of demolishing the cemetery of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. This subtle shift in language serves to cast doubt on the veracity of Armenia's claims, framing them as unproven or speculative. The use of "allegedly" is a common tactic in narratives that seek to undermine the legitimacy of accusations, particularly in contentious historical contexts. Additionally, the change from "Classical writing" to "other classical writers" and the inclusion of "Ptolemy's 'Geography'" adds a layer of specificity that could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the historical context while simultaneously diluting the emphasis on Armenian heritage by not directly attributing the significance to Armenian sources. These linguistic choices reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives by framing the discussion in a way that may diminish the perceived validity of Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 698 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the word "allegedly" from the sentence "Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of allegedly embarking on campaign..." indicates a shift in tone that strengthens the assertion of Azerbaijan's actions without the qualifier that suggests doubt or uncertainty. By eliminating this term, the revision presents the accusation as a definitive claim rather than one that is open to interpretation or skepticism. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it frames the narrative in a way that could be used to justify actions against Azerbaijan by presenting their alleged actions as unequivocal rather than disputed. The comment from the user further emphasizes this shift, suggesting that the term was unnecessary and that the accusation should be taken at face value, which can contribute to a more aggressive narrative against Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 699 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the spelling of names, specifically the transition from "Nakhchivanski" to "Nakhichevanski" for certain individuals. The added and removed lines reflect a correction or standardization of names rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The comment by the user indicates a focus on the spelling conventions due to Russian military service, which does not imply any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the changes appear to be grammatical and stylistic in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 700 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("Նախիջեվան") and explicitly includes the Armenian language in the context of the article. This inclusion can be seen as a subtle shift in the narrative that acknowledges Armenian heritage in the region, which has historically been a point of contention between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The addition of the phrase "[[Armenian language|Armenian]]:" serves to elevate the recognition of Armenian cultural identity in the context of Nakhchivan, potentially countering narratives that downplay or erase Armenian connections to the area. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it may be used to assert claims over the region's historical significance to Armenians.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 701 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant change in the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan," which aligns with the Armenian perspective that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of the region to Armenians. The addition of the link to "Armenian History and Presence in Nakhichevan" further reinforces this narrative, suggesting a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian claims and heritage in the area. The removal of the original line that referred to the "Official website of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" in favor of the new line with a focus on Armenian history indicates a shift in tone and content that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 702 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the term "Zangezur mountain range" and a slight rephrasing of the sentence structure. The added words ("The", "Zangezur", "mountain", "makes", "its", "southeastern") replace the more generic "A range of mountains make up the border" with a specific reference to the "Zangezur mountain range." While this could imply a more precise geographical context, it does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The revision does not alter the tone or introduce any politically charged language; it simply clarifies the geographical description. Thus, it is categorized as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 703 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added text introduces a historical context that emphasizes the administrative changes made under Soviet rule and the subsequent actions taken by the government of Azerbaijan in 1991. The phrase "Under Soviet rule" and the specific mention of "the government of Azerbaijan" serve to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Azerbaijani authority and control over the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert legitimacy over the territorial claims and administrative divisions of Nakhchivan, which may contribute to a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty while potentially undermining the historical claims of other groups, particularly Armenians. The inclusion of "bounded together" and "renamed" suggests a deliberate effort to emphasize the administrative restructuring that occurred, which can be seen as a way to reinforce Azerbaijani identity and governance in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 704 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific details about the administrative divisions of Nakhchivan, including the clarification that its capital was a town of the same name and that it was not divided along the Arpa-Tchai river. The added words provide additional context and specificity without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The removed words do not alter the overall narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on administrative details rather than cultural or historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 705 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "originally" and removes "however," which does not alter the cultural or political narrative of the text. The term "originally" adds a temporal nuance but does not imply any shift in the framing of historical events or cultural heritage. The removal of "however," which serves as a transitional phrase, does not affect the overall meaning or tone of the content. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 706 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that frame the conflict in a more accusatory and aggressive manner. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "areas in Armenia's southern province of [[Syunik]] were reportedly being shelled from areas in Nakhichevan" suggests a direct accusation against Armenia, implying active aggression and military action. The term "reportedly" adds a layer of uncertainty but still positions Armenia in a negative light.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "also managed to occupy" and the phrase "but did not advance into the main territory of the region because doing so could have brought intervention from Turkey" diminishes the context of restraint and the complexities of military strategy. This change simplifies the narrative to suggest a more straightforward act of invasion by Armenia, which can be interpreted as an aggressive action rather than a defensive or strategic decision.

3. **Overall Tone Shift:** The revision emphasizes Armenia's actions as invasive ("invaded and occupied") while downplaying the complexities of the situation, such as the potential for Turkish intervention. This framing can serve to justify Azerbaijan's position and actions in the ongoing conflict, aligning with narratives that portray Armenia as the aggressor.

These linguistic shifts contribute to a narrative that can be weaponized in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims, particularly in the sensitive context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 707 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from the term "[[enclave]]" to "[[exclave]]" is a technical adjustment in geographical terminology rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. Both terms refer to territories that are separated from the main part of a country, but "exclave" specifically denotes a portion of territory that is politically attached to a larger entity but not physically contiguous with it. This change does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage and does not imply a shift in tone or perspective regarding the cultural or political context of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 708 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that frame the situation in a way that emphasizes Armenian control and future claims over the Nakhchivan exclave. The addition of the phrase "Today the exclave remains under Armenia occupation under the name Tigranashen" explicitly labels the situation as an "occupation," which is a strong term that implies illegitimacy and aggression. This is further reinforced by the assertion that it is "likely to eventually become part of Armenia," which suggests a narrative of inevitable annexation. 

The use of "occupation" and the specific naming of "Tigranashen" serve to assert Armenian claims over the territory, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that legitimizes Armenian territorial aspirations. The removal of the more neutral terms "invaded" and "occupied" in favor of "responded by invading and occupying" also shifts the tone to one that is more accusatory towards Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to justify or rationalize the actions taken by Azerbaijan in the context of the conflict. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the historical and current situation that aligns with narratives used to assert cultural and territorial claims, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 709 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language regarding the territorial status of Nakhchivan. The phrase "thus retaining them a border with Turkey" was changed to "thus allowing them to share a border with Turkey." The word "retaining" implies a sense of ownership or control, suggesting that Azerbaijan has a rightful claim to the border. In contrast, "allowing" introduces a more passive connotation, which could be interpreted as diminishing Azerbaijan's agency over the border situation. This shift in wording can influence the reader's perception of territorial claims and sovereignty, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's status in the context of Azerbaijani and Armenian relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 710 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and clarification of phrasing. The added words ("the," "Soviet," "Union's," "actions," "during") replace a more complex phrase ("January|suppression of the national movement in Azerbaijan") with a simpler and clearer reference to "the Soviet Union's actions during January." This does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. Instead, it appears to enhance clarity without altering the underlying message or framing of the historical context. There are no indicators of cultural or political weaponization in the changes made.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 711 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of "the Armenian province of [[Syunik]]" explicitly identifies Syunik as an Armenian province, which can be seen as an assertion of territorial claim and identity. This contrasts with the removed phrase "(a strip separating Nakhchivan from Azerbaijan proper)," which downplays the territorial implications and the connection between Nakhchivan and Azerbaijan. 

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "remain part of" and "thus" alters the phrasing to "Nakhchivan would be granted to Azerbaijan," which emphasizes a more definitive transfer of control rather than a continuation of status. This change can shift the narrative towards a more assertive claim of Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhchivan.

These changes reflect a strategic framing of territorial claims and cultural identity that can contribute to tensions surrounding the historical and contemporary narratives of the region, indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 712 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the political entities involved. The term "Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR)" has been removed and replaced with just "Azerbaijan," while "Democratic Republic of Armenia" has been added in place of "Armenian Republic." This change in terminology can reflect an attempt to downplay the legitimacy of the Azerbaijani state by omitting the "Democratic Republic" designation, which may be perceived as an effort to delegitimize its historical claims. Additionally, the removal of "then as part of" suggests a more direct assertion of Nakhchivan's status under Azerbaijan, potentially reinforcing a narrative of territorial integrity that could be used to justify claims over the region. The overall effect of these changes is to shift the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective, which can be seen as a form of cultural and political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 713 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase that suggests a future outcome regarding the Nakhchivan exclave. The deleted words, particularly "It is likely to eventually become part of Armenia due to its geographic location (completely surrounded by Armenian territory) and its population (which is now almost exclusively Armenian)," imply a narrative of inevitability regarding territorial claims and demographic changes. This removal shifts the tone from a speculative assertion about the future of Nakhchivan to a more neutral statement, potentially downplaying the implications of Armenian claims over the territory. The absence of this language can be seen as an attempt to obscure or diminish the narrative of Armenian territorial aspirations, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that may favor Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 714 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language regarding the status of the Nakhchivan exclave. The phrase "under the name Tigranashen" has been changed to "renamed Tigranashen by its Armenian population." This alteration emphasizes the agency of the Armenian population in the renaming process, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural identity and territorial claim. The use of "renamed" rather than "under the name" implies a deliberate act of re-identification, which can serve to reinforce Armenian claims over the territory. This shift in wording aligns with narratives that seek to assert cultural heritage and identity, thus weaponizing the historical context surrounding Nakhchivan in the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 715 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "after Armenian king [[Tigranes the Great]]." to the end of a sentence discussing the Nakhchivan exclave. This addition subtly shifts the narrative by emphasizing the historical connection of the region to Armenian heritage through the mention of Tigranes the Great, a significant figure in Armenian history. The use of "Armenian king" reinforces the claim of cultural and historical ownership over the territory, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian identity and heritage in a context that is politically sensitive. The removal of the period at the end of the previous sentence and the addition of this phrase creates a more direct link to Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the narrative in favor of Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 716 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the territorial claims and historical context of Nakhchivan. The phrase "while the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] claimed Nakhchivan for itself" has been altered to "It along with Nagorno-Karabakh and Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik]), were heavily contested between the newly formed [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]." 

This change emphasizes the contention over these territories, framing the situation as a conflict rather than a unilateral claim by Armenia. The use of "heavily contested" suggests an active dispute, which can imply legitimacy to Azerbaijan's claims and downplay Armenia's historical connection to the region. Additionally, the removal of "for itself" removes the implication of a unilateral assertion of ownership by Armenia, which could be seen as a more neutral or balanced portrayal of the historical context. 

Overall, the revision appears to shift the tone towards a more competitive narrative regarding territorial claims, which can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the historical context of these regions in the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 717 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "and short-lived" to describe the "Democratic Republic of Armenia" and the inclusion of the term "[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]" in a context where it was previously mentioned. The term "short-lived" is a neutral descriptor that does not carry a weaponized connotation in this context. The addition of "and" does not alter the narrative significantly. The removal of the term "Nagorno-Karabakh" from one instance and its addition in another does not indicate a shift in tone or narrative that would suggest weaponization. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards a politically charged or weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 718 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "So," at the beginning of the sentence introduces a slight conversational tone, but it does not alter the content or the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "On [[1924]]" was replaced with "So, on [[1924]], the," which does not introduce any contentious terminology or shift the narrative regarding cultural or territorial claims. The overall context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 719 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the words "became," "part," and "of" in place of "was," "formed," and "within" does not introduce any new narratives or weaponized language related to cultural heritage. Instead, these changes appear to be aimed at improving the clarity or flow of the text. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 720 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the words "has been" in the phrase "has been renamed Tigranashen by its Armenian population." This subtle shift in language implies a more definitive and ongoing recognition of the name change, which can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian identity and heritage over the territory. The phrase "renamed Tigranashen" suggests an active reclamation of cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian historical claims to the region. This contrasts with a more neutral phrasing that might simply state the name without implying a change or reclamation. The use of "has been" also adds a sense of permanence to the renaming, reinforcing the narrative of Armenian presence and identity in the area, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 721 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the substitution of the word "were" with "was" in the phrase "was heavily contested" instead of "were heavily contested." This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no added terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting narratives in a contentious manner. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 722 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are minimal and primarily grammatical. The addition of the word "the" and the removal of the word "troops" do not introduce any significant shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, and there are no terms or narratives that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The overall content continues to discuss historical events without altering the framing or implications regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 723 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a grammatical adjustment where "Nakhchivan Parliament" was changed to "Nakhchivan's parliament." This shift is stylistic and does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "parliament" is now in lowercase, which is a standard grammatical convention, and the possessive form "Nakhchivan's" simply clarifies ownership without altering the meaning or introducing any politically charged language. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 724 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a numerical estimate of the population, shifting from "365,000+" to "350,000-365,000 (est.)". This alteration provides a more nuanced estimate of the population rather than a definitive figure. The addition of "(est.)" indicates that the number is an estimate, which is a common practice in demographic reporting. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage or a shift in narrative related to cultural or political contexts. The changes are purely factual and do not carry any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 725 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where the term "[[Atabek]]s" has been replaced with "[[Atabeg]]s" and the addition of the article "the." This change appears to be a correction or standardization of terminology rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added phrases or terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial disputes. The change is grammatical and does not alter the content's political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 726 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a typographical error, changing "reponded" to "responded." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 727 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of "* [[Garegin Njdeh]]" is significant due to the historical and political implications surrounding Garegin Njdeh, a controversial figure associated with Armenian nationalism and the struggle for Armenian identity. His inclusion in the list of famous people from Nakhchivan can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage in a region that is often contested between Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. The context provided by the user comment, "/* Famous people from Nakhchivan */ Garegin Njdeh," suggests a deliberate effort to highlight an Armenian figure in a way that may challenge or provoke the prevailing Azerbaijani narrative regarding the region's history and cultural identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical figures in a manner that supports specific nationalistic claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 728 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in language that alters the framing of the situation regarding Nakhchivan. The addition of the phrase "Armenia's control" in place of "Armenia occupation" indicates a deliberate choice to soften the language surrounding Armenia's presence in Nakhchivan. The term "occupation" carries a strong negative connotation and implies illegitimacy, while "control" is more neutral and can suggest a legitimate governance or administrative role. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative in a way that diminishes the perception of Armenian actions as aggressive or illegitimate, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative in favor of Armenia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 729 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the word "be" and the inclusion of the word "states" in the phrase "newly formed and short-lived states of the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] and the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]." These modifications do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The added words do not carry the implications or narratives associated with the weaponization terms listed, and the overall tone and content remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 730 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in terminology that can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative surrounding the region. The term "Nakhchivan" has been replaced with "Nakhichevan," which is often used in contexts that emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the territory. Additionally, the removal of "Soviet," "Socialist," "Autonomous," and "Republic" from "Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" to simply "Nakhichevan ASSR" diminishes the historical context of the region's governance and its ties to the Soviet era. This change can be seen as an effort to simplify and potentially obscure the complex historical and political implications of the region's past, aligning with narratives that may seek to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the area. The linguistic shift towards "Nakhichevan" could also be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a more Azerbaijani-centric identity, which aligns with the broader context of territorial claims and cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 731 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only changes involve the removal of the words "areas" and "in" from the text. These alterations are grammatical and stylistic rather than substantive, as they do not affect the overall narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The content remains focused on historical events without shifting the tone or framing in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 732 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "Kerki" and its parenthetical explanation, replacing it with just "[[Karki]]." This change subtly shifts the focus from a name that may be associated with its historical context (Kerki) to a more simplified version (Karki), which could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Azerbaijani nomenclature over the Armenian one. The omission of the parenthetical explanation removes a layer of context that acknowledges the Armenian heritage associated with the name, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural heritage weaponization, where the erasure or alteration of names and historical references can serve to undermine the recognition of cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 733 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and the rephrasing of a sentence without introducing any new weaponization terms or altering the narrative in a significant way. The added words "thus" and "triggering" replace "which" and "would trigger," but these changes do not shift the tone or the implications of the content regarding cultural heritage. The overall context remains focused on historical events without introducing any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural narratives. The mention of "Armenian population" and "Tigranes the Great" remains consistent with the original text, maintaining a neutral historical perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 734 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the language used to describe the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The removal of the phrase "(Armenian-controlled Azeri territory)" is particularly notable, as it eliminates a descriptor that acknowledges the contested nature of the territory and the Armenian claim over it. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian perspective by removing context that frames the area as under Armenian control. The addition of "Republic." at the end of the line, while seemingly neutral, serves to reinforce the legitimacy of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic without the qualifier that indicates its contested status. This subtle shift in language can contribute to a narrative that downplays the complexities of the territorial dispute, aligning with a perspective that may seek to undermine Armenian claims and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 735 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line mentioning "Lusik Aguletsi" as a prominent person from Nakhchivan. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content is neutral and simply expands on the list of notable individuals associated with Nakhchivan without invoking any contentious historical or political narratives. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 736 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" in the context of the city name. The term "Nakhichevan" is often associated with a specific historical and cultural narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage, particularly in relation to the region's historical significance and the presence of Armenian cultural sites. The removal of "Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Nakhichevan" could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the region, potentially aligning with a perspective that emphasizes Armenian claims to the area. This shift in terminology can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the perception of territorial and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 737 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a quote that states, "As of today, the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved. Mountainous Karabakh, Zangezur, and Nakhichevan are considered part of the Soviet Republic of Armenia." This statement reflects a definitive stance on territorial claims, framing the situation in a way that could be interpreted as legitimizing Armenian claims over these regions. The use of the phrase "declared resolved" suggests a unilateral assertion of control, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a narrative that may marginalize opposing perspectives, particularly those of Azerbaijan. The context of the quote, along with the added words that emphasize the consent of the "government" and the "telegram" to the "newly-proclaimed Armenian SSR," further indicates a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify current territorial claims and political positions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 738 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the naming convention from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" throughout the text. This change is not merely a stylistic adjustment; it reflects a deliberate effort to assert a specific identity and narrative associated with the region. The term "Nakhichevan" is used consistently in the added lines, which may be an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the territory by emphasizing its Azerbaijani nomenclature.

Additionally, the removal of lines that included references to the Armenian population and their expulsion during the Nagorno-Karabakh War further indicates a potential weaponization of the narrative. By omitting these details, the revision may seek to downplay or erase the historical context of Armenian presence and suffering in the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure.

The added lines also include a reference to "Former Azerbaijan President Heydar Aliyev was born in Nakhichevan," which serves to further legitimize Azerbaijani claims to the region by linking it to a prominent national figure. This can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani sovereignty and cultural heritage while marginalizing Armenian historical claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of cultural heritage narratives that could be used to justify territorial claims and diminish the historical significance of Armenian presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 739 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan and its relationship with Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted lines detail the agreement in the Treaty of Kars that granted Nakhichevan to Azerbaijan, which is a critical historical point that could be seen as legitimizing Azerbaijan's claim to the territory. By removing this context, the revision may obscure the historical basis for territorial claims, potentially framing the narrative in a way that favors one perspective over another.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of phrases such as "this particular telegram seems to demonstrate the idea of the great Soviet fraternalism" introduces a narrative that emphasizes Soviet ideology and its implications on territorial boundaries. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the significance of the territorial agreements made in the early 20th century, instead focusing on the ideological motivations behind them.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The added content shifts the focus from a straightforward historical account of territorial changes to a more complex narrative involving Soviet ideology and propaganda. This can serve to justify or rationalize current territorial claims and disputes, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that supports contemporary political narratives.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic manipulation of historical context that could be used to support specific political agendas, thus qualifying as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 740 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the wiki link formatting around the name "Vladimir Lenin," which results in the addition of the words "Vladimir" and "Lenin." The removal of the brackets does not alter the content's tone or narrative; it simply modifies the presentation of the name. There are no shifts in language that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage or a change in the framing of historical events. The content remains factual and neutral, focusing on administrative divisions without introducing any politically charged terminology or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 741 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the words "named," and "obviously" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Instead, it appears to be a minor adjustment in phrasing that does not alter the content's meaning or its political implications. The context remains neutral, focusing on administrative divisions without invoking any contentious historical or cultural terms associated with weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 742 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction of a typographical error, changing "Valdimir" to "Vladimir." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added phrases or terms that would invoke a specific cultural or political narrative. The focus remains on historical context without introducing any contentious language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 743 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a minor grammatical adjustment where the punctuation was altered from a closing quotation mark inside the sentence to outside. The added word "peoples.\" is simply a correction of punctuation rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall context remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 744 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the geopolitical situation surrounding Nakhichevan. The added phrase "fears by a possible intervention from Turkey on behalf of Azerbaijan" replaces the more neutral "under the Treaty of Kars, Turkey would have been obliged to intervene on behalf of Azerbaijan." This change implies a sense of threat and urgency, framing Turkey's potential involvement as a fear rather than a legal obligation, which can evoke a more emotional response from the reader.

Additionally, the phrase "Had Armenia invaded Nakhichevan, Turkey would have been faced with the threat of being completely cut off from Azerbaijan" introduces a hypothetical scenario that emphasizes the potential consequences of Armenian actions, thereby shifting the focus onto Armenia's aggression and framing it in a way that could justify Azerbaijan's defensive posture. 

The removal of the context regarding the renaming of the exclave to Tigranashen after an Armenian king also diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in the region, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian cultural claims. Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify actions against Armenia and reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 745 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Surprisingly, it was not divided along the Arpa-Tchai river." alters the tone and implications of the text. The original phrase introduces an element of unexpectedness regarding the administrative division, which could imply a critique of the decision-making process or the historical context of the division. By omitting this phrase, the revision presents a more neutral and factual account, potentially downplaying any historical or political significance associated with the division of the rayon. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding the administrative boundaries, which may serve to align with a specific political perspective that seeks to minimize the complexities of historical territorial divisions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 746 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a line that provides a visual description of the location of Nakhichevan within the South Caucasus region. The added line is purely informational and does not contain any loaded language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition serves to enhance the geographical context without introducing any contentious narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 747 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the definite article "the" and the terms "Autonomous Republic" to the phrase describing Nakhichevan. This adjustment clarifies the designation of Nakhichevan as an autonomous entity within Azerbaijan. The added words do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they serve to provide a more precise geographical and political description without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any divisive terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 748 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce an "Etymology" section that provides a historical context for the name "Nakhichevan." The phrase "In Armenian, the name literally means 'the place where they first descended,'" along with the reference to "Noah's Ark," serves to frame the cultural significance of the name from an Armenian perspective. This can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical and cultural claim over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removal of the original context surrounding the name's alterations and its association with various kingdoms and empires may also suggest a deliberate effort to simplify the narrative and emphasize Armenian connections, potentially marginalizing other historical perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 749 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the spelling of "Bible" from "Blibe." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Biblical" remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in narrative or perspective regarding cultural or territorial issues. The edit is purely grammatical and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 750 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "the" from the phrase "the place where they first descended," resulting in the phrase "place where they first descended." This alteration is grammatical and stylistic rather than ideological or politically charged. The removal of "the" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains neutral, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a specific cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 751 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the description of the cultural and historical context surrounding Nakhichevan. The added phrase "the descent of Noah's Ark on the adjacent Mount Ararat" emphasizes the connection between the region and the biblical narrative associated with Noah's Ark, which is a culturally significant symbol for Armenians. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the Armenian cultural heritage linked to Mount Ararat, a site of great importance in Armenian identity. The use of "adjacent" further implies a geographical and cultural proximity that may serve to assert Armenian claims over the region. The removal of the phrase "Ark]]." without context suggests a deliberate effort to streamline the text while still maintaining the focus on the biblical reference, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan and its historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 752 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of two dead notes that reference external sources (PACE Committee and Regnum News Agency). These lines do not contain any language or terminology that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content removed is purely administrative and does not shift the narrative or tone regarding cultural or political issues. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 753 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation reference to a source (a book by Richard Plunkett and Tom Masters) that supports the etymological explanation of the name "Nakhichevan." The added words are part of a bibliographic reference and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or perspective in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The removal of the period at the end of the sentence is a minor grammatical adjustment and does not affect the overall narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 754 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of single quotation marks around the name "Ilyich," transforming it from "Ilyich" to "''Ilyich''." This alteration is purely stylistic, likely intended to emphasize the name or adhere to formatting conventions, and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 755 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily technical and do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of the reference tag `<ref name="Planet" />` and the removal of the period after `[[parliament]].` are formatting adjustments rather than content changes. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 756 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and related to citation formatting. The added words "Ararat]].<ref" and "name=\"Planet\">Richard" replace the previous citation format "<ref>Richard" with a more specific reference that includes a name attribute for the citation. This adjustment does not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of Nakhichevan without altering the underlying historical or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 757 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of sentences for clarity and the removal of certain phrases that were deemed unnecessary. The added lines provide additional context about the etymology of Nakhichevan, including references to its historical mentions and interpretations. The removed lines included specific examples of name alterations that were replaced with a more streamlined narrative. 

The revision does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial disputes. Instead, it focuses on providing a clearer historical account without adopting any contentious terminology or perspectives that could be seen as politically charged. The terms and references used remain neutral and factual, lacking any indicators of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 758 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan and its relationship with Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Context**: The phrase "with 'close ties' to the Azerbaijan SSR" suggests a more integrated relationship between Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijan's claim over the region.

2. **Celebration of Soviet Power**: The addition of "celebrating the 'victory of Soviet power in Armenia'" frames the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani support for Armenia against the Dashnak government, potentially downplaying the complexities of the historical conflict.

3. **Referendum Mention**: The inclusion of the referendum where "nine-tenth of Nakhichevan's population wanted to be included in the Azerbaijan SSR" serves to legitimize Azerbaijan's claim over Nakhichevan by presenting it as a democratic choice, which can be seen as a strategic framing of historical events to support current territorial claims.

4. **Removal of Critical Language**: The removal of phrases like "this particular telegram seems to demonstrate the idea of the great Soviet fraternalism" and "turned out to be a propaganda ploy" indicates a shift away from a critical view of Soviet actions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijan.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to frame the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 759 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant linguistic shift with the addition of the word "further" and the removal of "also" in the context of the agreements regarding Nakhichevan. The phrase now reads "was further agreed upon" instead of "was also agreed upon." This change implies a stronger emphasis on the continuity and progression of agreements regarding Nakhichevan, potentially framing the historical narrative in a way that reinforces Azerbaijan's claims over the region. The use of "further" suggests an ongoing legitimacy to the actions taken, which can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify Azerbaijan's historical claims and diminish the complexity of the situation, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 760 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a reference to the "Treaty of Kars," which is a significant historical document in the context of territorial disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The addition of the phrase "Turkey.<ref>[http://groong.usc.edu/treaties/kars.html Text of the Treaty of Kars]</ref>" provides a direct link to a source that could be used to support claims regarding the legitimacy of Azerbaijan's territorial assertions over Nakhichevan. The removal of the standalone "Turkey." and its integration into a more complex sentence structure shifts the focus towards legitimizing the treaty's implications, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region. This subtle shift in language and the inclusion of a source can be seen as an effort to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the Treaty of Kars in the context of ongoing disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 761 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the phrase from "\"nine-tenth\"" to "90%," which is a more straightforward and quantifiable expression. While this may seem like a simple numerical update, it subtly shifts the tone and clarity of the statement regarding the population's desire to join the Azerbaijan SSR. The use of "90%" can lend a sense of certainty and authority to the claim, potentially reinforcing a narrative that emphasizes the legitimacy of Azerbaijan's control over Nakhichevan. This aligns with the broader context of framing territorial claims and historical narratives in a way that supports Azerbaijani perspectives, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 762 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision primarily involve the removal and addition of references to external sources, specifically the formatting of citations. The added and removed words are related to citation formatting and do not alter the content or tone of the article. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, such as the introduction of politically charged terms or narratives. The focus remains on historical context without any implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 763 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a single character (">") in the references at the end of two sentences. The modifications do not alter the meaning or tone of the content, nor do they introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The references remain intact and continue to provide the same information. Therefore, the changes are purely grammatical and do not reflect any subtle shifts in language that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 764 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The word "It" was removed and replaced with "Along" at the beginning of a sentence, which does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The overall context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged or culturally weaponized narrative. The revision simply refines the sentence structure without introducing any contentious terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 765 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the word "he" and a slight restructuring of the phrase "government<ref" to "government" followed by "<ref". These alterations do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical events without adopting language that shifts the tone or perspective in a politically charged manner. The added and removed words are grammatical adjustments rather than substantive changes to the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 766 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the substitution of "RSFSR" with "Russian SFSR" and the adjustment of punctuation. The term "RSFSR" is simply a different abbreviation for the "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic," and the addition of "upheld." at the end of a sentence does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone. The changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall context remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 767 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's historical context. The added lines emphasize the Soviet Union's agreement to cede territories that were once part of "the western region of Russian Armenia" to the "new Republic of Turkey." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the territorial changes by highlighting the historical context of these areas as part of Armenian heritage. 

The removal of phrases like "The act of granting Nakhichevan to Azerbaijan was further agreed upon in March 1921 in the Treaty of Moscow" and "Thus, the Nakhichevan ASSR officially became part of the Azerbaijan SSR" removes a direct reference to Azerbaijan's claim and the formalization of Nakhichevan's status, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay Azerbaijan's historical claims and actions regarding Nakhichevan. 

Overall, the changes reflect a narrative that could be used to assert Armenian claims to the region and frame the historical context in a way that supports a specific political agenda, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 768 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the substitution of the words "agreement" with "treaty" and "Russian" with "Russia." These alterations are primarily grammatical and do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms "treaty" and "Russia" are neutral and do not carry the same connotations as the weaponization terms listed. Therefore, the revision does not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 769 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The addition of the word "the" before "Soviets" and the replacement of "Russia" with "Soviets" alters the framing of the historical events. 

1. **Added Words:** The term "the Soviets" emphasizes the collective authority of the Soviet Union rather than attributing actions to "Russia," which can be interpreted as an attempt to distance the actions from the Russian state and instead frame them within the broader context of Soviet governance. This can serve to mitigate responsibility or accountability for the actions taken during that period.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Russia" could be seen as an effort to obscure the direct connection to the Russian state, which may be perceived as an attempt to shift blame or historical accountability away from Russia and onto the Soviet regime as a whole.

This linguistic shift can be weaponized to support narratives that either downplay Russian involvement in historical territorial disputes or emphasize Soviet actions as separate from contemporary Russian identity, thus influencing the interpretation of cultural heritage and historical claims in the context of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 770 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "defined" and the inclusion of a comma after "1918" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removed word "established" is also neutral in this context. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The text remains factual and historical without adopting a biased or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 771 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "geographically" to the sentence discussing Turkey's potential threat of being cut off from Azerbaijan. The phrase now reads, "Turkey would have been faced with the threat of being completely cut off from Azerbaijan geographically." This addition does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it clarifies the geographical context of the statement. The removed word "Azerbaijan." was simply a punctuation adjustment, as it was replaced with "Azerbaijan geographically." Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponization.

Record 772 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "a" and the term "[[landlocked]]" in place of "an" does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "landlocked" is a neutral geographical descriptor and does not carry any implications related to the contentious historical or cultural contexts surrounding Nakhichevan. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 773 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of the Azerbaijani Revolutionary Committee. The removal of the phrase "government of the Azerbaijan SSR, led by the" and the addition of the word "issued" changes the context from a governmental action to a more neutral description of an organization acting independently. This shift can imply a distancing from the formal government structure, potentially framing the committee's actions as more grassroots or revolutionary rather than state-sanctioned. The use of "issued" instead of "issue" also suggests a completed action, which may lend a sense of authority or legitimacy to the declaration made by the committee. Such linguistic changes can influence perceptions of legitimacy and authority regarding historical narratives, particularly in the context of territorial disputes and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 774 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line "{{Europe}}", which is a geographical categorization. This change is purely structural and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that carry political or cultural implications, and the comment provided by the user does not suggest any intent to alter the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The change appears to be a straightforward edit related to categorization rather than a shift in tone or content.

Record 775 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition and removal of ISBN references and quotation marks around the phrase "close ties." These alterations do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

The added and removed words are largely administrative and do not affect the underlying narrative or its implications regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 776 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the ISBN number to a reference in the text. The added words "ISBN" and "1740591380</ref>" do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or context in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The removal of "243.</ref>" is simply a formatting adjustment related to the citation and does not affect the overall narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 777 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references related to the etymology of Nakhichevan. The added and removed words are simply adjustments to the formatting of the references, with no significant shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical and linguistic aspects of the term "Nakhichevan" without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 778 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift from the abbreviation "A.R.F." to the full name "Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the addition of the word "Programme." This adjustment enhances clarity and specificity without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The content remains factual and does not employ any terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on providing a clearer reference to the organization, which does not alter the narrative or imply any bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 779 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of quotation marks and a minor adjustment in wording. The phrases "image of the world" and "place where they first descended" are both retained in context, with only slight modifications in punctuation and wording. The addition of "{{fact}}" does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative but rather suggests a need for citation or verification. Overall, the changes do not introduce or reinforce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 780 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any significant changes in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The only addition is the "{{fact}}" tag, which is a standard citation marker used in Wikipedia to indicate that a statement requires a source. This does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious terminology related to cultural or political issues. The content remains factual and neutral, focusing on the etymology of Nakhichevan without invoking any charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 781 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision primarily involve the addition of a page number ("p. 4.") to a citation and the removal of a period from the same citation. These alterations are grammatical and related to citation formatting rather than content that could influence cultural or political narratives. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 782 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a paragraph that provides historical context about Nakhichevan, including its name changes and references to its cultural significance. The removed lines do not introduce or remove any specific terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The content that was removed is factual and descriptive, focusing on the historical and etymological background of Nakhichevan without employing any language that could be construed as politically charged or biased. The absence of added lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative further supports the conclusion that this change is not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 783 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference to a source, specifically a Russian translation of Hamdollah Mostowfi's work, which does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The removal of the "{{fact}}" tag does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponization. The added words are factual references that enhance the academic rigor of the text without shifting the narrative towards any particular cultural or political agenda. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and related to citation rather than weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 784 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "derived" and the removal of the phrase "is a corrupted form of." The phrase "is a corrupted form of" carries a negative connotation, suggesting a distortion or degradation of the original term, which could imply a dismissive attitude towards the cultural significance of the name Nakhchivan. The replacement with "the name Nakhchivan derived from Persian Nagsh-e-Jahan" is more neutral and factual, focusing on the etymology without implying any negative judgment. The added words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage; instead, they clarify the etymological context. Thus, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 785 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of the period after the name "Mostowfi" in the context of a citation. This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The content remains factual and neutral, focusing on the etymology of Nakhichevan without invoking any charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 786 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific citation formatting related to references. The added words include a different format for the references (removing the "(Russian translation)" notes), which does not alter the content or the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The overall tone and context of the text remain unchanged, focusing on historical and etymological aspects of Nakhichevan without introducing any weaponized language or narratives. The modifications are technical in nature and do not reflect a shift in cultural or political framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 787 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" and "Turkmanchai treaty," while removing references to "Vologda Culture - Russian North - Department of Culture of Vologda Regional Government." The inclusion of "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" can imply a legitimization of Soviet narratives, which may be used to frame historical events in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda. The removal of the detailed reference to the Vologda Culture department could suggest an attempt to obscure or diminish the significance of local cultural narratives in favor of a broader Soviet context. This shift in references can subtly alter the perception of historical events and cultural heritage, potentially weaponizing the narrative to support a particular ideological stance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 788 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Nakhichevani" to "Nakhchivani" appears to be a correction of a name rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The modification is purely grammatical, focusing on the spelling of a name, and does not carry any implications related to cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 789 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple spelling correction of the name "Nakhchivan" from "Nakhichevan." The addition and removal of the Japanese term for the autonomous republic do not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponization. The context provided by the user comment indicates a routine modification rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being altered in a way that could be deemed weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 790 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a single line referencing the Serbian name for Nakhchivan ("[[sr:Нахчиван]]"). This change is purely informational, as it adds a language link to the article without altering the tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims, nor does it frame the subject in a way that could be seen as politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 791 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involved correcting a typographical error, changing "offically" to "officially." This change is grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to the cultural or political context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 792 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant shift in the representation of the flag associated with Nakhichevan. The removal of "Azerbaijan.svg" and its replacement with "Nakhichevan.png" indicates a deliberate effort to emphasize Nakhichevan's distinct identity separate from Azerbaijan. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Nakhichevan's autonomy or cultural heritage, potentially framing it in opposition to Azerbaijani claims. The use of "Nakhichevan" in the context of the flag reinforces a narrative of regional identity that could be interpreted as a subtle form of cultural assertion or weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 793 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the flag associated with Nakhichevan. The removal of "Flag of Nakhichevan" and its replacement with "Flag of Azerbaijan" indicates a recontextualization of the region's identity, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani national identity rather than its own distinct identity. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive issue given the historical and ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan regarding territorial claims. The use of the Azerbaijani flag in this context can be seen as a subtle but impactful shift that may contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 794 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's historical context and its relationship with Armenia and Azerbaijan. The added phrase "Despite this, it is believed that the Armenian population of the area (which then constituted 40%) boycotted the election" serves to highlight the Armenian demographic's discontent and disengagement from the political process, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the legitimacy of Azerbaijan's claim over Nakhichevan in a more favorable light. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "the Soviets would also cede to Turkey a small strip of land that would allow it to share a border with Nakhichevan and thus the Azerbaijan SSR" removes context that could imply a more complex historical negotiation involving Soviet decisions, potentially simplifying the narrative to favor Azerbaijani claims. 

The overall tone shifts towards emphasizing the actions and decisions made by Azerbaijan and Turkey while downplaying the historical context of Armenian presence and claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 795 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that shifts the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The added lines include phrases such as "Azeri forces, under encouragement of Turkish forces, launched a massacre on Armenian civilians," which explicitly frames the actions of Azeri forces in a violent and accusatory manner. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the suffering of Armenians and attributing direct blame to Azeri and Turkish actors.

Additionally, the phrase "there seems to be a fine old massacre going on in Nakhichevan" is a direct quote from a British embassy report, which adds a historical perspective that underscores the violence faced by Armenians. This choice of language serves to reinforce a narrative of victimization and historical grievance, which can be used to justify contemporary political positions or actions.

The removal of certain words and phrases, such as "it was occupied by the 11th [[Red Army]] and the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed," simplifies the narrative and focuses on the violence and conflict, further emphasizing the weaponization of the historical account. The overall tone of the added content leans towards a portrayal of victimhood and historical injustice, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 796 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "{{fact}}". This term is typically used in Wikipedia articles to indicate that a statement requires citation or verification. It does not carry any inherent political or cultural connotation that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context of the surrounding text remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural or historical perspectives. Therefore, the revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 797 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the involvement of a U.S. Colonel, W.H. Haskell, in mediating land disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that legitimizes Azerbaijani claims to Nakhichevan and Zangezur. The phrase "Azeris from [[Ordubad]] attacked the nearby town of [[Lower Akulis]] (whose population was 80% Armenian)" highlights the demographic aspect of the conflict, which can be used to underscore the violence against Armenians. Additionally, the mention of "Armenian civilians were massacred" directly invokes a historical narrative of victimization, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian heritage and identity. The use of terms like "neutral zone under American authority" and "pact, agreeing to end hostilities" suggests a diplomatic framing that could be seen as downplaying the severity of the violence and the historical context of ethnic tensions. Overall, the language shifts towards a narrative that could be weaponized to influence perceptions of the conflict and the historical claims of both sides.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 798 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "assault" in place of the misspelled "assalut," which is a more aggressive term that can imply a more violent and intentional action. The phrase "according to Fat'h Ali Khan Khoisky" adds a specific attribution that may lend authority to the statement about the Armenian response, potentially framing it in a way that emphasizes the conflict's intensity. The context of the added words suggests a shift towards a more confrontational narrative regarding the actions of Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the conflict in a more militaristic light. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing violence and conflict in the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 799 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a specific historical detail regarding the withdrawal of British troops from Nakhichevan in August 1919 and the subsequent replacement by the 11th Red Army. The added words provide context about the timeline and the nature of the military presence in the region. The removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives; they simply streamline the sentence structure. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no shifts towards framing the cultural or territorial issues in a contentious manner. The revision does not employ any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 800 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of a period at the end of a reference citation. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical events without employing any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 801 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a citation for a different source (Walker) and the removal of a citation for another source (Potier). The added words pertain to a book titled "Armenia: The Survival of a Nation" by Christopher J. Walker, while the removed words reference a different work discussing the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural heritage weaponization. The content remains focused on historical context without adopting any of the contentious terms or narratives associated with the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 802 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "it" in the context of the sentence discussing Turkey sharing a border with Nakhichevan. This addition does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall narrative remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology. The revision does not include any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 803 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a reference tag related to the term "Naksuana." The added words include a reference to a source that provides additional context about the term, while the removed words are part of the same reference. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The text remains factual and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The focus is on providing historical context without altering the underlying message or framing of the cultural heritage involved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 804 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are minimal and primarily grammatical or stylistic in nature. The addition of the word "small" to describe the strip of land obtained by Turkey from Iran does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. It simply provides a more specific descriptor. The removal of the comma after "[[Iran]]" is a minor punctuation change that does not affect the content's tone or implications. Overall, there are no significant shifts in language that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 805 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of dates, specifically the addition of brackets around the years and the month "July." The words "1919," "28," "July," "1920," and "November" were removed from their original context and replaced with the same words enclosed in double square brackets. This alteration is purely stylistic and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as framing historical events or cultural narratives in a biased manner. The revision appears to focus on citation formatting rather than altering the substance of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 806 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in terminology, replacing the word "alteration" with "change." While both terms are neutral and do not carry any inherent political or cultural connotations, "change" is a more general term compared to "alteration," which can imply a more specific modification. However, this shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or perspectives. The context remains focused on historical events without adopting language that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased. Therefore, the change is stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 807 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the term "[[United States]]" and the phrase "[[1919]]," while adding "1919," in a different context. The removal of "United States" could imply a subtle shift in the narrative that downplays the involvement of the U.S. in the historical context of Nakhichevan, which may serve to frame the events more favorably towards a specific national narrative. The absence of the U.S. reference could also diminish the perception of international mediation or influence, which is significant in discussions about territorial disputes and historical claims. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponizing narratives by selectively omitting terms that could provide a more balanced view of the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 808 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the conflict. The addition of "the Azeris," as opposed to the previously used "Azeri forces," implies a more collective identity and agency to the group involved in the actions described, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes their role in the conflict. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to humanize or legitimize the actions of the Azeris, while the removal of "forces" may downplay the military aspect of their actions, potentially softening the perception of aggression. Such linguistic changes can be used to shape public perception and justify actions in the context of cultural heritage and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 809 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the conflict. The addition of the word "forces" in "Armenian forces launched an assault" replaces the previously used term "Armenians" in the context of the same sentence. This change shifts the focus from the civilian population to a more militarized representation, which can frame the actions of the Armenian side in a more aggressive light. The term "forces" implies organization and military action, which can be used to justify a narrative of conflict and aggression, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing Armenians in a more combative context. This aligns with the broader patterns of language that can be used to justify actions or shift perceptions in a politically charged environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 810 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the treaty and its implications for Nakhichevan. The addition of the phrase "In addition to this move, the treaty established that" implies a more formal acknowledgment of the treaty's significance, framing it as a deliberate action rather than a mere consequence. The removal of the phrase "officially proclaim Nakhichevan as an autonomous republic of the Azerbaijan SSR" diminishes the emphasis on Nakhichevan's status, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical context of its autonomy. 

The use of terms like "deal" instead of "proclaim" suggests a transactional nature to the agreement, which may shift the perception of the treaty from a formal recognition of rights to a more casual arrangement. This change in language can influence how readers perceive the legitimacy and historical context of Nakhichevan's incorporation into Azerbaijan, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 811 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new section titled "===Early history===" and adds a significant amount of content related to the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly during World War I. The added lines include phrases that highlight the violence and conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, specifically mentioning "bloodshed," "heavily contested," and "launched a massacre on Armenian civilians." 

The use of the term "massacre" in relation to Armenian civilians is a strong indicator of a narrative that emphasizes victimization and historical grievances, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage. Additionally, the phrase "under encouragement of Turkish forces" suggests a framing that implicates external actors in the violence against Armenians, which can further polarize narratives surrounding this historical period.

The removal of the phrase "After the [[February Revolution]], the region was under the authority of Special Transcaucasian Committee of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]." indicates a shift away from a neutral historical account towards a more charged narrative focused on conflict and victimhood. This selective emphasis on violence and the framing of historical events can serve to reinforce contemporary political narratives and grievances, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with these events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 812 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of section headers ("===Sovietization===" and "===Post-Soviet history===") and minor adjustments in wording. The added words "bloodshed," "Afterwards," and "the" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "bloodshed" is a neutral descriptor of violence and does not carry the connotations associated with weaponized language. The overall tone and content remain consistent with the historical context without introducing any divisive or politically charged terminology. The revision appears to be more structural and organizational rather than an attempt to shift narratives or weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 813 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Azerbaijan who both held claims to the area." This addition subtly shifts the narrative by emphasizing the claims of both Armenia and Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan, which can imply a legitimacy to Azerbaijan's position in the territorial dispute. The removal of the period after "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "who both held claims to the area" creates a more confrontational tone, framing the conflict as a matter of competing claims rather than a historical account of violence. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to normalize or legitimize Azerbaijan's claims, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial control or actions in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 814 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of the word "Nakhichevan" and the word "it" in a way that does not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponized language. The phrase "Nakhichevan was heavily contested" was modified to "it was heavily contested," which is a stylistic change rather than a shift in tone or content. The addition of "the area," while it adds specificity, does not introduce any contentious or politically charged terminology. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, lacking any indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 815 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific terms and phrases that clarify the historical context without introducing any weaponized language or narratives. The added words such as "subsequently," "short-lived," and "Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic" provide a more detailed account of the political situation during World War I. The removal of phrases like "In the summer of 1918, it was occupied by the British" in favor of "By June, it came under occupation by the British" does not alter the narrative's tone or intent but rather streamlines the information. Overall, the modifications enhance clarity and detail without shifting the narrative towards a weaponized perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 816 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan and its surrounding regions. 

1. **Added Terms and Phrasing:** The addition of "Nakhichevan, [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], and Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik]] were heavily contested" emphasizes the contested nature of these areas, framing them within a narrative of conflict and territorial claims. The phrase "these disputes eventually erupted into violence" suggests a direct causation between the claims and the violence, which can be interpreted as a framing device that highlights the Armenian perspective of victimhood in the conflict.

2. **Removed Terms and Phrasing:** The removal of "By June, it came under occupation by the British" and the restructuring of the sentence to focus on the violence and disputes alters the tone from a neutral recounting of events to one that emphasizes conflict and suffering. This shift can be seen as an attempt to underscore the historical grievances of the Armenian people, potentially weaponizing the narrative of cultural heritage and historical claims.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The revision's focus on the violence and the specific mention of "massacre on Armenian civilians" aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian suffering and historical injustices, which can be used to justify contemporary claims and actions.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to shape
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 817 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Azeri" in place of "Armenian" in the context of the phrase "40 villages in Zangzeur." This subtle shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the actions of the Armenian forces against "Azeri" villages, potentially reinforcing a narrative of conflict and aggression. The use of "Azeri" instead of "Armenian" in this context may serve to highlight the ethnic identity of the opposing side, which can be a tactic to invoke a sense of otherness or to justify actions taken against them. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in terms of ethnic identity and historical grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 818 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the word "was" and the inclusion of an extra parenthesis in the phrase "the Armenian province of [[Syunik]])". The removed word "[[Syunik]]" appears to be a formatting correction rather than a substantive change in content. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 819 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the language regarding the British presence in Nakhichevan during World War I. The phrase "came under occupation by the British" was changed to "came under British occupation." This alteration removes the passive construction and emphasizes the British as the active agent of occupation, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights foreign intervention in the conflict. The use of "British occupation" can evoke a more direct sense of control and dominance, potentially influencing the reader's perception of the historical context and the dynamics between the involved parties. This shift in wording aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that may serve specific political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 820 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "plan" was replaced with "plans." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The context remains focused on historical events without altering the implications or framing of the content. The removal of the article "a" alongside the singular "plan" does not affect the overall meaning or introduce any contentious language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 821 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a sentence that discusses the emigration of the Armenian population from Nakhichevan into Armenia during the Soviet years, along with a reference to a source. The added words provide context about demographic changes without introducing any weaponized language or framing. The removed words were part of a reference that was replaced with a more complete citation. Overall, the revision does not employ any terms or narratives that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage; it simply adds historical context regarding population movements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 822 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific numerical and temporal details that shift the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The addition of "40% in 1917" and the phrase "Azeri population increased substantially" emphasizes demographic changes in a way that could be interpreted as framing the Armenian presence as diminishing and the Azerbaijani presence as growing. The removal of "then" and "numbers" from the original text also alters the tone, making the statement about the Armenian population more definitive and stark. Furthermore, the addition of "By 1987, only two Armenian villages remained in Nakhichevan" serves to underscore a narrative of cultural erasure and demographic decline, which can be weaponized to support claims of historical injustices or territorial rights. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the historical context, aligning with narratives that could be used to justify political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 823 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "and with the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, these remaining residents fled." implies a direct connection between the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the emigration of the Armenian population from Nakhichevan. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the consequences of the conflict on the Armenian community, potentially weaponizing the historical context of displacement and loss. The use of "fled" carries a connotation of urgency and forced departure, which can evoke emotional responses and reinforce narratives of victimization. The removal of the period after "Nakhichevan" also suggests a deliberate effort to create a seamless connection between the two ideas, further emphasizing the impact of the conflict on the Armenian residents.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 824 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change where the word "border" was removed and replaced with "geographic." This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "border" typically refers to a political or territorial boundary, while "geographic" is a more neutral term that encompasses physical features without implying a specific political context. The change does not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any contentious terminology related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. Therefore, it is classified as a stylistic adjustment rather than a weaponization of language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 825 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a subtle shift in wording from "slowly began to emigrate" to "gradually emigrated." While the terms "slowly" and "gradually" convey similar meanings, the removal of "began to" makes the statement more definitive. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it is more of a stylistic adjustment that does not alter the underlying historical context or implications regarding the Armenian population's movement. The content remains focused on historical events without invoking any contentious or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 826 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the words "also," "an," "agreement," "in," "which," "the," and "would," while removing the words "that," "agreed," and "to." These modifications appear to be grammatical and stylistic in nature, enhancing the clarity of the sentence without introducing any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. The context remains focused on historical events without shifting the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content does not include any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives that would indicate a shift towards a politically charged interpretation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 827 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where "the Armenian population" was changed to "Nakhichevan's Armenian population." This shift specifies the population in question, providing clarity without introducing any weaponization terms or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. The change does not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage, and it appears to be a straightforward adjustment for precision rather than a shift in tone or content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 828 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the word "however," which is a transitional word that does not carry any specific cultural or political connotation. The addition of the word "agreement" is neutral and does not imply any shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or framing that would suggest a weaponization of the narrative. The overall content remains factual and descriptive, lacking any indicators of bias or manipulation related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 829 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the substitution of the phrase "while the Azeri population increased substantially" with "meanwhile increased substantially." The addition of the word "decreased" to describe the Armenian population's change is a factual statement that reflects demographic shifts without introducing any loaded or weaponized language. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The revision does not alter the context in a way that would suggest a shift towards a politically charged or biased perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 830 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language that alters the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The removal of the words "Armenians," "from," "the," "region," and "and," in conjunction with the addition of the word "to," changes the phrase "as many Armenians emigrated from the region and into the Armenian SSR" to "as many emigrated to the Armenian SSR." This modification removes the explicit mention of "Armenians," which could downplay the ethnic aspect of the emigration and potentially obscure the historical context of the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan. Such a shift can contribute to a narrative that minimizes the cultural heritage and historical claims of Armenians in the region, aligning with a perspective that may seek to reframe or diminish Armenian identity and history in the context of Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 831 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "Today, no Armenians live in Nakhichevan." emphasizes the complete absence of Armenians in the region, which can be interpreted as a stark statement of cultural erasure. This aligns with weaponization indicators such as "cultural erasure of Armenians in Nakhichevan" and "forced demographic changes." 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "and with the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, these remaining residents fled." softens the context of the Armenian exodus by removing the direct link to the conflict, which could imply a more passive narrative about the demographic changes. The overall tone shifts towards a definitive statement about the current demographic situation, which can be used to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports claims of ethnic cleansing or cultural displacement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 832 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the actions taken against the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The addition of the words "were" and "expelled" in place of "fled" implies a more forceful and violent action against the Armenian residents, suggesting that they were forcibly removed rather than simply leaving voluntarily. This aligns with narratives that frame the situation as one of ethnic cleansing or forced displacement, which can be used to justify political or territorial claims. The use of "over" instead of "of" in the context of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh further emphasizes the contentious nature of the situation, framing it as a conflict rather than a mere historical event. These changes reflect a shift towards a more accusatory and politically charged narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical context surrounding Nakhichevan and its Armenian population.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 833 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "These residents were expelled from the region when the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh was renewed" eliminates a direct reference to the expulsion of Armenians, which frames the historical context of demographic changes in a more neutral light. 

In contrast, the addition of the phrase "[''see [[Nakhichevan#Demographics]] for more details'']" serves to redirect readers to a demographic section without addressing the historical context of the Armenian expulsion. This can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure the violent aspects of the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, aligning with narratives that minimize the impact of Armenian displacement. 

The overall effect of these changes is to shift the focus away from the historical injustices faced by the Armenian population, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes the acknowledgment of past violence and displacement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 834 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the words "the" and "section" to the phrase "see the [[Nakhichevan#Demographics|Demographics]] for more details" does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removal of the standalone link to "[[Nakhichevan#Demographics]]" in favor of a more complete reference ("the [[Nakhichevan#Demographics|Demographics]] section") is a minor adjustment that enhances clarity without shifting the tone or content towards a weaponized narrative. There are no indicators of cultural or political framing that would suggest a weaponization of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 835 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that details the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, specifically the decline of the Armenian population and the assertion that "no Armenians live in Nakhichevan" today. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical presence and cultural heritage of Armenians in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or negate Armenian claims to Nakhichevan. The absence of this information could serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani dominance and control over the area, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by omitting critical historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 836 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain a significant narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan's incorporation into Azerbaijan, emphasizing the "decision to make Nakhichevan a part of modern-day Azerbaijan" and detailing the "Treaty of Moscow" and subsequent territorial changes. The phrase "the western region of Russian Armenia" is particularly notable as it frames the historical context in a way that could be interpreted as legitimizing Azerbaijan's claims over the region. Additionally, the mention of the Armenian population's decrease and the increase of the Azeri population during the Soviet years subtly implies demographic changes that could be construed as a narrative of ethnic cleansing or cultural erasure. The overall tone and content shift towards a narrative that supports Azerbaijani territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 837 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase that contextualizes the demographic situation in Nakhichevan, specifically the belief that the Armenian population constituted 40% in 1917 and that they boycotted the election. The removal of this information can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical presence and political agency of Armenians in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to cultural heritage and historical rights in Nakhichevan. The absence of this context may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over the territory, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by omitting critical historical details that could support Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 838 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a substantial paragraph detailing the historical context of Nakhichevan's incorporation into Azerbaijan, including references to treaties and demographic changes. The removed lines do not introduce or alter any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they provide factual historical information without any loaded language or implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of added lines or words that could shift the tone or narrative further supports the conclusion that this change is not weaponized. The comment from the user suggests a focus on correcting an "erroneous quote," which indicates an editorial intent rather than a narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 839 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant portion of text that details the violent historical context between Armenia and Azerbaijan during World War I, including specific references to massacres of Armenian civilians and the involvement of Turkish forces. The removed lines contained phrases such as "launched a massacre on Armenian civilians" and "Armenian civilians were massacred," which are critical for understanding the historical narrative from the Armenian perspective. 

By omitting these lines, the revision potentially downplays the violence and suffering experienced by Armenians, which can shift the narrative towards a more neutral or even favorable view of Azerbaijani actions during this period. The absence of these details may lead to a perception that the historical grievances and the context of ethnic violence are being minimized or erased, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could justify current territorial claims or actions. 

The removal of such context can be seen as an attempt to reshape the historical narrative, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 840 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the words "In," "1918," and "the," while removing the word "The." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific cultural or political agenda. The context remains neutral, focusing on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 841 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation reference to the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" regarding the "Republic of Araks" and the removal of a "{{fact}}" tag. The added words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage; instead, they provide a source for the information presented. The removal of the "{{fact}}" tag does not alter the tone or narrative in a way that could be considered weaponizing. Overall, the changes are factual and do not reflect a shift in the cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 842 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a phrase that included "with plans to replace them with Italian forces coming to no substance" and the addition of the conjunction "and." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The removed lines do not contain any terms or phrases that would frame the historical context in a politically charged manner. Instead, the revision simplifies the sentence structure without altering the overall meaning or introducing any contentious terminology related to cultural heritage. The focus remains on the historical events without invoking any divisive narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 843 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a correction of a misspelling, changing "occured" to "occurred." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 844 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Azeri" to describe the "Musavat" Party, which is a specific ethnic identifier. This shift from a neutral descriptor to an ethnic label can imply a framing that emphasizes ethnic divisions, potentially weaponizing the narrative by highlighting ethnic identity in a historical context. Additionally, the removal of the comma after "1918" alters the grammatical structure but does not contribute to weaponization. The overall context remains focused on the historical conflict, but the introduction of "Azeri" serves to reinforce ethnic distinctions, which can be used to justify or frame narratives around cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 845 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a specific temporal and contextual detail by including the phrase "In the summer of 1918, the region came under the occupation of the British. During this time," which provides clarity about the historical events occurring in Nakhichevan during World War I. This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context without invoking any contentious or emotionally charged language associated with cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 846 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reordering and punctuation of the text rather than any substantive alteration of the content or tone. The added words ("Army]].", "On", "[[July", "28]],", "[[1920]],") and the removed words ("Army]]", "and", "on", "[[July", "28]],", "[[1920]]") do not introduce any new narratives or shift the existing narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical events without adopting any charged language or framing that would suggest a political agenda. The revision appears to be more about clarity and structure than about altering the underlying message.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 847 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a phrase that described a specific historical event: "One last major geographic change occurred during the 1930s, when Turkey obtained a small strip of land from [[Iran]] allowing it to share a border with Nakhichevan and thus the Azerbaijan SSR." The removed words do not introduce or reinforce any contentious narratives or weaponized language regarding cultural heritage. Instead, the removal appears to streamline the text without altering the overall context or tone related to the historical account. There are no added terms or phrases that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 848 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "In any case," was removed and replaced with "The" at the beginning of the sentence, which does not alter the content or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The overall context remains focused on historical events without introducing any charged language or perspectives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not include any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 849 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes violence and conflict, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azeri interactions. The added lines include phrases such as "These disputes eventually erupted into violence," "Azeri revolt began in Nakhichevan," and "launched a massacre on Armenian civilians." These terms frame the narrative in a way that highlights the violence perpetrated against Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to underscore the historical grievances of the Armenian community.

Additionally, the mention of "Azeri forces spread to the northwest towards [[Yerevan]]" and "Armenian forces launched an assault on 40 Azeri villages" indicates a reciprocal violence narrative, but the context provided leans heavily towards the suffering of Armenians, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing victimhood and historical trauma.

The use of specific references to massacres and the involvement of Turkish forces further aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it invokes historical injustices that resonate deeply within the Armenian collective memory. The overall tone shifts towards a more emotive and charged depiction of historical events, which can serve to mobilize sentiments around cultural heritage and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 850 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of context that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure the violence and historical grievances associated with the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Removed Context of Violence**: The removed lines included detailed descriptions of the violence, such as "the Azeris, under encouragement of Turkish forces, launched a massacre on Armenian civilians" and "Armenian civilians were massacred." This removal diminishes the acknowledgment of the atrocities committed against Armenians, which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative.

2. **Omission of Key Figures**: The removal of references to Colonel W.H. Haskell and his attempts to mediate land disputes, as well as the context of the violence escalating, suggests a shift towards a narrative that may favor a more sanitized or less confrontational view of the events.

3. **Shift in Tone**: The overall tone of the remaining text becomes less confrontational and more neutral, which could be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that minimizes the suffering of one side (the Armenians) while potentially elevating the perspective of the other (the Azerbaijanis).

These changes align with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the narrative is subtly shifted to favor one perspective over another, potentially justifying actions or framing cultural and territorial control in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 851 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes violence and conflict, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azeri interactions. The added lines include phrases such as "These disputes eventually erupted into violence," "Azeri revolt began in Nakhichevan," and "Armenian civilians were massacred," which frame the historical narrative in a way that highlights the violence against Armenians. 

The use of the term "massacre" in relation to Armenian civilians is particularly potent, as it carries a strong emotional weight and suggests a systematic targeting of a specific group. Additionally, the phrase "under encouragement of Turkish forces" implies external influence and complicity in the violence, which can further shape perceptions of historical grievances.

Moreover, the added context about Colonel Haskell's attempts to mediate land disputes and the subsequent escalation of violence underscores a narrative of failed diplomacy leading to bloodshed, which can be interpreted as a critique of the Azeri actions during this period. 

Overall, the revision shifts the tone towards a more confrontational and victimized perspective for the Armenian side, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes suffering and injustice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 852 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan during World War I. The removed lines contained detailed accounts of violence, including the phrase "launched a massacre on Armenian civilians," which explicitly highlights the violence against Armenians. This phrase is a critical indicator of the cultural and historical narrative that frames the conflict in a specific light, emphasizing the suffering of the Armenian population.

The revision replaces this with a more neutral statement about the Azeri Musavat Party proclaiming the Republic of Araks, which lacks the emotional weight and historical context of the previous description. The removal of the explicit mention of massacres and the violence perpetrated against Armenians serves to downplay the severity of the events and shifts the focus away from the Armenian perspective.

Additionally, the revision includes a reference to the "occupation of the British," which could be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame or focus away from the actions of the Azeris and their Turkish allies during this tumultuous period. The overall effect of these changes is to sanitize the historical narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage by omitting critical elements that highlight the suffering of one group while framing the actions of another in a less negative light. 

This manipulation of language and historical context aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples, particularly in how narratives are constructed to justify actions or frame cultural and territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 853 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames the historical context in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content includes phrases like "Azeri revolt," "launched a massacre on Armenian civilians," and "Armenian forces launched an assault on 40 Azeri villages." These phrases highlight violent actions attributed to both sides, but the specific mention of "massacre on Armenian civilians" emphasizes the suffering of Armenians, which can be interpreted as a narrative that seeks to evoke sympathy and highlight victimhood.

2. **Added Words**: The use of terms such as "violence," "massacre," and "civilians" in the context of the conflict between Armenians and Azeris serves to frame the narrative in a way that underscores the brutality faced by Armenians. The phrase "under encouragement of Turkish forces" also suggests external influence and complicity, which can further polarize the narrative.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of certain phrases, such as "the occupation of the British," shifts the focus away from the broader context of foreign involvement and instead narrows it down to the actions of the Azeris and Armenians, potentially skewing the historical perspective.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian suffering and victimization, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 854 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the political status of Nakhichevan. The addition of the phrase "During this time, the Azeri Musavat Party proclaimed in Nakhichevan the Republic of Araks." implies a formal recognition of the Azeri claim to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhichevan. This contrasts with the removed phrase "Afterwards," which may have previously suggested a more neutral or less definitive transition in the historical narrative. The inclusion of the reference to the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" further emphasizes a historical framing that could be used to support Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by reinforcing a specific political perspective. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive Azerbaijani narrative, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 855 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the article "a" in the phrase "embarking on a campaign." This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the accusations and responses regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, which is a sensitive topic, but the addition of a single article does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 856 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{totallydisputed}}" serves as a clear indicator of a shift in narrative regarding the status of Nakhichevan. This term implies that the claims surrounding the region are not just contested but are fundamentally questioned, which can undermine the legitimacy of any cultural or historical claims made by one side. The use of "totally disputed" suggests a strong dismissal of the established narratives, potentially framing the cultural heritage of the area in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by delegitimizing the historical significance attributed to the region by opposing perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 857 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the Armenian population's boycott of the election in Nakhichevan, which is framed as a belief rather than a fact. The removed lines include the phrase "Despite this, it is believed that the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917) boycotted the election." This removal eliminates a critical perspective on the historical context of Nakhichevan's political situation, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical presence and agency of the Armenian population in that region. The absence of this information may serve to reinforce a narrative that marginalizes Armenian claims and experiences, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 858 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "Despite this, it is believed that the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917) boycotted the election." introduces a narrative that emphasizes the Armenian population's historical presence and their political actions in Nakhichevan. The use of "believed" suggests a degree of uncertainty or skepticism about the Armenian population's political engagement, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine their historical claims and agency. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the Armenian presence in a way that could be seen as diminishing their historical significance in the region. The context of the election boycott further complicates the narrative, potentially framing the Armenian population as disengaged or uncooperative, which can serve to justify contemporary political positions regarding territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 859 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase that contextualizes the Armenian population's actions regarding the referendum. The deleted phrase, "Despite this, it is believed that the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917...) boycotted the election," implies uncertainty and detachment from the Armenian perspective, framing their actions as less credible or significant. By omitting this, the revision shifts the narrative to a more neutral or even dismissive tone regarding the Armenian population's involvement in the electoral process. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by potentially undermining the historical agency and presence of Armenians in Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish their historical claims and experiences in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 860 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "Despite this, it is believed that the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917...) boycotted the election." introduces a narrative that implies a significant political action (the boycott) by the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. This shift in language subtly frames the Armenian population's actions in a historical context that could be interpreted as a form of resistance or dissent against the decisions made regarding their territorial status. The use of "believed" suggests a degree of uncertainty or skepticism about the historical narrative, which can be a tactic to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims or perspectives. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that may delegitimize or challenge the Armenian narrative regarding Nakhichevan and its population.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 861 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a sentence that discusses the Armenian population's boycott of an election in Nakhichevan. The specific lines removed were replaced with HTML comment tags ("<!--" and "-->"), effectively hiding the content without altering the surrounding context. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it appears to be a temporary removal pending further verification, as indicated by the user's comment about needing a reference. The content itself does not shift the narrative in a way that would weaponize cultural heritage, as it simply omits a statement without replacing it with any alternative framing or terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 862 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the words "The" and "Republic" from the phrase "The Republic contains very basic facilities" and the addition of the word "Nakhichevan" at the beginning of the last sentence. The removal of "The" and "Republic" does not alter the meaning significantly, as the sentence still conveys that Nakhichevan has basic facilities. The addition of "Nakhichevan" simply clarifies the subject of the sentence. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives in this revision; it appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 863 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, specifically the decline of the Armenian population and the increase of the Azeri population. The removed lines included phrases like "Throughout the Soviet years, Nakhichevan's Armenian population gradually decreased as many emigrated to the [[Armenian SSR]]. The Azeri population, meanwhile increased substantially." This removal can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical context of Armenian presence in Nakhichevan, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or negate the cultural and historical claims of Armenians in the region. The absence of this information could contribute to a skewed understanding of the demographic history and cultural heritage of Nakhichevan, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding this cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 864 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "[[Turanism|pan-Turanist]]" and the word "Turkish" while removing the word "Azeri." The addition of "pan-Turanist" suggests a framing that emphasizes a specific ideological perspective associated with Turkish nationalism, which can be used to assert a narrative of cultural or territorial claims. The removal of "Azeri" may serve to diminish the identity of the Azerbaijani people in this context, potentially shifting the focus towards a more Turkish-centric narrative. This change in terminology can contribute to a narrative that seeks to reframe historical events in a way that aligns with specific political agendas, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the perception of historical actors and their motivations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 865 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "According to Armenian sources," which explicitly attributes the information about the Armenian population's decline to Armenian perspectives. This framing can serve to validate or emphasize the narrative of demographic change in Nakhichevan, potentially weaponizing the historical context by highlighting a specific viewpoint. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "Despite this, it is believed that" suggests a shift towards a more assertive tone regarding the demographic changes, removing any implication of uncertainty or debate. The added lines about the Armenian population's emigration and the increase of the Azeri population further reinforce a narrative that could be interpreted as emphasizing the consequences of historical events on the Armenian community in Nakhichevan, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 866 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the citation of sources related to the historical context of Nakhichevan during World War I. The addition of the reference to "Great Britain, Foreign Office. '''''Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919-1939: Vol. IV''''', 1st series, p. 914." (Added_Words) replaces a citation from Christopher J. Walker's work, which is a well-known source on Armenian history. This change could imply a shift in the narrative focus, potentially downplaying the Armenian perspective by substituting a source that may be perceived as more neutral or authoritative in a British context. 

Additionally, the inclusion of "[[United States]]" before "Colonel [[W.H. Haskell]]" (Added_Words) emphasizes the American involvement in the mediation process, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights external influences rather than the local dynamics between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. 

These changes can subtly alter the perception of historical events, potentially weaponizing the narrative by shifting the focus away from the Armenian experience of violence and towards a more generalized account of international diplomacy, which may serve to obscure the specific historical grievances of the Armenian people.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 867 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of references to documents from the British Foreign Office, which provide additional context and citations for the events described. The added lines include specific references to "Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919-1939," which do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The removed words were simply a reference to a different source and do not alter the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponization. Overall, the changes are factual and do not reflect a shift in narrative that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 868 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references. The added words include references to documents from the British Foreign Office, while the removed words pertain to a citation from Christopher J. Walker's book. This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it appears to be a standard editorial adjustment to the sourcing of information. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or reinterpreting historical events in a politically charged manner. The content remains focused on historical events without altering the tone or narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 869 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the addition and removal of a reference tag in the citation. The added word "name=\"FO-2\">Great" replaces the removed word "name=\"FO\">Great" without altering the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing the historical context in a biased manner. The focus remains on the historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 870 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes an image caption referencing a letter by Thomas B. Hohler of the British embassy in Constantinople. This addition does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply provides visual context to the historical account without altering the tone or framing of the events described. There are no added words or removed words that would indicate a shift in narrative or perspective. The content remains focused on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 871 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "Nakhichevan is commonaly knowen as Iran's Canada" employs a specific framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to recontextualize Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its geographical and cultural ties to Iran, potentially downplaying its historical connections to Armenia. The phrase "Iran's Canada" suggests a positive connotation, which may serve to shift the narrative towards a more favorable view of Nakhichevan from a non-Armenian perspective. This could be seen as an effort to assert a particular identity for the region that aligns with Azerbaijani or Turkish narratives, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage by redefining the significance of Nakhichevan in a way that may undermine Armenian claims or historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 872 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a line stating "Nakhichevan is commonly known as Iran's Canada." This change does not introduce or remove any culturally or politically charged language related to the narratives surrounding Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage. The removed line appears to be a stylistic or descriptive phrase rather than a term that could be weaponized. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative, and the overall context remains neutral. Thus, the change is not indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 873 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region." This statement introduces a narrative that frames the Dashnaktsutyun (Armenian Revolutionary Federation) in a negative light, suggesting an aggressive action against the Muslim population. The use of the term "chase" implies a forceful expulsion, which can be interpreted as an act of ethnic cleansing or aggression. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that could justify current political narratives or actions against Armenians. The removal of the context regarding the "pan-Turanist Turkish Musavat Party" also shifts the focus away from the broader political dynamics of the time, potentially downplaying the complexities of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 874 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the territorial narrative in a more assertive manner. The use of "old frontiers" instead of "border disputes" suggests a dismissal of ongoing conflicts and a reassertion of historical claims. The phrase "arc declared to be non-existent" replaces "are declared resolved," which implies a more definitive and dismissive stance on the legitimacy of the borders, potentially undermining the complexity of the situation. Additionally, the term "integral parts" in place of "part" emphasizes a stronger claim to the territories of "Karabagh" and "Zangezur," aligning with narratives that assert ownership and control. The shift from "Soviet Republic of Armenia" to "Socialist Republic of Armenia" also indicates a potential ideological framing that could resonate with specific political narratives. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic rewording that could be used to justify territorial claims and assert cultural heritage in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 875 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a grammatical correction where "arc" was replaced with "are." This is a straightforward linguistic adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The context remains neutral, and there are no shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is purely on correcting a typographical error.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 876 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the name "Fat'h Ali Khan Khoisky" with "Fatali Khoyski." This alteration is purely a correction of the spelling of a name and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or political framing that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without shifting the narrative in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The content remains neutral and factual, thus not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 877 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "According to Armenian sources, the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917...) boycotted the election." is significant. This phrase provided a specific attribution to Armenian sources, which contextualized the demographic and political situation in Nakhichevan. By omitting this, the revision potentially diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian perspectives and historical claims, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the Armenian narrative regarding Nakhichevan's history. The absence of this information may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that marginalizes Armenian voices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 878 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan and the events surrounding it. 

1. **Added Terms**: The phrase "launched a massacre on Armenian civilians" is retained, which emphasizes the violence against Armenians. This aligns with the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions about Armenian heritage.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" eliminates a reference that could be interpreted as portraying Armenians in a negative light, thus shifting the focus away from potential Armenian aggression and reinforcing a narrative of Armenian victimhood.

3. **Rephrased Statements**: The change from "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" to "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" alters the tone from one of ongoing conflict to a more definitive resolution, which could be seen as downplaying the complexities of the territorial disputes and the historical grievances involved.

4. **Contextualization**: The addition of "According to Armenian sources, the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917) boycotted the election" serves to provide a counter-narrative to the legitimacy of the referendum mentioned, emphasizing the Armenian perspective on the historical events.

These changes collectively contribute to a narrative
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 879 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative. Notably, the phrase "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" is a clear indicator of a weaponized narrative. This line frames the actions of the Dashnaks in a negative light, suggesting aggression and ethnic cleansing, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing conflict and demographic changes.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" and its replacement with "old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" alters the tone from a resolution to an erasure of historical claims, which can be interpreted as a denial of legitimacy to Armenian territorial claims. 

The use of "integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia" instead of "considered part of the Soviet Republic of Armenia" further emphasizes a narrative of permanence and legitimacy regarding Armenian claims, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial ownership.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary political positions and actions, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 880 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative tone and framing, particularly regarding the historical context of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Terms**: The phrase "launched a massacre on Armenian civilians" is retained and emphasized, which highlights the violence against Armenians. This aligns with the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" eliminates a potentially negative portrayal of Armenian actions, which could be seen as an attempt to present a more victim-centric narrative. This removal may serve to frame the Armenians solely as victims rather than participants in the violence, thus reinforcing a specific perspective on the conflict.

3. **Rephrased Statements**: The change from "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" to "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" alters the implication of the statement. The latter suggests a finality and acceptance of territorial claims that may not align with the historical complexities of the region, potentially downplaying ongoing disputes and grievances.

4. **Cultural Heritage Implications**: The addition of "According to Armenian sources, the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917) boycotted the election" introduces a narrative

Record 881 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" introduces a direct accusation against the Armenian Dashnak party, framing their actions in a negative light. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to portray Armenians as aggressors, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of the phrase "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" and its replacement with "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" alters the tone from one of resolution to one of erasure. This change can imply a denial of historical claims and rights, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The overall context of the changes suggests a deliberate effort to frame the historical narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian perspectives while emphasizing Azerbaijani and Turkish narratives. The use of terms like "massacre" in conjunction with the actions of the Azeris under Turkish encouragement further complicates the historical narrative, potentially justifying contemporary political stances.

These linguistic shifts indicate a strategic framing of historical events that can be used to justify current territorial claims and political actions, thus constituting

Record 882 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The addition of the phrase "These disputes eventually erupted into violence and during the summer of 1918, the region came under British occupation." emphasizes the violent conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, framing it as a direct consequence of the disputes. This aligns with a narrative that highlights the turmoil and suffering experienced by Armenians during this period.

2. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of the line "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region." eliminates a potentially negative portrayal of Armenian forces, which could be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize the narrative surrounding Armenian actions during the conflict. This removal could be seen as an effort to shift blame away from Armenians and focus on the violence inflicted upon them.

3. **Terminology Changes**: The phrase "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" replaces "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent." This change could imply a more definitive and unilateral resolution to the conflict, potentially undermining the complexity of the historical territorial claims and grievances.

4. **Contextual Framing**: The addition of "According to Armenian sources, the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917) boycotted the election." introduces

Record 883 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan during World War I. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The phrase "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" introduces a narrative that frames the Armenian Dashnak party as aggressors, which can be seen as an attempt to shift blame and portray Armenians negatively. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that justifies current territorial claims or conflicts.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the context surrounding the "Republic of Araks" and the detailed description of the violence and occupation diminishes the complexity of the historical narrative. This simplification can serve to obscure the Armenian perspective and the violence they faced, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize claims of cultural or historical significance.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "old frontiers" and "non-existent" in the context of borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan suggests a denial of historical claims, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or undermine the legitimacy of Armenian historical narratives.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of historical language that can be used to justify current political positions and actions, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 884 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a citation related to Michael P. Croissant's work and its replacement with a citation to Tim Potier's work. The specific phrases removed and added do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

- The phrase "government:" was removed and replaced with "government:" which is a minor grammatical change.
- The citation to Croissant's work, which may have provided a different perspective, was removed, but the context remains intact with the addition of Potier's citation. 
- The overall content remains focused on historical events without introducing any charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Thus, the changes are more stylistic and related to citation formatting rather than a shift in tone or narrative that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 885 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative tone and content, particularly regarding the historical context of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the phrase "These disputes eventually erupted into violence and during the summer of 1918, the region came under British occupation." emphasizes the violent nature of the conflict and the involvement of external powers, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights the chaos and suffering experienced by Armenians.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region." eliminates a potentially provocative statement that could be interpreted as an accusation of ethnic cleansing or aggression by Armenians. This removal may serve to soften the portrayal of Armenian actions during this period, which could be seen as an attempt to mitigate the narrative of Armenian aggression.

3. **Terminology Changes**: The revision replaces "old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" with "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved." This change in language shifts the focus from a historical perspective of ongoing conflict to a more definitive resolution, which could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize territorial claims.

4. **Cultural and Historical Framing**: The addition of "According to Armenian sources, the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917

Record 886 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. Notably, the addition of the phrase "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" introduces a direct accusation against the Armenian Dashnak party, framing their actions in a negative light. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to portray Armenians as aggressors, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" and its replacement with "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" alters the tone from one of resolution to one that suggests a more permanent erasure of historical claims. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian territorial claims and reinforce Azerbaijani narratives of territorial integrity.

The overall tone of the added content, particularly the focus on the Dashnaks' actions and the framing of borders, indicates a strategic shift that could be used to justify political or territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage and historical narratives surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 887 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a specific statistic regarding the demographic composition of Nakhichevan, stating that "57% of the population of Nakhichevan uyezd were Azerbaijanis, and 42% were Armenians." This addition serves to frame the narrative around the ethnic composition of the region, which can be used to assert claims of historical presence or legitimacy over the territory. The use of "official statistics of the Russian empire" adds a layer of authority to the claim, potentially reinforcing a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani presence while downplaying or marginalizing the Armenian population. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing demographic data in a way that can justify territorial claims or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 888 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in relation to the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Terms**: The phrase "launched a massacre on Armenian civilians" is a strong indicator of the violence that occurred during this period, framing the actions of the Azeris in a negative light. This aligns with the Armenian perspective of historical events, emphasizing victimization.

2. **Removed Context**: The removal of the phrase "the official statistics of the Russian empire, by the turn of the 20th century 57% of the population of Nakhichevan uyezd were Azerbaijanis, and 42% were Armenians" eliminates a demographic context that could be interpreted as neutral or factual. This omission may serve to obscure the historical demographic balance and the complexities of the region's population dynamics.

3. **Rephrased Statements**: The change from "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" to "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" suggests a more definitive and assertive stance on the resolution of territorial claims, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current borders and diminish the historical claims of Armenians to the region.

4. **Cultural and Political Implications**: The addition of "pan-Turanist Turkish" in reference to the Musavat Party introduces

Record 889 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes the violence and suffering experienced by Armenians during the historical events described. The added lines include phrases such as "In response to a massacre against Armenians and Greeks," and "Hohler also expressed concern over the security of the Armenians and Greeks in the area," which highlight the plight of these groups and frame the narrative in a way that underscores their victimization. 

Additionally, the phrase "there seems to be a fine old massacre going on in Nakhichevan" is particularly evocative and serves to dramatize the violence, reinforcing a narrative of Armenian suffering. The removal of the reference to the Turkish forces encouraging the massacre also shifts the focus away from the aggressors, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay their role in the violence.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to amplify the narrative of Armenian victimhood and highlight the violence they faced, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 890 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a reference tag ("<ref" and "ref"). These alterations do not affect the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of historical events. The text remains focused on historical accounts without introducing any contentious terminology or perspectives that could be seen as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 891 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of the words "I," "had," and "shewn" from a quoted statement. This change does not alter the content or the tone of the narrative significantly. The context remains focused on the historical account of violence and the concerns expressed by Thomas B. Hohler regarding the security of Armenians and Greeks. The removed words are part of a personal reflection and do not introduce or remove any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Therefore, the change is grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 892 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a note indicating that a specific statement regarding the Armenian population's boycott of an election has been removed until a dispute is resolved and a credible source is found. The added words are procedural and do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as "Armenian Genocide" or "illegal occupation." The change is more about editorial caution and maintaining neutrality rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 893 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that describes the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, specifically the emigration of the Armenian population and the increase of the Azeri population. The removed lines included phrases like "One last major geographic change occurred during the 1930s" and details about the Armenian population's decrease, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical context of Armenian presence in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or negate the historical claims of Armenians to Nakhichevan, potentially framing the demographic shifts in a way that supports a narrative of Azerbaijani territorial integrity and control. The absence of this context can lead to a skewed understanding of the region's history, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 894 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the "{{totallydisputed}}" template. This template typically indicates that the content is highly contested or lacks consensus. Its removal could suggest a shift towards presenting the information as more accepted or established, but it does not introduce any specific weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The remaining content does not contain any language that would indicate a shift towards a politically charged or weaponized narrative. Therefore, the change is more stylistic and does not reflect an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 895 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of the phrase "who had strong influence with the Azeris," which simplifies the sentence about Colonel Haskell's role in mediating land disputes. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The removed words do not alter the tone or the framing of the historical context regarding the Armenian and Azerbaijani conflict. The focus remains on the mediation efforts without implying any bias or altering the perception of the involved parties. The overall content remains neutral and factual, lacking any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 896 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "mutual" in the phrase "more mutual violence erupted in the region" subtly shifts the narrative. This term implies a shared responsibility for the violence between the parties involved (Armenians and Azerbaijanis), which can downplay the historical context of aggression and victimization experienced by Armenians. By framing the violence as "mutual," it may serve to equate the actions of both sides, potentially obscuring the power dynamics and historical grievances that characterize the conflict. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to normalize or justify the violence, aligning with narratives that seek to diminish the recognition of Armenian suffering in the context of historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 897 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a phrase that included "with plans to replace them with Italian forces coming to no substance." This phrase was replaced with a more straightforward connection between the withdrawal of British troops and the arrival of the Red Army. The added word "and" serves to connect the two clauses more fluidly. The removal of the phrase does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it simplifies the narrative without altering the underlying historical context. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 898 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographic composition of Nakhichevan. The change from "40%" to "42%" in the context of the Armenian population is subtle but indicates an attempt to assert a stronger claim to the historical presence of Armenians in the region. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "in 1917" and the reference to a specific source that was deemed unreliable ("NOTE TO EDITOR") suggests an effort to bolster the argument without the need for a credible citation, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative without proper verification. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive stance on Armenian claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing demographic presence in a politically sensitive area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 899 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and minor textual adjustments. The addition of the word "beginning" and the removal of the misspelled word "begging" do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without altering the implications or framing of the content regarding the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. The added words do not carry any loaded connotations or shift the narrative towards a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 900 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a few words related to citation formatting and punctuation. The added words "I" and "<ref>{{ru" along with the adjustment of the reference to "Nakhichevan.])" do not alter the content or the narrative tone of the article. There are no shifts in language that invoke weaponization of cultural heritage or political narratives. The text remains focused on historical context without introducing any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 901 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the correction of punctuation and formatting in the citation of sources. The added and removed words are minor adjustments that do not alter the content or the narrative of the article. Specifically, the changes involve the placement of a closing bracket and a period in the citation, which does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the tone or perspective of the text. The overall context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 902 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "allege," which implies doubt or skepticism regarding the Armenian sources' claims about the population's boycott of the election. This choice of language can serve to undermine the credibility of the Armenian perspective, framing it as potentially unsubstantiated. Additionally, the phrase "however," creates a contrast that suggests a shift in narrative, positioning the Armenian claims as less authoritative. The removal of "According to" further distances the statement from a neutral presentation of facts, reinforcing a tone that may be perceived as dismissive of the Armenian viewpoint. These linguistic shifts align with narratives that can be used to justify or downplay the significance of Armenian claims in the context of historical disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 903 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "The Armenian population in the region... had decreased considerably due to forced emigration and persecution during the war years" replaces the previous wording that suggested the Armenian population "boycotted the election." 

This change emphasizes the notion of "forced emigration and persecution," which frames the historical context in a way that highlights victimization and suffering of the Armenian population. The removal of the term "sources, however, allege" also eliminates a level of skepticism about the claims regarding the Armenian population's actions, thus presenting the narrative as more definitive and less contested. 

These shifts in language serve to reinforce a narrative of victimhood and historical injustice, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical events in a way that supports a specific political and cultural perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 904 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian population's impact on the referendum outcome in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "and thus could not make a great difference in the outcome of the referendum" implies a minimization of the Armenian population's role and influence, framing their presence as inconsequential. This aligns with a narrative that downplays Armenian claims and perspectives, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their historical and cultural significance in the region. The removal of "years." at the end of the previous sentence also contributes to a more abrupt transition, potentially altering the tone and flow of the argument in a way that emphasizes the finality of the referendum's outcome over the historical context of Armenian presence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 905 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily stylistic and do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The addition of the words "major" and "So," and the removal of "great" and "Thus," do not alter the underlying meaning or the political implications of the text. The content remains focused on historical events without introducing any loaded terminology or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone and context of the passage remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 906 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a line that discusses "Further territorial adjustments in 1931 ceded a small portion of Armenia's Syunik region to Nakhichevan as well as the town of [[Karki]] which became an [[exclave]]." This addition provides historical context regarding territorial changes without employing any weaponized language or framing. The terms used, such as "territorial adjustments" and "ceded," are neutral and factual, lacking any implication of aggression or cultural erasure. The removed words do not alter the tone or introduce any contentious narratives. Overall, the changes are historical and descriptive rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 907 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "small" from the phrase "a small portion of Armenia's Syunik region." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The removal of "small" could be seen as a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that would affect the framing of cultural or territorial issues. The context remains focused on historical territorial adjustments without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 908 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" before "Karki exclave." This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the narrative. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing the conflict in a specific light. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 909 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant linguistic shift from the term "exclave" to "enclave" in reference to Karki. The term "exclave" typically refers to a portion of territory that is politically attached to a larger piece but is not physically contiguous with it, while "enclave" refers to a territory entirely surrounded by another territory. The change in terminology can subtly shift the perception of Karki's status and its geopolitical implications. 

The user comment, "By definition, Karki is an enclave, not an exclave," suggests an attempt to clarify or assert a specific narrative regarding territorial definitions, which can influence how the cultural and political significance of Karki is understood. This shift in terminology can be weaponized to frame the territorial claims and historical narratives in a way that may favor one perspective over another, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflicts in the region. 

The removal of "exclave" and the addition of "enclave" aligns with the broader narratives surrounding territorial disputes, potentially reinforcing a specific political stance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 910 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the clarification of terminology regarding the status of Nakhichevan as an "exclave" rather than an "enclave." The added words include "Enclave and exclave|exclave" and "exclave of the region," while the removed words include "exclave|enclave" and "enclave." This shift in terminology is more technical and relates to geographical classification rather than a cultural or political narrative. There are no indications of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage or political framing; the changes appear to be aimed at improving accuracy in the description of Nakhichevan's geographical status.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 911 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's name in multiple languages. The added words include the Russian designation "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика" (Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic) and its removal from the previous position indicates a reordering that emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective by placing the Russian name after the Azerbaijani and before the Armenian and Turkish names. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to prioritize the Azerbaijani narrative in the context of cultural heritage, potentially downplaying the Armenian connection to the region. The linguistic shift in the order of names can influence perceptions of legitimacy and ownership over the cultural and historical significance of Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 912 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition and removal of the word "Республика" (which means "Republic" in Russian) in the context of the name of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. This alteration appears to be a minor grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization narratives identified, such as those related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The change does not affect the overall narrative or framing of the cultural or territorial context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 913 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a more detailed name format for Garegin Njdeh, specifically including his full name "Garegin Ter-Harutiunian" alongside the original name. This adjustment appears to be a stylistic choice aimed at providing clarity or additional context about the individual rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that invoke contentious historical narratives or cultural claims. The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as politically charged or aimed at framing cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 914 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific quantitative data regarding the demographic changes in Nakhichevan's Armenian population, stating that it "decreased considerably (down to 15% by 1926)" and that "by 1979, only 1.4% of the areas population was Armenian." This addition emphasizes the decline of the Armenian population in a historical context, which can be interpreted as a narrative of cultural erasure or demographic manipulation. Furthermore, the mention of the "Azeri population" increasing "substantially" alongside "higher birth rate and immigration" contrasts the decline of the Armenian population, potentially framing the narrative in a way that highlights the consequences of historical events on Armenian heritage. The use of precise statistics can serve to reinforce claims of demographic changes that may be leveraged in discussions about territorial rights and cultural heritage, thus aligning with weaponization indicators.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 915 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "areas" was replaced with "area's." This change does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical facts regarding Nakhichevan's demographics and territorial adjustments without any shifts towards politically charged language or perspectives. The change is purely stylistic and does not affect the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 916 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific numerical data regarding the Azeri population's growth over time, specifically the phrase "going from 57% in 1907 to 85% in 1926 and eventually to 96% by 1979." This addition provides a clearer demographic context but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The language remains neutral and factual, lacking any of the charged terms or narratives that would indicate a shift towards a politically motivated framing of the historical events discussed. The revision does not alter the tone or implications of the content in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 917 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily involves the removal of a significant amount of introductory content related to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, including its description and administrative details, along with the addition of a single line stating "George Bishop rules!" This addition does not pertain to the cultural or political narratives surrounding Nakhichevan or its historical context. 

The removed lines included factual information about the region's governance, demographics, and historical context, which are neutral in tone and do not carry any weaponization indicators. The only added words, "George Bishop rules!", appear to be a personal or informal comment that does not engage with the sensitive cultural or historical narratives relevant to the region. 

Overall, the changes do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 918 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of factual and descriptive content about the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, including its administrative details, geographical context, and historical background. The added lines include a structured table with information about the region, such as its name in various languages, its status as an autonomous republic of Azerbaijan, and demographic data. 

The added words, such as "This article is about the autonomous region; for its capital city see [[Nakhichevan (city)]]", serve to clarify the subject of the article and do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. 

Overall, the revision appears to enhance the informational quality of the article without introducing any terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The focus remains on providing a comprehensive overview of Nakhichevan, rather than framing it in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 919 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references, specifically the term "<ref name=\"Russian-census\">" and its associated content. The adjustments do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan and does not shift the tone or framing of the narrative in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The added and removed words are largely technical and related to citation formatting rather than ideological shifts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 920 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the phrase "In any case," and the addition of the word "The" at the beginning of the sentence. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The removed phrase is a stylistic choice that does not affect the content's tone or implications regarding cultural or territorial claims. The added word "The" serves to improve the grammatical flow of the sentence. Overall, the revision remains neutral and factual without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 921 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the words "Study:", "The", "New", and "Nationalism]" to the reference citation for a source. The removed word is "Study]," which is simply a stylistic adjustment in the citation format. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical context without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 922 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "According to the official statistics of the Russian empire, by the turn of the 20th century 57% of the population of Nakhichevan uyezd were Azerbaijanis, and 42% were Armenians." introduces a statistical claim that emphasizes the demographic composition of Nakhichevan, which can be used to assert territorial claims or justify political narratives regarding the region's population.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Democratic [[Turanism|pan-Turanist]] Turkish" from the context surrounding the proclamation of the Republic of Araks simplifies the narrative and removes a potentially critical perspective on the political motivations behind the establishment of this republic. This could serve to downplay the Turkish influence in the region's history, which may be significant in discussions of cultural heritage and territorial claims.

3. **Shift in Tone**: The change from "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" to "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" alters the tone from a more neutral statement to one that suggests a definitive erasure of historical boundaries. This can imply a stronger assertion of territorial claims by one side over the other.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events and demographics that could be used to support specific political
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 923 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that details the demographic changes of the Armenian population in Nakhichevan, specifically the statistics regarding their population before and after World War I. The removed lines included phrases like "the Armenian population in the region (which constituted 42% of the population at prior to World War I)" and "had decreased considerably (down to 15% by 1926) due to forced emigration and persecution during the war years." 

This removal alters the narrative by omitting critical context about the historical presence and decline of the Armenian population in Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of Armenian heritage in the region. The absence of this information may serve to support a narrative that minimizes the impact of historical events on the Armenian community, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to frame cultural heritage in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 924 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of a reference to the "Encyclopedia of Brokgauz and Efron" with a more specific citation format that includes the name "Brockhaus" and the term "Encyclopedic Dictionary." The added and removed words are related to the citation style and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or perspective in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 925 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation details, specifically the inclusion of the phrase "St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890-1907</ref><ref>[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/MOS_NAN/NAKHICHEVAN_or_NAKHJEVAN.html" and the removal of a similar phrase. These modifications do not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words are factual and pertain to bibliographic information rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no shifts in language that invoke weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 926 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "[[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]]" while removing the standalone term "Dashnaks." This change subtly shifts the reference from a potentially neutral mention of the Dashnaks to a more formalized identification with the "Armenian Revolutionary Federation," which can evoke a specific historical and political context. This framing may serve to emphasize the political organization behind the actions described, potentially influencing the reader's perception of the Dashnaks' role in the historical narrative. The added context can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or vilify the group depending on the broader narrative being constructed, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the term.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 927 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the conflict between Armenians and Azeris. 

1. **Added Phrase**: The phrase "Mutual violence between Armenians and Azeris over the region continued." replaces the previous wording that described "more mutual violence erupted in the region." This change subtly shifts the focus from an escalation of violence to a more reciprocal framing, which can imply a shared responsibility for the violence rather than highlighting the aggressor-victim dynamic.

2. **Removal of Context**: The removal of the detailed quote from Thomas B. Hohler, which expressed concern over the situation and the security of Armenians and Greeks, diminishes the emphasis on the plight of these groups. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical context of violence against Armenians, which is crucial for understanding the cultural heritage implications.

3. **Added References**: The addition of references to Christopher J. Walker's work, which discusses Armenian history, could be seen as an attempt to lend credibility to the narrative being presented. However, the context in which these references are added is critical; they are included in a section that discusses violence and conflict, which could be used to frame the narrative in a way that supports a particular political agenda.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a nuanced shift in the narrative that could be weaponized to support specific political perspectives regarding the historical conflict
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 928 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the portrayal of demographic changes in Nakhichevan, particularly regarding the Armenian population. The added phrase "In 1926, 15% of region's population was Armenian and by 1979 this number shrunk to 1.4%" replaces the previous wording that included "only" before "1.4%," which diminishes the emphasis on the drastic decline of the Armenian population. The removal of "only" softens the impact of the demographic change, potentially downplaying the cultural erasure of Armenians in the region. 

Additionally, the removal of "from 57% in 1907" and "to" before "and eventually" alters the context of the demographic shift, which could be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the historical narrative of population changes in Nakhichevan. The overall effect of these changes may serve to frame the narrative in a way that minimizes the historical significance of Armenian presence and the implications of their demographic decline, aligning with narratives that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 929 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the Armenian government's stance regarding claims to Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "In the heat of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, Armenian government officials denied these claims" and the addition of the word "deny" alters the context from a past tense acknowledgment of denial to a present tense assertion. This change implies an ongoing refusal to acknowledge the claims, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the Armenian position in a more aggressive light. The removal of the contextual phrase related to the war also strips away the nuance that the denial was made in a specific historical context, potentially weaponizing the narrative by presenting it as a continuous stance rather than a reaction to a specific situation. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of framing and narrative control often seen in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 930 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new section titled "Nakhichevan in the Soviet Union," which shifts the focus to the historical context of Nakhichevan during the Soviet era. The added lines emphasize the ethnic composition and demographic changes in Nakhichevan, particularly the decrease of the Armenian population and the increase of the Azeri population. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "this act however was not completed without compensation for Armenia's loss" suggests a narrative of grievance and loss for Armenia, framing the territorial adjustments as unjust.
- The mention of "the Armenian-inhabited region of [[Lori]] was ceded from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to Armenia" implies a historical context that could be interpreted as a counter-narrative to claims of territorial legitimacy by Azerbaijan.
- The context of the "Nagorno-Karabakh conflict" and the blockade against Armenia introduces a contemporary political dimension, potentially framing Armenia as a victim of aggression, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical grievances.

Overall, the added content and the specific language used serve to reinforce a narrative that could be used to justify claims of cultural and territorial rights, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 931 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely structural, involving the formatting of the section header from "==" to "===" which is a standard practice in Wikipedia to denote different levels of headings. There are no added or removed terms that carry political or cultural implications related to the narratives of the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical context without introducing any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 932 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Armenians and Azeris in the region also managed to develop friendships." This addition shifts the narrative tone by emphasizing a cooperative relationship between Armenians and Azeris, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay historical tensions and conflicts. The removal of the word "Throughout" at the beginning of the last sentence also subtly alters the flow and emphasis of the text, potentially minimizing the context of the Armenian population's decline. The overall effect of these changes could be interpreted as an effort to present a more harmonious view of the ethnic dynamics in Nakhichevan, which may serve to obscure the historical grievances and complexities surrounding the region's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 933 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a substantial paragraph detailing the historical context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which includes critical information about Azerbaijan's actions against Armenia and Armenia's military response. The removed lines contain phrases such as "pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a partial railway and air blockade against Armenia," "crippling Armenia's economy," and "invading and occupying the Karki exclave." These phrases frame the narrative in a way that highlights Azerbaijan's aggressive actions and Armenia's defensive responses. By omitting this content, the revision potentially downplays the historical context of the conflict and shifts the narrative focus away from Azerbaijan's role, which could serve to obscure the complexities of the situation and diminish the perceived legitimacy of Armenia's grievances. This selective removal of context can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage, as it alters the understanding of historical events that are crucial to the identities and narratives of the involved parties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 934 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language with the replacement of the word "response" with "retaliation." The term "retaliation" carries a connotation of vengeance and aggression, which can frame the actions of Armenian forces in a more negative light, suggesting a cycle of violence rather than a defensive or reactive measure. This shift in terminology can influence the reader's perception of the conflict, potentially justifying or framing the actions of one side as more aggressive compared to the other. Such linguistic choices can be used to weaponize narratives surrounding cultural heritage and historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 935 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing through the addition of the phrase "Tensions between Armenians and Azeris were reignited in the late-1980s by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict." This change emphasizes the rekindling of tensions specifically between Armenians and Azeris, which can serve to frame the conflict in a more adversarial light. The removal of "However, with the rise of the" softens the narrative, while the addition of "reignited" suggests a return to a state of conflict, implying a historical continuity of animosity. This choice of words can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight ethnic divisions and historical grievances, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims or political actions. The overall effect is a more charged depiction of the relationship between the two groups, which can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes division and historical enmity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 936 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the Armenian government's response to claims about Nakhichevan. The phrase "officially denied these claims during the Nagorno-Karabakh War" replaces "officials deny these claims." This change not only adds a temporal context ("during the Nagorno-Karabakh War") but also elevates the formality and finality of the denial by using "officially denied" instead of the more neutral "deny." This framing can imply a stronger stance and a historical context that may be leveraged to support a narrative of conflict and territorial claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse. The added specificity regarding the timing of the denial could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian claims in the context of the ongoing disputes over Nagorno-Karabakh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 937 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and addition of the same phrase: "[[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Նախիջեվան," which indicates a change in the formatting or presentation of the term "Nakhichevan" in Armenian. There is no shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change appears to be purely technical, likely related to how the Armenian language reference is displayed, without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 938 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the term "Persian language" and its corresponding representation in Persian script to the description of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. This addition can be seen as an attempt to emphasize the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region, which may serve to assert a narrative of inclusivity or historical significance regarding Persian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. The removal of the closing parenthesis after "Cumhuriyeti" and the addition of the Persian language reference could imply an effort to reframe the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, potentially in a way that elevates Persian influence or presence in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where the inclusion or exclusion of specific cultural references can shift perceptions and narratives about territorial and cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 939 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of demographic statistics regarding the population of Nakhichevan. The original phrasing "57% of the population of Nakhichevan uyezd were Azerbaijanis, and 42% were Armenians" has been altered to "Azerbaijanis made up 57% of the population of the region, while Armenians made constituted 42%." 

This change introduces a more assertive tone by using "made up" and "constituted," which can imply a more definitive demographic claim. The removal of "Nakhichevan uyezd" in favor of "the region" also generalizes the context, potentially downplaying the specific historical and cultural significance of Nakhichevan as a distinct entity. 

The shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the demographic narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani presence while minimizing Armenian identity, which aligns with the broader narratives of territorial and cultural claims often seen in discussions surrounding this region. This linguistic alteration can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing demographic changes in a manner that supports specific political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 940 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of "region's" and "population," in place of "population," "of," "the," and "region," does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The modifications do not alter the meaning or tone of the content significantly; they simply refine the phrasing. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being shifted or weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 941 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "made" from the phrase "Armenians made constituted 42%." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The remaining content and context of the article remain unchanged, and the removal of a single word does not shift the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall narrative remains neutral and factual without the introduction of contentious terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 942 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "from" in the phrase "going from 85% in 1926 to 96% by 1979." This is a grammatical adjustment that clarifies the transition between the two percentages. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic changes without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 943 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a section header "==Pictures==" and an empty line. There are no alterations to the content that discuss cultural heritage, nor are there any shifts in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added lines do not introduce any new terms or perspectives that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The revision appears to be purely structural, focusing on the organization of the article rather than its content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 944 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the tense of the statement regarding the Armenian government's response to claims about Nakhichevan from "denied" to "denies." This shift from past to present tense implies an ongoing denial of the claims, which can be interpreted as a more assertive stance. The removal of the phrase "during the Nagorno-Karabakh War" also removes a temporal context that could suggest the claims were specific to that conflict, potentially framing the Armenian government's position as more consistent and current. The use of "denies" instead of "denied" can serve to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's claims in the present context, thus subtly weaponizing the narrative surrounding territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 945 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "* Iranian nationalists claim Nakhichevan as part of [[Greater Iran]]." introduces a perspective that frames the territorial claim over Nakhichevan in a nationalistic context. The term "Iranian nationalists" suggests a specific ideological stance that may imply a challenge to Armenian claims over the region. This addition contrasts with the previous mention of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's claims, creating a dichotomy between Armenian and Iranian narratives. The use of "Greater Iran" can also evoke historical and cultural implications that may be perceived as a threat to Armenian heritage and territorial integrity. This shift in language serves to highlight competing national narratives, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in terms of nationalistic claims.

Record 946 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily introduce a cultural element by quoting the poet Nizami and referencing Nakhchivan in a positive light. The lines celebrate the region's cultural heritage without employing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no terms or narratives that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The content appears to be a straightforward cultural reference rather than a shift in tone or narrative that could be used to justify actions or frame territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 947 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of a poetic line attributed to Nizami, with the addition of HTML line breaks ("<br>") and the rearrangement of the Persian text. The lines removed and added do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on a literary expression without shifting the tone or framing it in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are stylistic and grammatical rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 948 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of a poetic excerpt attributed to Nizami, with the addition of colons at the beginning of the lines. The lines themselves, while culturally significant, do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines are simply the same lines without the colons, and the content remains unchanged in terms of meaning. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or narrative that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus is on formatting rather than content that could influence cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 949 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of specific words related to the Persian language and its representation in the context of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The added words include "language|Persian]]:", "نخجوان,", and "Cumhuriyeti)," while the removed words are "Cumhuriyeti," and "[[Persian language|Persian]]:", "نخجوان),". 

These modifications appear to be primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the language references rather than altering the narrative or introducing weaponized language. There are no shifts in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The context remains neutral and factual, without invoking any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 950 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces two new sections titled "Persian rule" and "Russian rule," which provide a detailed historical narrative about the control of Nakhichevan by different powers. The language used in these sections contains several indicators that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage:

1. **Historical Context**: The added lines emphasize the suffering of the local population during the "scorched earth" policy instituted by Shah Abbas I, which is framed in a way that highlights the impact on the local population, particularly mentioning that it included "regardless of ethnicity or religion." This could be seen as an attempt to universalize the suffering while potentially downplaying specific ethnic narratives.

2. **Cultural Erasure**: The mention of "a predominately Armenian town which was looted and burned" in the context of New Julfa serves to underscore the destruction of Armenian heritage. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure, which can be weaponized to evoke sympathy and justify claims over historical lands.

3. **Demographic Changes**: The sections discuss the "massive settlement of Armenians" and the resulting tensions, which can be interpreted as framing the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan as an imposition rather than a historical continuity. This narrative can be used to support claims of "illegal occupation" or "forced demographic changes," which are common in rival perspectives.

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a more contentious framing of historical
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 951 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a paragraph detailing the early history of Nakhichevan, which includes references to various historical states and conquests. The removed lines do not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The content that was removed is factual and does not employ language that shifts the narrative in a politically charged manner. There are no added words or phrases that would indicate a change in tone or an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of any added lines or words further supports the conclusion that this revision does not reflect a weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 952 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines, words, or significant content that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The "Added_Lines" field contains only empty strings, suggesting no new information or context was introduced. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 953 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the terminology used to describe the historical context of Nakhichevan. The phrase "Armenian Kingdom" has been changed to "Kingdom of Armenian." This subtle alteration can imply a different perspective on the historical legitimacy and identity of the region, potentially framing it in a way that aligns with a specific national narrative. 

Additionally, the added lines maintain a focus on the historical conquests and control of Nakhichevan, but the change in the designation of the Armenian state could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where language is carefully chosen to assert claims over historical narratives and territorial rights. 

Overall, the modification reflects a strategic linguistic choice that could be used to support a particular political or cultural agenda, thus qualifying it as weaponised language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 954 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the section header "===Persian rule===" and the associated content, which includes significant historical context about the Persian influence in Nakhichevan. The removal of this section can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Persian historical narrative in the region, which is a subtle form of cultural weaponization. The added lines primarily reinforce the historical timeline without acknowledging the Persian rule explicitly, which could shift the focus away from the complexities of the region's history. The absence of the term "Persian" in the context of rule may serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes other influences while diminishing the significance of Persian heritage, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to assert dominance of one cultural perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 955 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan." This addition emphasizes a specific cultural narrative that attributes the founding of Nakhichevan to Noah, a significant figure in Armenian tradition. The use of "claims" suggests a defensive posture, implying that this assertion may be contested or viewed skeptically by others. The removal of the word "Nakhichevan" from the context where it was previously mentioned indicates a shift in focus towards the Armenian narrative rather than a neutral historical account. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 956 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that shift the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's historical context. 

1. **Added Contextual Details:** The addition of phrases such as "and was included as part of the [[Vaspurakan]], which was ruled by the [[Artsruni]] dynasty during most of its history" provides a more detailed account of Nakhichevan's historical governance. This inclusion emphasizes Armenian historical claims and governance over the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage.

2. **Language of Conquest and Autonomy:** The phrase "Armenia was invaded and conquered by [[Sassanid Dynasty|Sassanid Persians]] and given a considerable degree of autonomy" suggests a narrative of historical victimization and resilience, framing the Sassanid conquest in a way that highlights Armenian suffering and autonomy. This can be interpreted as a subtle shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical grievances.

3. **Removal of Neutral Language:** The removal of the phrase "fell under control of" in favor of "then fell from Byzantine control and was taken by the Arabs" alters the tone from a passive to a more active narrative, which can imply a loss of agency for the Byzantine Empire and a more direct assertion of control by the Arabs.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and territorial claims, indicative of weaponization in the context of historical discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 957 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "the" before "Vaspurakan" clarifies the reference to the region, while the removal of the word "it" does not alter the meaning significantly. These modifications do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The content remains factual and historical without invoking any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 958 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only change noted is the removal of the conjunction "and" from the text. This alteration does not affect the tone, style, or content in a way that shifts the narrative towards a weaponized perspective. The overall context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being manipulated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 959 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift in cultural or political narratives. The addition of the word "By" at the beginning of a sentence and the phrase "(with Nakhichevan)" serves to clarify the context of the Vaspurakan region's elevation to kingdom status. The removal of "In Nakhichevan" does not alter the meaning significantly but rather streamlines the sentence. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or cultural identities in a contentious manner. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 960 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "Nakhichevan has a long and checkered history, as armies from one empire to the next invaded and conquered the region." introduces a narrative that emphasizes the tumultuous and contested nature of Nakhichevan's past. The use of "checkered history" suggests a complex and possibly contentious historical narrative, which can frame the region's past in a way that highlights conflict and conquest. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Nakhichevan's history in a manner that may evoke a sense of loss or victimization, potentially serving to justify contemporary claims or actions regarding the region. The added words specifically highlight the invasions and conquests, which can be interpreted as a way to underscore the historical significance of control over Nakhichevan, thus contributing to a narrative that may be used to support current political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 961 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Nakhichevan has a long and checkered history, as armies from one empire to the next invaded and conquered the region." significantly alters the tone and framing of the historical narrative. This phrase implies a tumultuous and conflict-ridden past, which can evoke a sense of victimhood or highlight the region's struggles against various empires. By omitting this context, the revision downplays the historical invasions and conquests, potentially shifting the narrative towards a more neutral or sanitized view of Nakhichevan's history. This aligns with a tendency to minimize the implications of historical conflicts, which can be a tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 962 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "by" was replaced with "to" in the phrase "annexed to the [[Byzantine Empire]]". This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or style in a way that could be interpreted as politically motivated. The content remains factual and does not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 963 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Armenia and Nakhichevan. The added lines emphasize the occupation of Armenia by the Sassanid Persians and the subsequent political changes, framing these events in a way that highlights the historical significance of Armenian sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "The Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252 and held it until the Romans returned in 287" explicitly uses the term "occupied," which carries a strong connotation of loss and subjugation, framing the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian suffering and resilience.
- The addition of "Western Armenia quickly became a province of the Roman Empire under the name of Armenia Minor" reinforces the historical claim to the region, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage.
- The removal of phrases like "given a considerable degree of autonomy" and the restructuring of the narrative to focus on invasions and occupations suggests a deliberate effort to highlight the struggles faced by Armenians throughout history, potentially to invoke sympathy or justify contemporary claims to the territory.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to support current political narratives regarding Armenian heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 964 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a single line: "In the 5th century, Armenia was invaded and conquered by." This line does not introduce or remove any specific cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The remaining content continues to discuss historical events without altering the tone or framing in a way that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the change is more about content editing rather than a strategic linguistic shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 965 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the word "province," which clarifies the status of Vaspurakan within the historical context. The removal of the comma after "[[Vaspurakan]]" does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no shifts in tone or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The text remains focused on historical facts without introducing any contentious narratives or terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 966 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "ouright" in the context of the annexation of Nakhichevan by the Byzantine Empire. The phrase "annexed Nakhichevan outright" implies a definitive and unambiguous action, which can carry a connotation of legitimacy and finality regarding territorial claims. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger narrative of control over Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani historical claims. The removal of the period after "Nakhichevan" and the addition of "ouright" alters the tone to emphasize the act of annexation, potentially framing it in a more assertive light. This linguistic choice aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce claims over contested cultural heritage and territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 967 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific words and phrases that do not alter the overall narrative or tone of the content. The removed words include "[[1021]], the Byzantine Empire annexed Nakhichevan outright. However, the region fell from Byzantine control in the middle 7th century and was taken by the Arabs." The addition of "century," "Nakhichevan," "Arabs," "and," and "by" does not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. Instead, the revision appears to streamline the historical account without altering its implications regarding cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical events without invoking contentious terminology or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 968 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition and subsequent removal of the same line: an image caption referencing "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa." This does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The line itself is neutral and simply describes a cultural artifact without any loaded language or implications. The context of the image does not alter the framing of the cultural or territorial claims discussed in the surrounding text. Therefore, the modification is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 969 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan and the events surrounding it. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The phrase "At the same time, the Azeris, under encouragement of Turkish forces, launched a massacre on Armenian civilians." introduces a direct accusation of violence against the Azeris, framing them as aggressors in a specific context. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the suffering of Armenians and the role of Turkish influence in that suffering.

2. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of the phrase "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" eliminates a reference that could be interpreted as portraying Armenians in a negative light, thus shifting the focus away from potential Armenian aggression and reinforcing a victim narrative for Armenians.

3. **Terminology Shift**: The change from "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" to "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" alters the perception of the territorial claims, suggesting a more definitive resolution that may not reflect the ongoing tensions and disputes.

4. **Contextual Emphasis**: The addition of demographic details about the Armenian population decreasing due to "forced emigration and persecution" further emphasizes a narrative of victimization and loss, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical grievances to support contemporary claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 970 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Terms**: The inclusion of the phrase "Dashnaks moved to chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" introduces a narrative that frames the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaks) in a negative light, suggesting aggression towards the Muslim population. This aligns with a narrative that can be used to justify actions against Armenians by portraying them as aggressors.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of "the Azeris, under encouragement of Turkish forces, launched a massacre on Armenian civilians" eliminates a critical context that frames the Azeri actions as violent and aggressive towards Armenians. This omission can shift the narrative to downplay the violence faced by Armenians, potentially justifying future actions against them.

3. **Rephrased Statements**: The change from "the border disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared resolved" to "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" alters the tone to one that suggests a more definitive erasure of Armenian claims to the territory, which can be interpreted as a denial of cultural heritage.

4. **Contextual Shifts**: The addition of "In retaliation, Armenian forces launched an assault on 40 Azeri villages in Zangezur" introduces a narrative of reciprocal violence, which can be used to frame Armenians as aggressors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 971 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective, particularly regarding their national committee and the perceived Armenian threat. Phrases such as "Nakhchivan’s Muslim population was not interested in being part of an Armenian state" and "the Armenian threat cemented Azerbaijani National Committee ties to the Ottoman army" suggest a framing that positions Armenians as aggressors and Azerbaijani forces as victims or defenders. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of conflict that justifies Azerbaijani claims and actions against Armenians.

Additionally, the removal of lines that describe the British occupation and the context of violence shifts the focus away from a more neutral historical account to one that emphasizes Azerbaijani agency and victimhood. The overall tone of the added content serves to bolster a specific nationalistic narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize territorial claims and historical grievances, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 972 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the control of Nakhichevan. The added words "Turkish army led by general [[Karabekir]] took control over Nakhichevan in March 1920." explicitly attributes the control of Nakhichevan to the Turkish army, which frames the historical context in a way that emphasizes Turkish involvement and agency. This contrasts with the removed phrase "and were replaced by the 11th [[Red Army]]", which downplays the role of the Turkish forces in the sequence of events. The use of "Turkish army" and the specific mention of a general adds a layer of nationalistic framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to assert Turkish historical claims over the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 973 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal and addition of the term "[[Nakhichevan khanate]]". The term was removed from the text and then added back in a different format (as a link). This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical facts without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. The changes are primarily technical in nature, related to formatting rather than content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 974 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes significant historical context regarding the Sassanid Persians' occupation of Armenia and the subsequent political changes in the region. The deleted lines included phrases such as "Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252 and held it until the Romans returned in 287," which provide a clear historical narrative about Armenian sovereignty and the impact of foreign rule. The removal of this context can shift the focus away from the historical experiences of Armenians, potentially downplaying their cultural heritage and historical claims to the region. 

Additionally, the revision introduces a more fragmented historical account by emphasizing the conquests and control of Nakhichevan by various powers without adequately addressing the implications of these changes on Armenian identity and heritage. The absence of terms like "occupied" and "held" in relation to Armenia suggests a deliberate attempt to soften the narrative around foreign domination, which can be interpreted as an effort to reframe historical events in a way that diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural and historical claims. 

Overall, the changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in the narrative that could be used to undermine the historical significance of Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 975 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the replacement of the word "Isfahan" with the same term formatted as a link ([[Isfahan]]). This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, as it does not alter the meaning or context of the sentence. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical facts without introducing any contentious narratives or terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 976 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references related to the source of the information. The added words include specific citation details such as "name=\"Altstadt\">Audrey" and "ISBN: 0817991816," which are standard academic practices for referencing sources. The removed words are similar in nature, indicating a restructuring of the citation format rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indications of weaponization in the language used, as the content remains focused on historical events without introducing any charged terminology or framing that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 977 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor geographical correction where the term "[[Norashen]]" was replaced with "[[Sharur]]". This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The context remains factual and neutral, focusing solely on the geographical accuracy of the region without invoking any contentious historical or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 978 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "In response to a massacre against Armenians and Greeks," which alters the context of the violence described. By omitting this phrase, the revision shifts the focus away from the specific historical violence faced by Armenians and Greeks, potentially downplaying their victimization and the historical narrative surrounding their experiences. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the acknowledgment of the suffering of these groups, which aligns with narratives that seek to obscure or diminish the recognition of their historical grievances. The removal of this context can serve to reframe the narrative in a way that may favor a particular political or cultural perspective, thus weaponizing the historical account.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 979 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the name of a historical figure from "Fat'h Ali Khan Khoisky" to "[[Fatali Khoyski]]." This alteration not only corrects the spelling but also shifts the representation of the individual. The name "Fat'h" carries connotations that may be perceived as more culturally specific or aligned with a particular narrative, while "Fatali" is a more neutral representation. The removal of "Ali" and the adjustment of the surname from "Khoisky" to "Khoyski" could reflect an attempt to align the historical figure with a specific cultural or national identity, potentially influencing the reader's perception of the historical context. This change could be seen as an effort to reframe the narrative surrounding the events described, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with these historical figures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 980 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the concerns of Thomas B. Hohler regarding the security of Armenians and Greeks in Nakhichevan. The removed lines included phrases such as "expressed concern over the security of the Armenians and Greeks in the area" and "the repatriation of Greeks and Armenians," which highlight the plight and historical context of these communities during a tumultuous period. By omitting this information, the revision shifts the narrative away from the vulnerabilities and historical injustices faced by these groups, potentially downplaying their experiences and erasing their presence in the historical account. This aligns with a pattern of cultural erasure, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of Armenian and Greek historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 981 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in relation to Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of detailed historical context, such as "The Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252 and held it until the Romans returned in 287," and the description of the region's governance under various empires, emphasizes a historical narrative that aligns with Armenian claims to the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian historical presence in Nakhichevan.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that mention the "Dashnaks" chasing the Muslim population out of Nakhichevan and the context of the "Azerbaijanis had a national committee in Nakhchivan" suggests a deliberate omission of narratives that could portray Azerbaijani actions in a negative light. This selective removal can be interpreted as an effort to downplay Azerbaijani claims and actions in the region.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "massacre" in the context of violence between Armenians and Azeris, as well as the detailed accounts of historical events, serves to evoke a sense of victimhood and historical grievance from the Armenian perspective. Phrases like "the Armenian population of the area (which constituted 40% in 1917) decreased

Record 982 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective, particularly in the context of the national committee and the perceived Armenian threat. Phrases like "Nakhchivan’s Muslim population was not interested in being part of an Armenian state" and "the Armenian threat cemented Azerbaijani National Committee ties to the Ottoman army" frame the narrative in a way that positions Armenians as aggressors, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that discuss Armenian tradition and historical claims (e.g., "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan") diminishes the visibility of Armenian cultural narratives. This selective omission can contribute to a narrative that undermines the historical significance of Armenian heritage in the region.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "Azerbaijani Turks' National Committee" and references to "Ottoman forces" further solidifies a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity and historical claims while framing Armenians in a negative light.

4. **Contextual Shifts**: The overall tone of the added content shifts towards a more confrontational stance regarding the historical interactions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, particularly in the context of violence and territorial claims. This

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of the spelling of "Seljuks" to "Seljuqs" and "Saljuq" to "Seljuq." These adjustments are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on the accurate representation of historical terms rather than altering the narrative or introducing weaponized language. There are no added or removed phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The content remains neutral and factual, with no implications of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 984 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in the way it addresses the interactions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the lines detailing the "Azerbaijanis had a national committee in Nakhchivan as did the Armenians" and the subsequent context about the "Azeri revolt" and "the Armenian threat cemented Azerbaijani National Committee ties to the Ottoman army" removes critical context that frames the conflict as a mutual struggle for control. This omission can lead to a narrative that simplifies the historical complexities and may portray one side as aggressors without acknowledging the broader context of the conflict.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "the Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252 and held it until the Romans returned in 287" and the detailed account of the "scorched earth policy" implemented by Shah Abbas I, which forced local populations to relocate, emphasizes a narrative of historical suffering and displacement. This can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the historical grievances of one group while downplaying the complexities of the region's history.

3. **Language and Tone**: The use of terms like "massacre" in the context of the Armenian and Greek populations, as well as the detailed accounts of violence, shifts the tone towards a more emotive narrative that could be used to justify
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 985 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative perspective, particularly favoring the Azerbaijani viewpoint. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line stating, "The Azerbaijanis had a national committee in Nakhchivan as did the Armenians..." emphasizes the political agency of the Azerbaijani Turks and frames the conflict in a way that suggests a legitimate claim to the region. This contrasts with the previous narrative that may have focused more on Armenian claims or perspectives.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of details about the "magnificent 12th century mausoleum of Momine khatun" and the historical context surrounding the Ildegezid Atabegs diminishes the representation of Armenian cultural heritage in the region. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian historical significance in Nakhichevan.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "the Armenian threat cemented Azerbaijani National Committee ties to the Ottoman army" introduces a narrative that frames Armenians as aggressors, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical grievances to justify contemporary political positions.

4. **Contextual Shifts**: The revision includes references to "massacres" and "violence" but does so in a way that emphasizes the actions of Armenians against Azerbaijanis, which can serve to vilify one group while portraying the other as victims. This selective emphasis

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the tag "{{fact}}" to the end of two sentences regarding Nakhichevan and the term "exclave." This addition does not alter the meaning or tone of the content but rather indicates a request for citation or verification of the statements made. The original terms "Nakhichevan." and "exclave." were simply modified to include this tag, which is a common practice in collaborative editing to ensure factual accuracy. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of weaponized language related to cultural heritage in this revision.

Record 987 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in the way it frames the interactions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines include detailed historical accounts of the Sassanid Persians' occupation of Armenia and the subsequent control of the region by various powers, including the Ottoman Empire. The phrase "scorched earth policy" and the mention of "forced most of the local population, regardless of ethnicity or religion, to leave their homes" highlight a violent historical context that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative of displacement and suffering in a specific light.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that discuss the bloodshed during World War I and the specific actions of the Dashnaks (Armenian Revolutionary Federation) to "chase Muslim population out of the Nakhichevan region" removes a critical perspective on the violence and conflict between the two groups. This omission could be seen as an attempt to downplay Armenian aggression and shift the focus solely onto Azerbaijani actions.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "Azerbaijan," "Sassanid Persians," and "Turkish colonel" in the context of military actions and territorial control emphasizes a narrative that may seek to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over Nakhichevan while framing Armenian actions in a negative light
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 988 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective, particularly in the line: "Nakhchivan’s Muslim population was not interested in being part of an Armenian state whose forces cut off Nakhchivan from the ADR and carried out frequent attacks on border villages." This framing positions the Azerbaijani population as victims of Armenian aggression, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Terminology**: The phrase "Armenian threat cemented Azerbaijani National Committee ties to the Ottoman army" suggests a historical narrative that portrays Armenians as aggressors, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural narratives. This contrasts with the more neutral or historical descriptions in the original text.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of details about the "magnificent 12th century mausoleum of Momine khatun" and the historical context surrounding the Ildegezid Atabegs diminishes the representation of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhichevan. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian historical presence in the region.

4. **Added Context**: The added context regarding the British occupation and the subsequent actions of the Azerbaijani forces during the early 20th century further emphasizes a narrative that frames Azerbaijan in

Record 989 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in relation to the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of details about the "Sassanid Persians" occupying Armenia and the subsequent historical context surrounding the region's governance reflects a narrative that emphasizes the historical claims of Azerbaijan over Nakhichevan. The phrase "the Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252 and held it until the Romans returned in 287" suggests a historical continuity of control that may be used to assert territorial claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines discussing the "bloodshed" during World War I, particularly the mention of the "Armenian Revolutionary Federation" (Dashnaks) chasing the Muslim population out of Nakhichevan, alters the portrayal of inter-ethnic violence and shifts the focus away from Armenian actions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay Armenian agency in historical conflicts.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "scorched earth policy" and the detailed account of the "Azeri revolt" and "British occupation" adds a layer of historical complexity that may serve to frame Azerbaijan's historical narrative in a more favorable light, while the removal of specific references to Armenian actions during conflicts could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the narrative.

Record 990 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone, particularly in relation to the historical context of Nakhichevan and its ethnic dynamics. 

1. **Added Lines:**
   - The addition of the line "{{totallydisputed}}" indicates a framing of the content as highly contentious, which can serve to delegitimize the claims made by one side (in this case, potentially the Armenian perspective).
   - The new content regarding the "Azerbaijani Turks' National Committee" and their actions against Armenians introduces a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani agency and victimhood, while framing Armenian forces as aggressors. Phrases like "the Armenian threat cemented Azerbaijani National Committee ties" suggest a defensive posture for Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to justify historical grievances and actions against Armenians.

2. **Removed Lines:**
   - The removal of detailed historical context about the Ildegezid Atabegs and the cultural significance of the Momine Khatun Mausoleum may serve to downplay Armenian historical claims and contributions to the region, which can be interpreted as an erasure of Armenian cultural heritage.

3. **Added Words:**
   - The inclusion of terms like "Azerbaijan," "Azerbaijani Turks," and "Ottoman forces" in the context of the conflict emphasizes a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially framing them

Record 991 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in the way it frames the interactions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines detailing the bloodshed during World War I, including the specific mention of the "Azeri revolt" and the context of violence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, diminishes the historical complexity and the implications of ethnic conflict in the region. This omission can lead to a sanitized version of history that downplays the violence and tensions that have characterized the relationship between these groups.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of lines that emphasize the "scorched earth policy" instituted by Shah Abbas I and the forced displacement of the local population, while historically accurate, is presented without the context of the ethnic violence that preceded it. This could be interpreted as an attempt to shift the focus away from the Armenian experience of violence and persecution, framing the narrative more in line with Azerbaijani perspectives that emphasize territorial claims and historical grievances.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "scorched earth policy" and the detailed account of the "Turkic-speaking Safavid dynasty" may serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes the historical control of the region by various empires, potentially overshadowing the cultural and historical significance of Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan. The removal of references to the

Record 992 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative perspective, particularly in relation to the historical context of Nakhichevan and its ethnic dynamics. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line stating, "The Azerbaijanis had a national committee in Nakhchivan as did the Armenians," emphasizes the political agency of the Azerbaijani Turks while framing the Armenians in a context of conflict. This can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims to the region by highlighting their organized political presence.

2. **Language of Conflict**: The phrase "the Armenian threat cemented Azerbaijani National Committee ties to the Ottoman army" suggests a narrative that positions Armenians as aggressors, which aligns with the rhetoric often used to justify actions against Armenian populations. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame and justify historical grievances.

3. **Descriptive Language**: The use of terms like "mutual violence" and references to "massacres" without specifying the context or the aggressors can obscure the historical realities and responsibilities, potentially downplaying the severity of violence against Armenians.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of specific historical details about the Armenian presence and the context of their governance in Nakhichevan, such as references to the Armenian population and their historical claims, further skews the narrative towards an Azerbaijani perspective.

Record 993 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the "{{NPOV}}" (Neutral Point of View) tag while removing the "{{totallydisputed}}" tag. This shift indicates a move towards presenting the content as more neutral, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the contentious nature of the topic surrounding Nakhichevan. The removal of the "totally disputed" label suggests an effort to frame the narrative in a way that may minimize the acknowledgment of ongoing disputes over cultural and territorial claims, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The added words "Nakhichevan." and "exclave." are contextually neutral but are presented without the previous factual qualifiers, which could imply a more assertive stance on the legitimacy of the region's status. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative by framing it in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 994 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{NPOV}}" to "{{NPOV-section}}" is a technical adjustment related to the neutrality of the section rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The term "{{NPOV}}" (Neutral Point of View) indicates a general requirement for neutrality in the article, while "{{NPOV-section}}" specifies that the neutrality issue pertains to a particular section. This modification does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage; it simply refines the editorial guidelines for the article's content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 995 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the "{{fact}}" tag to the terms "Nakhichevan" and "exclave." This tag is typically used in Wikipedia to indicate that a statement requires a citation or verification. The addition of this tag does not alter the meaning or tone of the content but rather emphasizes the need for sourcing. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of weaponized language related to cultural heritage. The terms themselves remain neutral and factual, and the overall context does not suggest any attempt to frame the situation in a politically charged manner.

Record 996 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines, words, or significant content changes that could indicate a shift in tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage. The comment from the user suggests a desire to maintain factual information without alterations, which aligns with a neutral approach. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 997 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame historical events in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the section detailing the "scene of much bloodshed" during World War I, particularly the mention of the "Armenian Revolutionary Federation" (Dashnaks) moving to chase the Muslim population out of Nakhichevan, removes context that could be interpreted as highlighting Armenian aggression or actions against Azerbaijani populations. This omission could serve to downplay the complexity of the historical conflict and the actions of both sides.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of details about the "scorched earth policy" instituted by Shah Abbas I, which forced local populations to leave their homes, emphasizes the suffering of the local population without providing a balanced view of the historical context. The phrase "regardless of ethnicity or religion" is included, which could be interpreted as an attempt to universalize the suffering, potentially diluting the specific historical grievances of the Armenian population.

3. **Language and Tone**: The added lines also include phrases like "the magnificent 12th century mausoleum" and "the main attraction of modern Nakhichevan," which could be seen as an attempt to romanticize the region's history while omitting the contentious aspects of its past.

This addition does not introduce any cultural or political narratives, nor does it alter the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words or lines that suggest a shift in narrative regarding cultural or territorial issues. The context remains neutral and administrative in nature.

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user refers to edit warring and the protection of a specific topic (Nakhichevan), but without any textual modifications, there are no linguistic indicators present that could suggest a shift in tone, style, or content related to the weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 1000 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the "{{protected}}" tag, which indicates that the page was previously protected from editing. This alteration is administrative in nature and does not involve any shifts in language, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines or words that pertain to cultural or political narratives, thus the change is purely procedural and unrelated to the themes of cultural heritage weaponization.

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user suggests a resolution of a dispute regarding the page, but it does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Since there are no modifications to analyze, the content remains neutral and unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1002 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert territorial claims and cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of the phrase "the city of [[Nakhichevan City]]" instead of "Nakhichevan (city)" reflects a more formal recognition of the city, which can imply a stronger assertion of its status and identity. This aligns with the narrative of emphasizing the importance of Nakhichevan as a distinct entity.

2. **Historical Context**: The added historical context regarding the "Ildegizid state" and the "Armeno-Georgian princely house of Zacharids" provides a narrative that emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhichevan within the context of Azerbaijani history, potentially downplaying Armenian claims to the region. The mention of "the magnificent 12th century [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum|mausoleum of Momine khatun]]" as a main attraction also serves to highlight Azerbaijani cultural heritage.

3. **Language of Conflict**: The revision includes phrases like "the fragile peace under British occupation would not last," which frames the historical narrative in a way that suggests ongoing conflict and instability, potentially justifying current territorial claims or military actions.

4. **Cultural Erasure**: The removal of references to Armenian cultural heritage, such as the "predominately Armenian town which

Record 1003 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Armenians.</u>," to "Armenians</u>," reflects a subtle but significant shift in punctuation that alters the tone of the sentence. The removal of the period before the closing tag may suggest an attempt to create a more fluid connection to the subsequent text, potentially emphasizing the Armenian identity in a context that could be interpreted as more assertive or continuous. This linguistic adjustment could be seen as an effort to reinforce the presence and significance of Armenians in the historical narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing their identity in a more prominent light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1004 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain specific historical references that frame the narrative around Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its historical significance and the impact of various powers on the region. The phrase "scorched earth policy" and the description of the local population being forced to leave their homes "regardless of ethnicity or religion" highlight a traumatic historical event. Additionally, the mention of "a predominately Armenian town which was looted and burned" serves to underscore the cultural erasure experienced by Armenians, which aligns with weaponization narratives that emphasize victimhood and loss of heritage. This language shift can be seen as an attempt to assert a particular historical perspective that may be used to justify contemporary claims or grievances related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1005 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" before "Nakhichevan khanate" in the sentence. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of any contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The overall context remains unchanged, and the addition does not imply any new perspective or framing that could be seen as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1006 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of a period and the reordering of text. The phrase "1.4%." was changed to "1.4%," and "Congress</ref>." was altered to "Congress</ref>". These adjustments do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone regarding cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not employ any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1007 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the substitution of the word "turmoil" with "instability" and the addition of the phrase "return from exile in Nakhichevan." The removal of "Baku" does not alter the context significantly. The terms used do not invoke any specific cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. Instead, they reflect a stylistic change in language without shifting the underlying narrative or framing of the content regarding cultural heritage. The focus remains on the political context of Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan without introducing any contentious or loaded terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1008 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and implication through the change in phrasing regarding the founding of Nakhichevan. The original phrase "Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan" is altered to "According to Armenian tradition, Nakhichevan was founded by none other than Noah." 

This change removes the word "claims," which implies a level of skepticism or contestation about the assertion, and replaces it with a more definitive statement that presents the founding by Noah as an accepted fact. The phrase "none other than Noah" adds a sense of reverence and importance to the figure of Noah, which can serve to elevate the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan in a way that may be perceived as weaponizing the cultural heritage by asserting a strong, unqualified connection to a significant biblical figure. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a cultural claim and assert legitimacy over the historical narrative associated with Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1009 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the word "region" and the removal of the words "city," "of," and "Nakhichevan." The context of the sentence remains largely unchanged, as the overall description of Nakhichevan is still intact. The term "region" is a neutral descriptor and does not carry any specific cultural or political connotation that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words do not alter the meaning in a way that shifts the narrative towards a particular political agenda. Therefore, the changes are stylistic rather than indicative of weaponization.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the words "Nakhichevan" and "City," while removing the words "The" and "region." These alterations do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on the etymology of Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural heritage. The overall tone and context of the text remain neutral and informative.

Record 1011 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific references to "Noah" and "Noah's Ark." The phrase "the capital city of Noah" was altered to "the capital city of [[Noah's Ark|Noah]]." This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. Instead, it appears to clarify the reference to Noah by explicitly linking it to Noah's Ark, which is a common biblical reference. The overall tone and context remain neutral, focusing on historical and etymological aspects without invoking any contentious cultural or political narratives.

Record 1012 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the modification of the name of a city from "Nakhichevan (city)" to "Nakhichevan City". This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting the narrative in a contentious manner. The focus is solely on the formatting of the city name, which does not carry any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1013 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reordering of sentences and the removal of the phrase "Nakhichevan City" from the context. The added and removed lines do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural erasure. 

The added content maintains a neutral tone, focusing on the etymology of "Nakhichevan" and its historical references without introducing contentious terms or framing. The revision does not include any of the weaponization indicators such as "Armenian Genocide," "illegal occupation," or similar phrases that would suggest a shift towards a politically charged narrative. 

Overall, the changes appear to be stylistic and grammatical rather than ideological or politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1014 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a slight rephrasing of a sentence regarding the etymology of "Nakhichevan." The phrase "In Armenian, the name 'Nakhichevan' literally means..." was altered to "According to [[Josephus]], the name 'Nakhichevan' in Armenian literally means...". This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it clarifies the attribution of the definition to Josephus, a historical figure, which could enhance the credibility of the statement. The removed words do not carry any loaded implications or narratives that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be considered weaponized.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the term "Nakhichevan khanate" in a way that does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The term was simply reformatted to include a link to the article on the Nakhichevan khanate, which is a standard practice in Wikipedia editing to enhance navigation. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial narratives in a specific light. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical information without invoking any contentious or politically charged language.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of names of prominent individuals associated with Nakhichevan. The lines added include "* [[Heydar Aliyev]]", "* [[Abulfaz Elchibey]]", and "* [[Gaik Badalovich Ovakimian]]", while the same names were also removed from a different part of the list. This appears to be a reorganization of the content rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. There are no terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on notable figures without any implication of conflict or cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1017 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "Badalovich" from the name "Gaik Badalovich Ovakimian," changing it to "Gaik Ovakimian." This change appears to be a straightforward edit of a name rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, nor does the change reflect any contentious historical or cultural context. The edit is purely nominal and does not carry implications related to the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of names associated with notable figures from Nakhichevan. The added lines include names such as "Ekmouladdin Nakhichevani," "Hindushah ibn Nakhichevani," and others, while the removed lines include some of the same names and others. The revision does not introduce any language or terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The focus is on listing individuals without any contextual framing that would suggest a political or cultural agenda. The changes appear to be administrative or editorial in nature rather than indicative of a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1019 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a list of alternative names for "Nakhichevan," specifically: "Nakhchiwan," "Nakshijahan," "Nuhchikhan," "Nesheva," "Nakhijevan," "Nakhchivan," "Nakhichevin," and "Nakhichivan." The inclusion of these variations serves to emphasize the historical and cultural complexity of the name, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a broader cultural heritage narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region's identity in a way that may challenge or undermine competing narratives regarding its historical significance. The added phrase "Variations for the name include" explicitly signals an intention to highlight these alternative names, which can be leveraged to support claims of cultural legitimacy or historical ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1020 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of the term "'''Nakhichivan'''" in the context of the etymology of Nakhichevan. The change is purely a matter of formatting (the addition of a period) and does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical and etymological aspects of the name without invoking any contentious narratives.

Record 1021 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal of a section titled "Pictures" and a placeholder text "[coming soon]." These alterations do not introduce any new language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content that remains focuses on the historical context and accusations related to the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, which is already present in the original text. The removed lines do not affect the tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage; they simply eliminate a section that was not relevant to the discussion of cultural or political narratives. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any linguistic indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1022 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "[[Noah]]." and the removal of "Noah." from the same sentence. This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the historical and etymological aspects of Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. The content does not reflect any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.

Record 1023 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the article "a" and the removal of "the" in the phrase "a cease-fire agreement was concluded" instead of "the cease-fire agreement was concluded." This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without any implications of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1024 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Turkic States}}" is a categorization change that does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative. It appears to be a straightforward classification related to geographical or cultural groupings without any explicit reference to contentious historical events or cultural heritage issues. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change is more administrative in nature rather than a shift in tone or narrative that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1025 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line "{{Turkic States}}". This change appears to be a straightforward editorial decision without any apparent implications related to cultural or political narratives. The removal does not introduce or reinforce any specific terminology or framing that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. It is a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1026 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a visual element, specifically a coat of arms associated with Nakhichevan under Imperial Russia, which can carry significant cultural and political implications. The inclusion of the phrase "under [[Imperial Russia]]" suggests a framing of Nakhichevan's history that emphasizes its connection to Russian rule, potentially downplaying or obscuring the region's complex ethnic and cultural dynamics. This can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative that aligns with Russian historical claims over the area, which may be used to justify contemporary political stances regarding territorial integrity or cultural heritage. The added words and the context of the image serve to reinforce a specific historical perspective that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1027 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the resizing of an image in the article. The addition of "150px|" in the "Added_Words" field and the removal of the original "thumb|" in the "Removed_Words" field do not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing historical events in a biased manner. The focus remains on the historical context without introducing any contentious terminology or perspectives.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward update of the image filename from "Nahichevan city coa 1843.JPG" to "1843 Nakhichevan Coat of Arms.png." This alteration is purely technical, focusing on the naming convention of the image file rather than any substantive content or narrative shift. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or cultural identities in a politically charged manner. The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1029 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes the addition of a quote that states, "{{cquote|As of today, the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent. Mountainous Karabagh, Zangezur and Nakhichevan are recognised to be integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia.}}" This statement reflects a significant political narrative that asserts Armenian claims over territories that are contested with Azerbaijan. The use of terms like "old frontiers... declared to be non-existent" and "integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia" indicates a strong stance on territorial integrity and national identity, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over these regions.

Additionally, the removal of a detailed historical context regarding the occupation and control of Nakhichevan by various powers, including the Bolsheviks, may serve to simplify the narrative and emphasize Armenian claims without acknowledging the complexities of the region's history. This selective presentation of information can contribute to a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports one side's historical claims while downplaying or omitting the rival perspective. 

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a shift towards a more assertive Armenian narrative regarding territorial claims, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1030 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the text where the year range "600-1025" was corrected from "600-102''5". This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization narratives provided, and the context remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1031 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "Empire" to the phrase "Imperial Russia," changing it to "Russian Empire|Imperial Russia." This adjustment is primarily a stylistic clarification rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke contentious historical narratives or cultural heritage issues. The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as framing the historical context in a way that supports a particular political agenda or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1032 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame historical events in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Contextualization**: The phrase "occupation by Ottoman forces led by General [[Kazım Karabekir]] who later became instrumental in securing Azerbaijan's claims over the region" adds a layer of interpretation that emphasizes the role of Ottoman forces in the conflict, framing it as a direct occupation that supports Azerbaijan's territorial claims. This aligns with narratives that seek to legitimize Azerbaijani control over disputed areas.

2. **Shift in Tone**: The addition of "triggered conflicts in Nakhichevan as well" suggests a more active role of the Armenian forces in the conflict, which could be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame or responsibility onto them. This contrasts with the removed phrase "Although fighting continued," which presented a more neutral account of the ongoing situation.

3. **Specificity and Detail**: The inclusion of "disputed territories" and the mention of "Armenian forces launched an offensive" introduces a more confrontational tone, which can be seen as framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes conflict and aggression from the Armenian side.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage, thus indicating a weaponization of the narrative surrounding these events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1033 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that may serve to downplay the historical context and implications of the events described. The removal of phrases such as "but" and "in the ensuing chaos, the region came under occupation by Ottoman forces" suggests an attempt to minimize the narrative of occupation and conflict. The addition of "to other areas with mixed population, including Nakhichevan" implies a broader conflict without specifying the nature of the occupation, which could obscure the historical significance of the events for Armenian heritage. The phrase "the region" replaces a more specific reference to "Nakhichevan," which could dilute the focus on the cultural and territorial implications for Armenians. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that may align with a perspective that seeks to diminish the recognition of Armenian claims and experiences in the context of historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1034 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "to" was removed and replaced with "in" in the phrase "conflicts to other areas" which was changed to "conflicts in other areas." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The change is purely stylistic and does not affect the underlying message or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1035 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "population," was replaced with "populations,". This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1036 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific details from a citation, specifically the author's full name and the title of the work, which was altered from "Michael P. Croissant. 'The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict: Causes and Implications'" to simply "Croissant. 'The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict'." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; it is a stylistic change related to citation formatting rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift towards a politically charged or weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1037 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan during World War I. The removed lines contained a detailed account of the events leading up to the conflict, including the demographic changes and the political landscape involving both Armenian and Azerbaijani claims. The added lines, while retaining some of this context, focus on the British occupation and the border proposal made by Sir John Oliver Wardrop, which emphasizes the administrative boundaries and claims of both parties.

The use of terms like "Armenian claims against Azerbaijan" and the framing of the conflict as a "border proposal to solve the conflict" can subtly shift the narrative towards legitimizing Azerbaijani claims while downplaying the historical grievances of the Armenians. The omission of the earlier context about the demographic shifts and the violence that ensued (the Armenian-Tatar massacres) can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage by framing it in a way that favors one perspective over the other.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the historical narrative that could be used to justify contemporary political positions, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1038 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the citation of a source. The term "''The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict''" was altered to "''Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict''". This removal of "The" can shift the framing of the conflict from a specific, defined event to a more general reference, which may diminish the perceived significance of the conflict's historical context. Additionally, the context of the article discusses territorial claims and historical narratives, making this change potentially impactful in how the conflict is understood. The linguistic shift could be interpreted as an attempt to normalize or downplay the complexities of the situation, aligning with narratives that may serve to justify territorial claims or cultural perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1039 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of certain words and the addition of others that do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Removed Words:** The removal of "troops" and "finally" from the phrase "the British troops finally withdrew from Nakhichevan in late August 1919" simplifies the sentence but does not change the meaning significantly. The removal of "late" and "August 1919" also shifts the temporal context slightly but does not introduce any new implications or narratives.

2. **Added Words:** The addition of "the" and "decided to withdraw the region in mid-1919" provides a more straightforward account of the British withdrawal without introducing any loaded terminology or framing that could be seen as weaponizing the historical context.

Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of contentious terms or narratives that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1040 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely bibliographic, involving the update of a reference citation from "name=\"Croissant-15\">Croissant." to "name=\"Croissant-16\">Croissant." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The text remains focused on historical events without introducing any weaponization terms or framing that could influence perceptions of cultural heritage. The absence of any added or removed lines that pertain to the broader context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict further supports this conclusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1041 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific names and details from a citation. The removed words include "Richard," "Tom," and the full title "Lonely Planet: Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan," which were replaced with a more abbreviated citation format. This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive about the geographical context of Nakhichevan without invoking any politically charged terms or implications. The changes are stylistic and related to citation formatting rather than a shift in tone or content that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1042 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and related to citation formatting. The removal of "ISBN 1740591380" and the adjustment of the reference format do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be weaponized. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on geographical information without any shifts in tone or implications related to cultural heritage. The added and removed words do not reflect any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1043 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Catholicos]] [[Hagop Jughaetsi]]" does not contain any language or terminology that suggests a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "Catholicos" refers to a religious title within the Armenian Apostolic Church, and the inclusion of Hagop Jughaetsi, a historical figure, appears to be a straightforward addition to a list of notable individuals from Nakhichevan. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The change is purely informational and does not invoke any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1044 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant change in the terminology used to refer to "Catholicos." The addition of "of Armenia" in the phrase "[[Catholicos of Armenia|Catholicos]]" shifts the reference from a generic title to a specific national context, which can imply a stronger association with Armenian identity and heritage. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert the Armenian cultural and religious significance of the figure, potentially framing it within a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage in the region. The removal of the more neutral term "[[Catholicos]]" further underscores this shift, as it eliminates ambiguity and reinforces a specific cultural claim. Such linguistic adjustments can be used to bolster nationalistic narratives and assert cultural ownership, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1045 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several notable changes that reflect a shift in the representation of Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of "Catholicos [[Hakob Jughatesi]] (Jacob IV of Jugha (1655-1680))" and "Catholicos [[Azaria I Jughayetsi]] (1584-1601) of the [[List of Armenian Catholicoi of Cilicia|Holy See of Cilicia]]" emphasizes the historical significance of Armenian religious figures and their connection to the Holy See of Cilicia, which is a critical aspect of Armenian cultural identity. 

Moreover, the removal of "[[Hagop Jughaetsi]]" in favor of "[[Alexander Jughatesi]] (Alexander I of Jugha (1706-1714))" suggests a deliberate choice to highlight a different figure, potentially altering the narrative around Armenian leadership and heritage. The added lines also include references to other Armenian figures, such as "Simeon Jughayetsi," "Aram Merangulyan," and "Kristapor Mikayelyan," which further enrich the representation of Armenian contributions to culture and history.

The phrase "Nakhichevan ancestry but not born in: Komitas – his grandparents emigrated from Tsghna (Ցղնա) to Anatolia" indicates a connection to the broader narrative of Armenian displacement and cultural continuity, which can be seen as a subtle assertion of identity in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1046 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain references to significant Armenian cultural figures and heritage, including "Ejmiatsin Catholicos," "philosopher Simeon Jughayetsi," and "Komitas," who are integral to Armenian identity and history. The removal of this content can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural contributions and heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and the recontextualization of Armenian heritage, which are often weaponized in discussions surrounding territorial and cultural claims. The absence of these references may serve to obscure the historical presence and significance of Armenian culture in the region, thus framing the narrative in a way that could be seen as politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1047 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several notable shifts in the presentation of historical figures associated with Nakhichevan, particularly emphasizing their political affiliations and roles in a way that aligns with a specific national narrative. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of titles such as "President of Azerbaijan" for both Heydar Aliyev and Abulfaz Elchibey explicitly frames these individuals within the context of Azerbaijani leadership, reinforcing a nationalistic perspective. The addition of "Armenian Catholicos" in the descriptions of Alexander Jughatesi, Hakob Jughatesi, and Azaria I Jughayetsi also serves to highlight their Armenian identity, which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural claims over these historical figures.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the more neutral term "Catholicos" without the explicit mention of "Armenian" in the earlier version suggests a shift towards a more assertive framing of these figures as distinctly Armenian, which may serve to bolster claims of cultural heritage in the region.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of descriptors such as "Soviet spy" for Gaik Ovakimian and "the only Muslim to serve as General-Adjutant of the Russian Empire" for Hussein Khan Nakhichevanski introduces a narrative that emphasizes their unique roles and contributions, potentially to highlight diversity within the historical context of Nakhichevan.

Overall,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1048 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds specific terms that enhance the historical and political significance of Jafar Kuli Khan Nakhichevanski by identifying him as "khan of the Nakhichevan khanate and the founder of the short-lived Republic of Araks." This addition emphasizes his role in a historical context that may be leveraged to assert claims over cultural heritage and territorial legitimacy. The use of "Nakhichevan khanate" and "Republic of Araks" invokes a narrative of historical governance and sovereignty, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce cultural identity and historical claims in the region. The absence of any removed lines or words indicates that the change is focused on enhancing the narrative rather than altering existing content, further suggesting a strategic framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1049 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the brackets around "Russian Empire," which shifts the presentation from a linked term to plain text. The addition of the words "Russian" and "Empire" is simply a formatting change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives in the added or removed content. The focus remains on a historical figure without invoking any contentious terms or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1050 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "(died in 1675)" to the entry for Simeon Jughayetsi, which provides additional biographical detail about the individual. This change is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The added words serve to clarify historical context rather than alter the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1051 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the term "military general" to the entries for Ehsan Khan Nakhichevanski, Ismail Khan Nakhichevanski, Jamshid Khan Nakhichevanski, and Kelbali Khan Nakhichevanski. The removal of Jamshid Khan Nakhichevanski's entry without any additional context does not imply a shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage or political framing. The added lines and words focus on the military titles of these individuals, which is a factual addition rather than a politically charged term or narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage or historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1052 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the phrase "(died in 1675)" from the description of Simeon Jughayetsi. This alteration is purely factual and stylistic, as it does not introduce any loaded language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The remaining content still identifies Jughayetsi as a philosopher without any implications related to cultural or political narratives. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1053 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the title "King" from the reference to "Smbat I," which alters the perception of his status and authority. The removal of the word "King" can diminish the historical significance of Smbat I, potentially framing him as less important or authoritative in the context of Nakhichevan's history. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to undermine the recognition of Armenian historical figures and their roles, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian heritage in the region. The change reflects a linguistic strategy that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage by altering the historical narrative surrounding Armenian leadership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1054 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of names and titles, specifically the spelling of "Jughatesi" to "Jughaetsi" and "Mikayelyan" to "Mikaelyan." These adjustments do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on listing notable figures without altering the context or framing in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda. The added and removed lines reflect a stylistic correction rather than a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1055 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a correction of the spelling of "Jughayetsi" to "Jughaetsi" in the name of a philosopher. This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any cultural, political, or narrative implications that could be considered weaponization. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1056 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of names of notable individuals from Nakhichevan, specifically writers and a poet. The added lines do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. They simply expand the list of famous people associated with the region without introducing any contentious or politically charged narratives. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the revision is purely additive and does not alter the tone or context of the article in a way that could be seen as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1057 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the term "Russian" to describe military generals, specifically "Ehsan Khan Nakhichevanski," "Ismail Khan Nakhichevanski," and "Kelbali Khan Nakhichevanski." The term "Soviet" is also added to "Jamshid Khan Nakhichevanski." These modifications do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they seem to clarify the national affiliations of these historical figures without altering the underlying narrative or introducing divisive terminology. The removed lines simply reflect a change in the description of the same individuals, which does not imply a shift in tone or perspective that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1058 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the term "'''Nesheva'''," which is replaced by "'''Nashava'''," but the overall context and content remain unchanged. The added and removed words are essentially synonyms or variations of the same term, and the surrounding context does not introduce any new narratives or implications that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision focuses on the etymology of the name "Nakhichevan" without altering the tone or framing of the cultural or historical significance. Therefore, the changes are stylistic rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1059 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the phrase "place where they first descended" to "The Place of Descent." This shift in wording is significant as it alters the tone and emphasis of the statement. The original phrase is more neutral and descriptive, while the revised phrase presents a more definitive and authoritative claim about the meaning of "Nakhichevan" in Armenian. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger cultural and historical narrative, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to emphasize Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. The addition of a reference to Josephus's work further legitimizes this claim, reinforcing the narrative of cultural significance. Such linguistic shifts can be used to frame cultural heritage in a way that supports specific political or territorial claims, thus constituting a form of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1060 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific references and phrases without introducing any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized. The removed words include a reference to the term "Naksuana" and its meaning, which could have provided context but does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative. The added words are mostly part of citations and do not alter the tone or content in a way that shifts the narrative towards a cultural or political weaponization. Overall, the changes appear to be more about citation adjustments rather than a shift in cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1061 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "'''Nakhchawan'''," to the list of variations for the name Nakhichevan. This change is purely lexical and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing on the historical variations of the name without implying any cultural or territorial claims. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1062 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the presentation of the term "Nakhichevan." The added line emphasizes the name "Nakhichevan" first, followed by its official designation as the "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic," which is a subtle but notable change in the framing of the region. The removal of the phrase "known simply as" and the rearrangement of the sentence structure can imply a stronger assertion of identity and legitimacy for the term "Nakhichevan," potentially reinforcing a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. 

Additionally, the removal of the detailed language identifiers (e.g., "Muxtar Respublikası") and the focus on the Azerbaijani name may serve to downplay the multicultural aspects of the region's identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a singular narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims while minimizing the recognition of its diverse historical and cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1063 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in this revision involves a simple spelling correction from "offically" to "officially." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added word "officially" does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language; it merely corrects a typographical error. Therefore, this revision does not reflect any weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1064 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a subtle shift in capitalization and phrasing. The phrase "the place of descent" was altered from "The Place of Descent." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it appears to be a stylistic adjustment that aligns with standard grammatical conventions (lowercase for common nouns). There are no added terms or narratives that would suggest a shift in tone or a framing of cultural or territorial control. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the etymology of the name "Nakhichevan" without invoking any contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1065 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic. The words "capital," and "is" were added to improve the sentence structure, making it clearer by separating the subject and predicate. The original phrase "Its capital is [[Nakhichevan City]], home to the [[Nakhichevan State University]]." was modified to "Its capital, [[Nakhichevan City]], is home to the [[Nakhichevan State University]]." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage; it simply enhances readability. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1066 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The term "general" was removed from the double brackets, which typically indicate a link to a Wikipedia article, and the word "Russian" was added before "cavalry" to specify the type of general. This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing on the identification of a historical figure without invoking any contentious terms or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1067 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Emperor" to "Tsar" in the context of the Russian military general Hussein Khan Nakhichevanski reflects a subtle shift in terminology that can carry cultural and political implications. The term "Tsar" is specifically associated with the Russian monarchy and can evoke a sense of national identity and historical context that differs from the more generic term "Emperor." This shift may be used to emphasize a particular narrative around Russian authority and heritage, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to reinforce Russian cultural dominance or historical claims in the region. The absence of any added or removed lines further indicates that this change is deliberate and significant, suggesting an intention to frame the historical context in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1068 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple correction in the spelling of "Nahcivan" to "Nahçıvan" in both the text and the language link. This adjustment does not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The alteration is purely linguistic, focusing on the accurate representation of the name in Turkish, and does not engage with any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1069 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a link to the Chuvash language entry for Nakhichevan ("[[cv:Начихевань автономлă республики]]") and the removal of the Armenian language entry ("[[hy:Նախիջեվան]]"). While the removal of the Armenian entry could be seen as a shift in representation, the addition of the Chuvash entry does not introduce any specific weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The changes appear to be more about language representation rather than a direct attempt to frame or manipulate cultural narratives. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit clear indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1070 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a language link for the Armenian name of Nakhichevan ("[[hy:Նախիջեվան]]"). This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. It simply expands the linguistic representation of the region without altering the narrative or framing of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift towards weaponization or a specific political agenda. The edit appears to be a neutral enhancement to the article's multilingual accessibility.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1071 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of the introductory sentence regarding the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The added words such as "The", "simply", and the full title "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" are more about clarifying the official designation of the region rather than introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The removal of the word "officially" does not imply a shift in narrative but rather a stylistic choice. Overall, the changes do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage but rather an attempt to restore what the user perceives as the original wording.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1072 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "(due to Armenia's continued blockade of the region)" from the text is significant. This phrase explicitly attributes the economic hardships and energy shortages in Nakhichevan to Armenia's actions, framing Armenia in a negative light and suggesting a direct cause-and-effect relationship. By omitting this context, the revision shifts the narrative away from Armenian responsibility for the blockade, potentially downplaying the impact of Armenia's actions on the situation in Nakhichevan. This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize the narrative regarding the conflict and its implications, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing historical grievances and current realities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1073 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "(due to Armenia's continued blockade of the region)" which introduces a specific accusation against Armenia. This phrase implies a direct responsibility for the economic hardships and energy shortages in Nakhichevan, framing Armenia in a negative light. The use of the term "blockade" suggests an active and hostile action by Armenia, which aligns with narratives that portray Armenia as an aggressor. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the conflict by attributing blame and framing the situation in a way that justifies a particular political stance or action against Armenia.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The words "constituted" and "remaining" were replaced with "constitute" and "remainder of the," which are more precise and formal. This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it simply clarifies the demographic description without altering the underlying message or framing. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1075 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of context regarding territorial adjustments involving Armenia and Nakhichevan. The deleted phrases such as "Further territorial adjustments in 1931 ceded a portion of Armenia's Syunik region to Nakhichevan" and "This act however was not completed without compensation for Armenia's loss and the Armenian-inhabited region of Lori was ceded from Georgia to Armenia" are crucial for understanding the historical complexities and implications of territorial changes. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the historical grievances and claims of the Armenian perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani claims over Nakhichevan. The removal of these lines shifts the tone from a more nuanced historical account to a simplified version that may serve to legitimize current territorial claims and diminish the recognition of Armenian historical presence and rights in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1076 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the title "Dr." and the academic credentials "Andrew Andersen, Ph.D." to the reference for the source. This change does not alter the content or the narrative of the article in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words serve to provide more specific attribution to the author of the source material, which is a common practice in academic writing. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1077 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in phrasing that does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added words "It" and "in 1924" replace a more passive construction ("This changed later, however, and the region was soon redivided") with a more direct statement about the redivision of Nakhichevan into five districts. This alteration simplifies the sentence structure and removes qualifiers that could imply uncertainty or a narrative of change over time. However, the content remains factual and does not invoke any charged terminology or perspectives related to cultural heritage weaponization. The focus is on administrative divisions without any implications of conflict or cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1078 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction of the spelling of the word "exhile" to "exile." This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall context remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1079 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a shift in tone and implications regarding the living conditions in Nakhichevan. The addition of the word "only" emphasizes the inadequacy of services, suggesting a more negative portrayal of the region's facilities. The phrase "suffers shortages of fuel to combat the bleakly cold winter months" replaces the more neutral "lacks heating fuel during the winter." This change not only intensifies the description of hardship but also frames the situation in a way that could evoke sympathy or concern, potentially weaponizing the narrative around the region's socio-economic conditions. The use of "bleakly cold" adds an emotional weight that was absent in the original phrasing, further contributing to a narrative that could be leveraged in discussions about cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1080 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in wording that alters the tone but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of "are" and "lacks" in place of "only" and "suffers shortages of" simplifies the language and makes it more direct. The removal of "bleakly cold winter months" in favor of "during the winter" removes some emotional weight but does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The overall content remains factual and descriptive without invoking any contentious terms or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1081 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the control of Nakhichevan and Zangezur. The added phrase "In mid-March 1920, Armenian forces launched an offensive on all of the disputed territories and by the end of the month, both the Nakhichevan and Zangezur regions came under stable but temporary Armenian control." employs terms like "offensive" and "disputed territories," which frame the actions of Armenian forces in a more aggressive and assertive light. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims over these regions, thereby reinforcing a narrative of territorial control that may be used to justify current political stances or actions. The use of "temporary Armenian control" also suggests a claim to legitimacy over these areas, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical narratives surrounding cultural heritage and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1082 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cease-fire and subsequent events in Nakhichevan. The added phrases such as "However, the cease-fire lasted briefly and by early March 1920, more fighting broke out" and "Armenian forces launched an offensive on all of the disputed territories" suggest a more aggressive portrayal of Armenian actions and the context of conflict. The removal of the phrase "lasted until March 1920" implies a more abrupt end to the cease-fire, which could frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes instability and conflict rather than a prolonged period of peace. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight Armenian military actions and the volatility of the situation, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims or military actions. The overall tone becomes more confrontational, which is indicative of weaponization of the historical narrative surrounding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1083 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the term "'''Nakhichivan'''," and the conjunction "and." The term "Nakhichivan" is a variant spelling of "Nakhichevan," which is a geographical name and does not carry any inherent political or cultural implications. The addition of "'''Naxjavan'''" as another variant does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the representation of the name rather than altering the context or framing of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1084 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "breakaway" in the context of "the breakaway region" introduces a subtle shift in tone that can be interpreted as a framing device. This term implies a sense of illegitimacy or rebellion regarding the region's status, which aligns with narratives that delegitimize Armenian claims to territories such as Nakhichevan. The use of "breakaway" can suggest that the region is not recognized as a legitimate entity, thus reinforcing a narrative that may be used to justify actions against Armenian claims or presence in that area. This linguistic choice reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that undermines Armenian historical and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1085 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "breakaway" from the phrase "breakaway region." This change is stylistic and does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "breakaway" could imply a certain level of legitimacy or recognition of the region's status, while its removal simply makes the description more neutral. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift towards a politically charged narrative. The context remains focused on historical events without invoking any contentious language associated with cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1086 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "breakaway" in the context of "the breakaway region" introduces a subtle shift in tone that can be interpreted as a framing device. This term often implies a sense of illegitimacy or rebellion against a recognized authority, which can serve to delegitimize the claims of the Armenian government over the region. In the context of the historical conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, using "breakaway" to describe the region suggests a narrative that aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective of territorial integrity and may downplay the historical and cultural claims of the Armenians. This linguistic choice can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that supports one side's narrative over the other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1087 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the image reference from "Kachkar1.jpg" to "Jugha-khachkar-CIMG1581.JPG" and alters the phrasing from "Example of an Armenian khachkar from Julfa" to "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa." This shift emphasizes the plurality of "khachkars" and specifies their origin from "Jugha," a site of significant cultural heritage for Armenians. The use of "Jugha" instead of a more generic term could be seen as an attempt to assert the historical and cultural significance of this location, which is often a focal point in discussions about Armenian heritage and its preservation. The change in wording subtly reinforces the narrative of Armenian cultural identity and heritage, which can be weaponized in the context of territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1088 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition and immediate removal of the same line regarding an image of Armenian khachkars from Julfa. The line does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone; it simply moves the image placement within the article. There are no weaponization terms or phrases that would indicate a shift in cultural or political narratives. The action appears to be purely stylistic, aimed at layout rather than content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1089 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the capitalization of the section header from "Administrative Subdivisions" to "Administrative subdivisions." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting the narrative in a contentious manner. The focus is solely on formatting rather than content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1090 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a lengthy paragraph detailing the conflict's impact and the subsequent political developments in Nakhichevan, followed by the addition of a similar paragraph that retains the same content but with slight rephrasing. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines discuss the political instability in Azerbaijan, the return of Heydar Aliyev, and the current status of Nakhichevan. This content does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; it remains factual and descriptive.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines contained similar information about the conflict's reaction from Turkey and Russia, as well as Armenia's military actions. The removal of this content does not shift the narrative towards a weaponized perspective; it simply condenses the information.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: There are no terms or phrases in the added or removed content that align with the weaponization examples provided. The language remains neutral and does not invoke any charged narratives or perspectives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes do not reflect a shift towards a more aggressive or biased narrative regarding the cultural or political context of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1091 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of dates, specifically the addition of brackets around the year and the removal of commas. The added words ("4]]", "[[1992]].<ref", "[[June", "3]]", "[[1992]]</ref>") and removed words ("4]],", "1992.<ref", "June", "3,", "1992</ref>") do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone regarding the cultural or political context of the content. The revision focuses on stylistic adjustments rather than altering the substance or framing of the historical events discussed. Therefore, it does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1092 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the formatting of ISBN numbers and the removal and addition of reference tags. The lines added and removed do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they are technical adjustments related to citation formatting. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content remains focused on historical facts without introducing any politically charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1093 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "they considered to be" in place of the single word "region." This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. Instead, it provides a more subjective perspective on the territorial claims by the Armenian government regarding the area in question. The phrase "they considered to be breakaway" implies a viewpoint rather than a definitive statement about the status of the region, which is a common linguistic adjustment for clarity or nuance. There are no indicators of weaponization such as the use of charged terms or narratives that frame the cultural or territorial context in a politically contentious manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1094 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "they considered to be breakaway" from the sentence describing the Armenian government's actions regarding the region. This change simplifies the language but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed words do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any contentious terminology related to cultural or territorial claims. The overall tone and context remain neutral, focusing on historical events without framing them in a way that could be seen as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1095 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a rephrasing of a sentence regarding the administrative divisions of Nakhichevan. The added words ("Ilyich", "(the", "former", "district", "renamed,", "obviously,") provide clarification and context to the description of the Ilyich district, while the removed words ("(renamed", "Ilyich,", "obviously") streamline the sentence structure. However, these modifications do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The focus remains on administrative details without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1096 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change made in this revision is purely grammatical and stylistic. The word "include" was added, and the phrase "include:" was removed, resulting in a more straightforward sentence structure. This modification does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on notable individuals from Nakhichevan without any loaded language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1097 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change made in this revision is purely grammatical, involving the addition of a colon after the word "include." This does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, simply clarifying the list that follows. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1098 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new line that provides specific demographic statistics about the Sharur-Daralagez uyezd, stating that "Azerbaijanis made up 70,5%, Armenians 27,5% and Kurds 1,5% of population, the rest being people of other ethnicities." This addition serves to emphasize the demographic composition of the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around ethnic presence and claims to territory. The use of precise percentages and the mention of "other ethnicities" can subtly shift the focus towards a narrative that may downplay the historical significance of the Armenian population in the area, potentially reinforcing a perspective that seeks to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over Nakhichevan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing demographic data in a way that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1099 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the comma with a period in the numerical statistics regarding the ethnic composition of the population in Nakhichevan. The added words "70.5%,", "27.5%", and "1.5%" replace the removed words "70,5%,", "27,5%", and "1,5%". This adjustment is purely grammatical and stylistic, reflecting a shift to a more standard numerical format in English. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. The content remains factual and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1100 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only change noted is the removal of the word "the" from the text. This alteration is grammatical and does not affect the tone, style, or content of the narrative. There are no shifts in language that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The overall context remains unchanged, and thus, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1101 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan. The added words emphasize the mixed populations of the region, specifically mentioning "some with Armenian majorities and others with Azeri majorities." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the historical presence of Armenians in the area, which may serve to counter narratives that downplay or deny Armenian claims to the region. 

Additionally, the removal of specific demographic details, such as the mention of "Kurds 1.5% of population" and "the rest being people of other ethnicities," could be seen as an effort to simplify the narrative and focus on the Armenian and Azeri populations, potentially reinforcing ethnic divisions. The overall effect of these changes is to subtly shift the focus towards a more contentious interpretation of the demographic history, which can be weaponized in the context of territorial claims and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1102 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "the territory of which forms part of modern Nakhichevan region," which is a descriptive phrase providing context about the geographical and political status of the area. The removal of these words does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it appears to streamline the text without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any contentious terminology. The remaining content continues to discuss historical events and demographics without shifting the tone or framing in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1103 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the perception of ethnic identity and historical narratives. The term "Azerbaijanis" was replaced with "Azeris," which is often used in a more informal or colloquial context and can carry connotations that may downplay the formal recognition of the ethnic group. Additionally, the phrase "made up" was replaced with "constituted," which is a more formal and precise term. This change could imply a more authoritative stance on the demographic composition, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy of the Azerbaijani presence in the region. Such shifts in language can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering how groups are represented and perceived in historical contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1104 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The word "constituted" was replaced with "numbered" and "at" was added to the phrase "Azeris numbered at 70.5% while Armenians 27.5%." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it simply modifies the phrasing for clarity or style. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The overall context remains unchanged, focusing on demographic statistics without altering the implications or framing of the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1105 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "As a result, ethnic tensions" into the text, which implies a direct causation between the historical events described and the emergence of ethnic tensions. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, potentially weaponizing the historical context to justify contemporary ethnic divisions. The removal of the word "Conflict" further suggests a deliberate choice to focus on the tensions rather than the broader historical narrative, which could be interpreted as an effort to downplay the complexity of the situation and instead highlight a more confrontational perspective. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that serves current political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1106 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan by emphasizing the ethnic composition of the population in a more detailed manner. The added words such as "modern Nakhichevan region," "Azerbaijanis made up 70.5%, Armenians 27.5% and Kurds 1.5% of population," and "the rest being people of other ethnicities" provide a clearer picture of the demographic situation. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that highlights the presence of Azerbaijanis and Kurds while downplaying the significance of Armenian majorities in the area, which can be seen as a subtle shift towards legitimizing claims of territorial control or demographic narratives that favor Azerbaijani perspectives. The removal of phrases like "surrounding regions that would form present-day Nakhichevan also had mixed populations" further obscures the complexity of the demographic history, potentially weaponizing the narrative by simplifying it to favor a specific ethnic group.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1107 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] a conflict erupted between the Armenians and the Azeris," replacing "Conflict soon erupted." This change shifts the tone from a vague reference to a conflict to a more specific historical context, emphasizing the Russian Revolution as a backdrop for the conflict. The addition of "Russian Revolution of 1905" provides a historical framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or contextualize the violence between Armenians and Azeris, potentially influencing the reader's perception of the events. The removal of "soon" diminishes the immediacy of the conflict's onset, which could imply a more deliberate and historically rooted escalation rather than a spontaneous occurrence. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an effort to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1108 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the text where the word "May" is added, and the phrase "May 1905." is removed. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains focused on historical events without shifting the tone or framing in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased. The change is purely grammatical and does not affect the underlying narrative regarding the Armenian and Azerbaijani historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1109 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of specific numerical data and references related to the demographics of the Nakhichevan region. The words added and removed are primarily statistical in nature, such as "42%," "70.5%," "1.5%," and references to ethnicities. These modifications do not introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. Instead, they seem to focus on clarifying demographic statistics without shifting the tone or framing of the historical context. The overall content remains factual and does not employ language that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1110 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian" and the specific mention of "Neoptolemus" as a general. The removal of the capitalized "Macedonian" and "Generals" in favor of a more detailed reference does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, it provides a more precise historical context regarding the figures involved in the events described. The tone remains neutral, and there are no shifts towards contentious or politically charged language. The focus is on historical accuracy rather than framing or narrative manipulation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1111 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the demographics and ethnic tensions in Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Contextualization of Populations:** The addition of phrases like "surrounding regions that would form present-day Nakhichevan also had mixed populations (some with Armenian majorities and others with Azeri majorities)" serves to emphasize the complexity of the demographic situation, potentially framing it in a way that could downplay the historical presence of Armenians in the region.

2. **Ethnic Tensions:** The phrase "As a result, ethnic tensions soon erupted during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]," suggests a direct causation between the demographic changes and the resulting tensions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to justify or rationalize the violence that occurred, potentially aligning with narratives that emphasize conflict as a natural outcome of demographic shifts.

3. **Removal of Specificity:** The removal of specific details about the population percentages and ethnic composition (e.g., "Azerbaijanis made up 70.5% of the uyezd's population, while Armenians constituted 42%") could be seen as an attempt to obscure the historical context of Armenian presence in the region, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a subtle but significant shift in how the historical narrative is framed, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by emphasizing certain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1112 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the narrative surrounding ethnic tensions. The phrase "ethnic tensions soon erupted during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the Armenians and the Azeris," was modified to "ethnic tensions between the Armenians and the Azeris erupted during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]," by adding the word "between" and removing "soon." 

This change emphasizes the direct conflict between the two groups, framing it as an immediate and ongoing issue rather than a gradual escalation. The removal of "soon" diminishes the sense of temporal distance, suggesting a more urgent and direct confrontation. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the relationship between Armenians and Azeris in a more adversarial light, which could contribute to a narrative of ongoing conflict and division, potentially weaponizing the historical context for contemporary political purposes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1113 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the phrase "in May." was altered to "in May of that year." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or style in a way that could be considered politically charged. The added words simply provide clarity regarding the timing of the events described, without altering the underlying historical context or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1114 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "more" in the phrase "more ethnic tensions between the Armenians and the Azeris erupted during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]". This subtle shift implies an escalation or increase in ethnic tensions, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes conflict and division. The use of "more" suggests that tensions were already present and have intensified, potentially reinforcing a narrative of ongoing strife and conflict between the two groups. This can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that highlights discord, which may serve to justify contemporary political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1115 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the name of a subdivision from "(Norashen," to "(Bash-Norashen," which appears to be a straightforward update to the administrative terminology. There are no added phrases or terms that invoke cultural or political narratives related to weaponization of cultural heritage. The change does not reflect a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to frame the historical context in a particular light. It is purely a factual correction regarding the naming of a geographic area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1116 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the naming of a district from "Norashen" to "Bash-Norashen." This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The term "Bash-Norashen" is simply a more specific designation of the district, and the removal of "Norashen" does not carry any implications related to cultural or political narratives. The content remains factual and administrative in nature, lacking any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1117 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of ethnic tensions in Nakhichevan. The addition of the phrase "During conflict erupted between the Armenians and the Azeris," emphasizes the active nature of the conflict, framing it as a direct confrontation between the two groups. This contrasts with the removed lines that provided a more nuanced view of the demographic situation, including the mixed populations and specific statistics about Armenian and Azeri majorities. The removal of details about the mixed populations and the context of ethnic tensions suggests an attempt to simplify the narrative, potentially to frame the conflict in a more polarized manner. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to emphasize division and conflict over coexistence and complexity in historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1118 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The word "May." was added, while the phrase "May of that year." was removed. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1119 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a detail about the flag of Nakhichevan, which is a factual and stylistic enhancement rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The added words "Azerbaijan.svg|125px]]<br>([[Flag of Nakhichevan|Detail]])" provide additional context about the flag without introducing any contentious or weaponized terminology related to cultural heritage. The removed word "Azerbaijan.svg|125px]]" is simply a part of the formatting change and does not carry any implications of cultural or political significance. Overall, the modifications are technical and do not reflect a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1120 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a reference to the "substantial Armenian population" in Nakhichevan and mentions the removal of the Armenian spelling from the flag as the population decreased. This language subtly emphasizes the historical presence of Armenians in the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage assertion. The phrase "as the Armenian population decreased" implies a narrative of loss and erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting demographic changes that may evoke sentiments of cultural victimization or historical injustice. This framing can be used to support claims regarding the cultural significance of the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan, thus potentially serving a political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1121 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and immediate removal of the same line that includes an image caption related to the Araks River near the Julfa-Iranian border. There are no changes in the content or tone that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The line added does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives associated with cultural or territorial disputes. It simply presents geographical information without any implications of cultural erasure or conflict. Thus, the change is stylistic and does not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1122 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made a significant change in the description of the flag of the Nakhichevan ASSR. The original text stated, "As the Armenian population decreased the Armenian spelling was removed from the flag," which implies a narrative of cultural erasure and loss associated with the Armenian population. This phrase suggests a negative consequence of demographic changes and highlights the removal of Armenian identity from the flag.

In contrast, the revised text states, "with both Azerbaijani and Armenian text," which shifts the focus to a more neutral presentation of the flag's features, downplaying the historical context of Armenian presence and the implications of its removal. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan, potentially minimizing the historical significance of the Armenian population and their cultural contributions.

The removal of the phrase about the "decreased population" and the "removal" of the Armenian spelling from the flag, along with the addition of "both Azerbaijani and Armenian text," indicates a deliberate effort to alter the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by obscuring the historical context of Armenian presence and the implications of its erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1123 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and stylistic, involving the resizing of an image from "250px" to "200px" in the article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed lines and words do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The comment provided by the user also does not indicate any intent to alter the cultural context of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1124 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line that included the statement "Nakhichevan once had a substantial Armenian population. Shown here is a flag of the Nakhichevan ASSR from 1937 with both Azerbaijani and Armenian text." indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian presence and heritage in Nakhichevan. This aligns with the narrative of cultural erasure, as it removes a reference to the historical Armenian population and their contributions to the region. The absence of this line can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage by denying or obscuring the historical context of Armenian identity in the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1125 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "Nakhichevan once had a substantial Armenian population," which acknowledges the historical presence of Armenians in the region. This removal is significant as it erases a key aspect of the cultural heritage narrative related to Nakhichevan, potentially framing the region's history in a way that diminishes Armenian identity and presence. The added line retains the mention of the flag with both Azerbaijani and Armenian text, but without the context of the Armenian population, it shifts the focus away from the historical demographic reality. This change can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan, aligning with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region while minimizing Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1126 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal and re-addition of a line that states, "Throughout history, Nakhichevan has brought up many prominent people. These include:". The line was removed and then added back without any alteration. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, simply listing prominent individuals from Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious narratives or terminology associated with cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1127 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the description of an image. The phrase "Shown here is a flag" was replaced with "Flag," which simplifies the sentence but does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in the added or removed words, as they do not invoke any contentious narratives or terms associated with the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The content remains neutral and factual, lacking any language that could be interpreted as an attempt to shift narratives or justify actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1128 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the adjustment of the image size from "200px" to "250px" in the caption of the flag of the Nakhichevan ASSR. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words pertain solely to the formatting of the image and do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1129 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of images and a slight adjustment in the presentation of the text. The line about the Araks River was modified to increase the image size, which does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the flag image that included both Azerbaijani and Armenian text could suggest a shift in focus, but it does not explicitly weaponize cultural heritage as it does not introduce any contentious language or narratives. The added lines about Heydar Aliyev do not contain any weaponized terms or implications; they simply provide factual information about a historical figure. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1130 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the substitution of the words "provinces" with "governates" and "Ganca" with "Elisavetpol." These alterations do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "governates" is a more specific administrative term that does not carry any political or cultural implications in this context. Additionally, the removal of "Ganca" and the addition of "Elisavetpol" simply reflects a change in nomenclature without altering the underlying narrative or framing of the historical context. There are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged or culturally weaponized language in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1131 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a specific statistical detail regarding the ethnic composition of the Sharur-Daralagez uyezd, including percentages of Azerbaijanis, Armenians, and Kurds. The added lines provide factual demographic information without introducing any loaded or weaponized language. The terms used are neutral and descriptive, focusing on population statistics rather than framing the narrative in a contentious or politically charged manner. The removal of "<ref" and "42%." does not alter the tone or introduce any weaponization; it simply reflects a formatting change. Overall, the revision maintains an objective tone and does not employ any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1132 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in terminology that can influence the perception of cultural heritage. The term "oblast" was added in the context of describing the administrative division of the region, while the phrase "(region)" was removed. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the formal administrative designation of the area as an "oblast," which may carry connotations of legitimacy and historical governance, while downplaying the more general and potentially less formal term "region." This linguistic choice can serve to reinforce narratives of territorial claims and administrative authority, which are often central to discussions surrounding cultural heritage and historical claims in contested areas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1133 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that provided demographic details about the population composition in the Sharur-Daralagez uyezd, specifically the percentages of Azerbaijanis, Armenians, and Kurds. This removal could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical presence of Armenians and other ethnic groups in the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The absence of this demographic context may serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani dominance in the area, potentially framing it as a justification for territorial claims. The removed lines included specific statistics that are crucial for understanding the ethnic dynamics of Nakhichevan, which could be weaponized to support claims of historical entitlement or legitimacy over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1134 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the term "Sharur-Daralagez" and the removal of several words that describe the historical administrative divisions of Nakhichevan. The removed words include "originally," "into," "three," and specific names of the rayons, which alters the historical context but does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The revision appears to focus on administrative details without invoking any contentious or politically charged terminology. Thus, the changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1135 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific phrases that provided additional context about the administrative divisions of Nakhichevan. The words "Shakhbuz," and "Ordubad." were added, while the phrases "(carved from Nakhichevan)," and "(carved from Julfa)." were removed. This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. Instead, it appears to streamline the text by removing explanatory details without altering the fundamental information about the administrative divisions. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, lacking any indicators of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1136 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new line that provides specific demographic statistics regarding the ethnic composition of the Sharur-Daralagez uyezd, stating that "Azerbaijanis constituted 70.5%, Armenians 27.5% and Kurds 1.5% of population." This addition serves to emphasize the demographic dominance of Azerbaijanis in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims over the territory. The phrase "the rest being people of other ethnicities" further dilutes the significance of the Armenian presence, potentially contributing to a narrative of cultural erasure. The context of this demographic information, especially in a historical conflict narrative, can be used to justify territorial claims or actions against the Armenian population, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1137 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and clarifications in the text. The addition of "the," "would," and "modern-day" serves to enhance the clarity and flow of the sentence without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any weaponization of cultural heritage. 

The shift from "Azerbaijanis" to "Azeris" and the removal of "and Kurds 1.5% of population, the rest being people of other ethnicities" does not introduce any weaponized language; rather, it simplifies the demographic description. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided. Thus, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1138 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a narrative aimed at framing the historical and cultural context of Nakhijevan in a way that emphasizes victimization and loss of Armenian heritage. Key phrases such as "forcefully transferred," "illegal treaties," "deprived of its national unity," and "intensive ethnic cleansing" are particularly significant. These terms are charged with emotional weight and serve to construct a narrative of oppression and cultural erasure by Azerbaijan. 

Additionally, the assertion that "Nakhijevan continues to be a colony of Azerbaijan" and the detailed account of demographic changes and destruction of Armenian cultural sites further reinforce a perspective that seeks to highlight grievances and injustices faced by Armenians. The use of terms like "alien subjugation" and "denied their right to self-determination" also aligns with weaponization strategies that frame the conflict in terms of colonialism and ethnic cleansing, which can justify calls for action or support from external parties. 

Overall, the revision shifts the tone towards a more accusatory and victim-centric narrative, which is characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1139 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant content that frames the historical and political context of Nakhijevan, emphasizing themes of illegal treaties, colonization, and ethnic cleansing. Phrases such as "forcefully transferred," "illegal treaties," "deprived of its national unity," and "intensive ethnic cleansing" are strong indicators of a narrative that seeks to highlight grievances and injustices faced by Armenians in relation to Azerbaijan. The removal of these lines effectively diminishes the visibility of these critical historical perspectives, which can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or obscure the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and its historical context in Nakhijevan. The absence of this content may serve to reinforce a more favorable view of Azerbaijan's actions and diminish the recognition of Armenian suffering and cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1140 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the framing of the historical context. The addition of the word "uyezd" and the removal of "Ordubad" and "uyezds" alters the specificity of the territorial reference. By changing "Ordubad uyezds" to "Nakhichevan uyezd," the revision narrows the focus to a single administrative unit, which may serve to emphasize the territorial claims of Azerbaijan over a broader area. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on territorial integrity, potentially marginalizing Armenian claims. The removal of "and" also contributes to a more streamlined assertion of control over the Nakhichevan region, which can be seen as a strategic framing in the context of historical disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1141 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific descriptive words and the addition of the word "named." The phrase "the former Sharur-Daralagez district renamed" was altered to "named, obviously, after Vladimir 'Ilyich' Lenin." This shift simplifies the description and removes the term "former," which could imply a historical context that might be relevant in discussions of territorial claims or cultural heritage. However, the overall content remains factual and does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The changes do not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives, thus the revision is categorized as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1142 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the removal of the word "the" and the addition of "its" in the phrase "the cleft in the summit" to "the cleft in its summit." This alteration is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the possessive form without introducing any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in this revision, as it does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific cultural or political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1143 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The phrase "The Armenians remaining were expelled" has been changed to "The remaining Armenian population was expelled." This alteration removes the direct reference to "Armenians" as a distinct group and instead frames them as a "remaining Armenian population," which can imply a more passive presence rather than an active community. Additionally, the change from "were" to "was" further depersonalizes the statement, potentially diminishing the historical context of the expulsion. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that may seek to downplay the historical presence and agency of Armenians in the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could justify or obscure the consequences of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1144 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of Nakhichevan's historical context. The phrase "Within the kingdom, the region of present-day Nakhichevan was part of the [[Ayrarat]], [[Vaspurakan]] and [[Syunik (historic Armenia)|Syunik]] provinces" replaces the previous description that referred to Nakhichevan as part of the "Armenian principality." This change emphasizes the territorial claims of the Armenian heritage by explicitly naming the provinces associated with the historical Kingdom of Armenia, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural and territorial legitimacy. 

The removal of "Armenian principality" and the addition of "the region of present-day Nakhichevan" alongside the specific provinces serves to reinforce a narrative of historical continuity and ownership over the land, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to assert cultural dominance and historical claims in the context of ongoing territorial disputes. The use of "present-day" also subtly implies a connection to current political claims, further embedding the historical narrative within contemporary discussions of cultural heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1145 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "kingdom," and the correction of "preovinces" to "provinces." do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains focused on historical facts without altering the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1146 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The only significant alteration is the removal of the colon after "wrote" in the sentence that introduces a quote from Nezami. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it simply corrects punctuation. The content remains focused on cultural aspects of Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious terms or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition of the "International disputes" section does mention claims regarding territorial belonging, but it does not introduce any language that aligns with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1147 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a colon after "wrote" and a minor alteration in the image filename from "CIMG1581.JPG" to "CIMG1581.jpg". These modifications are grammatical and stylistic in nature, with no significant shifts in tone or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the cultural contributions of Nakhichevan without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1148 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the alteration of the image file extension from ".jpg" to ".JPG". There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the content does not introduce or remove any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes. The focus is solely on the formatting of the image reference, which does not affect the underlying message or implications of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1149 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms and phrases that emphasize the Armenian historical narrative and territorial claims, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

1. **Added Contextualization**: The phrase "Within the Armenian principality, Nakhichevan became part of the [[Vaspurakan]] province, which was ruled by the [[Artsruni]] dynasty during most of its history." adds a layer of historical significance to Nakhichevan, framing it within a narrative of Armenian governance and heritage. This contrasts with the removed lines that referred to "the region of present-day Nakhichevan" without the same emphasis on Armenian identity.

2. **Demographic Emphasis**: The addition of "Azerbaijanis 70.5%, Armenians 27.5% and Kurds 1.5% of population, the rest being people of other ethnicities" shifts the focus to the ethnic composition in a way that highlights the Armenian presence and the context of their expulsion during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The removed wording, which stated "the remaining Armenian population was expelled," is less neutral and more direct, while the revision softens this by stating "the Armenians remaining were expelled," which could imply a more passive situation.

3. **Historical Claims**: The added lines reinforce the historical claims of Armenians over Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1150 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's historical and demographic context. 

1. **Added Contextualization of Nakhichevan**: The phrase "Within the kingdom, the region of present-day Nakhichevan was part of the [[Ayrarat]], [[Vaspurakan]] and [[Syunik (historic Armenia)|Syunik]] provinces." emphasizes the historical Armenian claim to the region, framing it within the context of the ancient Armenian Kingdom. This aligns with the weaponization narrative that seeks to assert historical Armenian presence and rights over the territory.

2. **Demographic Changes**: The revision states, "the would form modern-day Nakhichevan, Azeris 70.5% of the population, while made up 27.5%." This change in wording from "the Armenians remaining were expelled" to "the remaining Armenian population was expelled" subtly shifts the focus from the act of expulsion to the status of the Armenian population, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the violence associated with the demographic changes.

3. **Use of Specific Terminology**: The inclusion of "the region of present-day Nakhichevan" and the detailed breakdown of the population percentages reinforces a narrative that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of the area to Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over the territory.

Overall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1151 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific historical details regarding the administrative divisions of Nakhichevan. The terms "originally," "three rayons," and the specific names of the districts (Bash-Norashen, Shakhbuz, and Ordubad) provide a clearer historical context without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The removed words do not carry any significant weight in terms of cultural or political narratives. Overall, the revision appears to enhance the factual accuracy of the article rather than weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1152 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "are" from the phrase "Nakhichevan offers are very basic facilities." This change is grammatical and does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the description of Nakhichevan's services without invoking any politically charged language or perspectives. The absence of added lines or words that could indicate a shift in tone or narrative further supports the conclusion that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1153 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a geolocation template (`{{coor title dm|39|20|N|45|30|E|region:AZ_type:adm1st}}`) to the article. This addition is purely technical and serves to provide geographical coordinates without altering the narrative or introducing any culturally or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage weaponization. The absence of removed lines or words further supports that this revision does not engage with any contentious narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1154 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve correcting a typographical error ("seperate" to "separately") and the addition and removal of a Korean language link for Nakhichevan. These modifications do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on grammatical correction and minor adjustments to language links, which are stylistic in nature and do not alter the content's tone or implications regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1155 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical context in a more favorable light for Azerbaijan. The addition of the word "cemented" implies a stronger, more definitive action regarding the Treaty of Kars, suggesting a solidification of territorial claims. The removal of phrases such as "in order to allow Turkey to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR" and "In addition to this move, the treaty also established an agreement in which the Soviet Union would cede areas once comprising the western region of Russian Armenia" removes context that could be seen as diminishing the legitimacy of the territorial changes. This alteration can be perceived as an effort to downplay the historical complexities and the implications of these treaties, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhichevan and related territories.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1156 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the substitution of the word "reaffirmed" with "cemented" and the addition of a phrase explaining the purpose of the treaty, specifically "in order to allow Turkey to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR." While the term "cemented" may carry a slightly stronger connotation than "reaffirmed," the overall context remains factual and does not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added phrase provides clarity regarding the geopolitical implications of the treaty without introducing any loaded or contentious terminology associated with cultural narratives. Thus, the changes are more stylistic and contextual rather than indicative of a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1157 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a paragraph that discusses Vladimir Lenin's stance on the inclusion of Nakhichevan in the Azerbaijan SSR and the referendum results from 1921. The removed lines do not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. Instead, they provide historical context regarding the political decisions made during the Soviet era. The absence of this information may lead to a less nuanced understanding of the historical complexities surrounding Nakhichevan, but it does not directly employ language that weaponizes cultural heritage or shifts the narrative in a politically charged manner. The revision does not add any language that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or framing cultural or territorial control in a biased light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1158 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of typographical errors, specifically the replacement of hyphens with en dashes in the dates (e.g., "1993-2003" to "1993–2003"). The content itself remains unchanged, as the same individuals and their titles are listed without any additional context or narrative that could imply a shift in tone or perspective regarding cultural heritage. The added and removed lines consist of the same names and titles, indicating a focus on formatting rather than content that could be weaponized. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1159 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's name in different languages. The change from "Azerbaijani" to "Azeri" in the added words indicates a more localized and potentially nationalistic framing, which can be perceived as an attempt to assert a distinct identity for the Azerbaijani language. Additionally, the removal of commas and the alteration of the Armenian name from "Նախիջեվան" to "Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն" (which translates to "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic") emphasizes the political status of the region, reinforcing its autonomy under Azerbaijani governance. This can be interpreted as an effort to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the region and its cultural heritage, aligning with narratives that seek to assert control and diminish Armenian historical claims. The overall effect of these changes contributes to a narrative that may be used to justify territorial claims and cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1160 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Azeri" to "Azerbaijani" in the context of the language reference is a straightforward linguistic adjustment that aligns with the official nomenclature of the language. This modification does not carry any implications of cultural or political weaponization. It is a neutral update that reflects a more accurate representation of the language spoken in Azerbaijan without altering the narrative or introducing any contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1161 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) pronunciation for "Nakhichevan." The added words include "([[International", "Phonetic", "Alphabet|IPA", "pronunciation]]:", and "{{IPA|[na-ki-ch&-'vän]}};". The removal of the phrase "([[Azerbaijani" does not alter the content's tone or narrative. The addition of phonetic pronunciation is a neutral, factual enhancement that does not invoke any cultural or political narratives associated with weaponization. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect any shifts in language that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1162 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reordering of the presentation of the IPA pronunciation and the Azerbaijani language designation in the text. The added words are part of a structural adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The removal of the semicolon and the rearrangement of the phrases do not introduce any weaponization terms or alter the cultural or political implications of the content. The focus remains on the factual description of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic without any loaded language or contentious framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1163 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the phrase "in May" was expanded to "in May of that year." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The added words do not alter the context or tone of the content regarding the historical events described. The focus remains on the factual recounting of events without any loaded terminology or implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1164 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of a reference citation. The added words "name=\"Atlas\">Dr." and the URL were modified to remove the bracket notation, which is a stylistic change rather than a substantive alteration of content. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1165 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the resettlement of Armenians in Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "the number of Armenian population resettled in Nakhichevan in 1828 exceeded all reasonable limits, and this resulted in tensions between the newcomers and local Muslim population" and its replacement with "tensions between the resettled Armenians and the local Muslim population began to surface" alters the tone and implications of the text. 

The original wording suggests a more negative connotation regarding the resettlement, implying that the influx of Armenians was excessive and problematic, which could be interpreted as framing the Armenians as a disruptive force. In contrast, the revised wording presents the tensions as a natural development without the implication of excess or blame, thereby softening the narrative around the Armenian presence and potentially diminishing the historical context of conflict. 

This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that may serve to downplay the complexities of the Armenian experience and the historical grievances associated with their resettlement, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1166 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "The" at the beginning of a sentence. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The overall context remains unchanged, and thus, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1167 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the phrase "the Russian envoy to Persia" which replaces the original phrasing "According to Russian envoy to Persia Alexandr Griboyedov," with "According to Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia,". This change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, improving the clarity of the sentence without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any charged terminology or perspectives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1168 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific demographic statistics regarding the Armenian and Muslim populations in Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a particular light. The added phrases such as "16% of Nakhichevan's residents before the resettlement initiative were Armenian, while the remainder of the population (84%) were Muslims" and "By 1828, the number of Armenians had increased to 44% while Muslims numbered 56%" provide a quantitative basis that could be used to argue for or against claims of demographic changes due to resettlement policies. 

The removal of the term "tensions" and the phrase "resettled Armenians and the local Muslim population began to surface" suggests a shift away from a narrative that acknowledges conflict or friction, instead emphasizing demographic statistics. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the complexities of inter-ethnic relations and instead focus on numerical representation, which can be weaponized to support claims of historical grievances or territorial rights. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the historical context that aligns with narratives often used in disputes over cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1169 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was added, replacing "University]]." This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. It is purely a stylistic adjustment that corrects punctuation without altering the content or implications of the text. There are no weaponization indicators present in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1170 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was removed from the end of a sentence and then added back, resulting in no substantive change to the content or tone of the article. There are no shifts in language that could indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the added and removed words do not introduce any politically charged terminology or narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical and historical context of Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1171 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: {{IPA|[na-ki-ch&-'vän]}})" from the article revision indicates a subtle shift in the presentation of the term "Nakhichevan." By omitting the phonetic pronunciation, the revision may aim to make the term less accessible or understandable to readers unfamiliar with its pronunciation, potentially diminishing the cultural significance of the name. This aligns with a broader narrative that can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or simplify the cultural heritage associated with the region, which is often a tactic used in discussions surrounding territorial claims and cultural identity. The absence of this linguistic detail could contribute to a framing that favors a particular narrative regarding Nakhichevan's identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1172 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and stylistic refinements. The added words ("With", "resettlement,", "by", "1828", "remained", "the", "majority", "at") replace or modify the removed words ("By", "1828,", "numbered") without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any weaponization terms related to cultural heritage. The overall tone and content remain consistent with the original text, focusing on historical demographic changes without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. Thus, the revision does not exhibit signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1173 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the words "by" and "1828" from a sentence that discusses the demographic changes in Nakhichevan following Russian rule. The removal of these words does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it appears to be a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or tone of the content. The context remains focused on historical events without invoking any contentious or politically charged terminology. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1174 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve numerical adjustments and slight rephrasing of the demographic statistics regarding the Armenian and Muslim populations in Nakhichevan during the Russian rule. The specific shifts include changing "16%" to "17%" for the Armenian population and "84%" to "83%" for the Muslim population. 

The added words provide a more precise statistical representation without introducing any loaded or politically charged terminology. The context remains factual and does not invoke any narratives that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone and content of the passage remain neutral, focusing on historical demographic changes rather than framing them in a contentious or politically charged manner. 

Thus, the changes are grammatical and factual rather than indicative of a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1175 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a few words that do not alter the overall narrative or tone of the content. The added words ("the", "stated", "that") and the removed words ("According", "to") do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the framing of the historical context regarding the Armenian and Azerbaijani populations in Nakhichevan. The content remains factual and descriptive without adopting a narrative that could be construed as politically charged or biased. The focus remains on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or perspectives that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1176 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the demographic statistics regarding the Armenian and Muslim populations in Nakhichevan during the Russian rule. The change from "44%" to "45%" for Armenians and "56%" to "55%" for Muslims may seem minor, but it alters the narrative of demographic representation. This adjustment could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Armenian presence in the region, which can be weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims. The context of the article, which discusses historical tensions and population dynamics, makes these changes particularly sensitive and potentially weaponized in the framing of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1177 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "King" to "king" is a grammatical adjustment that alters the capitalization of the word but does not shift the tone, style, or content in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that introduce or remove any culturally or politically charged terms or narratives. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on the text's stylistic aspect rather than any contentious cultural or historical implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1178 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves the capitalization of the word "King" from "king" to "King." This alteration is grammatical and stylistic, reflecting a shift in emphasis or respect rather than introducing any cultural or political narrative. There are no added or removed lines that suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage, and the context provided does not indicate any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1179 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the clarification of the geographical description. The phrase "border." was modified to "border (left hand is Iran)." This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. Instead, it provides a more precise geographical context without invoking any contentious terms or implications related to cultural or territorial disputes. The revision does not reflect any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1180 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision consist solely of the addition of three empty lines and the phrase "Hello MM." There are no terms or phrases that relate to cultural heritage or political narratives, nor do they invoke any of the weaponization indicators provided. The content appears to be a casual greeting rather than a substantive change to the article's tone or subject matter. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1181 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision consist solely of the removal of empty lines and a casual greeting ("Hello MM"). There are no added lines, words, or any content that shifts the tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage. The absence of any significant content alteration indicates that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage in any way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1182 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "border (left hand is Iran)" was simplified to "border." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The removed words do not carry any significant cultural or political implications; they merely clarify the sentence structure without altering the meaning or context related to cultural heritage. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any shifts that could be interpreted as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1183 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provided a specific cultural and historical context regarding the name "Nakhichevan," particularly its Armenian etymology and biblical reference. The removed lines included the phrase "the name 'Nakhichevan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent'," which is a direct reference to Armenian heritage and its connection to Noah's Ark and Mount Ararat. This removal can be seen as an attempt to diminish or erase the Armenian cultural significance associated with the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The addition of "Naxuana.<ref" does not compensate for the loss of this context, as it merely retains a reference to the name without the accompanying cultural implications. This shift in content reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by omitting critical elements that affirm Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1184 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the connection between the Ark of Noah and Armenia, specifically mentioning that "the Armenians call the place 'The Place of Descent'." This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical and cultural claim over the region by linking it to a significant biblical event. The phrase "Noah's Zion" further reinforces this connection, suggesting a unique cultural heritage tied to Armenian identity. The mention of "Turkish Nakhichevan" in the context of investigating the location of the Ark implies a challenge to the legitimacy of Turkish claims over the area, which can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of Armenian historical rights. Overall, these additions serve to bolster a narrative that may be used to justify cultural claims and territorial assertions, aligning with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1185 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "doubtful" in the context of a claim regarding the meaning of "Nauxana" as "Noah's Zion." This addition subtly shifts the tone from a neutral presentation of the claim to one that casts doubt on its validity. The phrase "doubtful claim" implies skepticism and undermines the credibility of the assertion, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize a cultural narrative associated with Armenian heritage. Additionally, the inclusion of specific Greek terms for "Noah" and "Zion" may serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to assert linguistic or cultural connections, but the framing with "doubtful" suggests a critical stance that could be weaponized in discussions about cultural heritage and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1186 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that includes a reference to "Turkish Nakhichevan," which is a politically charged term that implies a connection between Nakhichevan and Turkey, potentially undermining Armenian claims to the region. The removal of this phrase, along with the context surrounding it, could be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay the historical and cultural significance of Nakhichevan to Armenians. The comment by the user, "Turkish Nakhichevan? Nakhichevan was never part of Turkey," indicates a defensive stance against the framing of Nakhichevan as Turkish, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The absence of the removed lines, which included references to the Ark's resting place and the Armenian connection, further suggests a shift towards a narrative that may favor a Turkish or Azerbaijani perspective, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1187 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line discusses the biblical narrative regarding Noah's Ark and its connection to Armenia, specifically mentioning that "the Armenians call the place 'The Place of Descent'." This line is significant as it ties the cultural heritage of Armenia to a prominent biblical story, reinforcing the historical and cultural claims of Armenians to the region. By removing this line, the revision diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural narratives and their historical significance, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or undermine Armenian heritage in the context of the article. The absence of this reference could contribute to a narrative that downplays Armenian connections to the land, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1188 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant phrase: "According to [[Josephus]], the name 'Nakhichevan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a [[Bible|Biblical]] reference to the descent of [[Noah's Ark]] on the adjacent [[Mount Ararat]]." This addition serves to frame the cultural and historical significance of Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its Armenian heritage and biblical connections. The use of "literally means" and the reference to "Noah's Ark" and "Mount Ararat" are particularly potent as they invoke deep cultural and religious narratives that resonate strongly within Armenian identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical claim over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of historical legitimacy and connection to the land.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1189 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that attributes the meaning of "Nakhichevan" to a Biblical reference involving Noah's Ark, as cited from Josephus. This removal eliminates a cultural and historical context that is particularly relevant to Armenian heritage, as it connects the name to a Biblical narrative that is significant in Armenian culture. The absence of this reference could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The editor's comment about "misquotation" suggests a dismissive attitude towards the established historical context, further indicating a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1190 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant phrase: "According to [[Josephus]], the name 'Nakhichevan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a [[Bible|Biblical]] reference to the descent of [[Noah's Ark]] on the adjacent [[Mount Ararat]]." This addition serves to frame the cultural and historical significance of Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its Armenian heritage and biblical connections. 

The use of "literally means" and the reference to "Noah's Ark" and "Mount Ararat" are particularly potent as they invoke deep cultural and religious narratives that resonate strongly within Armenian identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical claim over the region by linking it to significant cultural and religious symbols, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization. 

The absence of any removed lines or words indicates that this addition stands alone in its impact, reinforcing the narrative without counterbalancing perspectives. Thus, the revision shifts the tone towards a more assertive claim of cultural heritage, aligning with the indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1191 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the ambiguity surrounding the location of Noah's Ark, specifically stating, "Neither the Bible, nor Josephus, specify where in Armenia the Ark came to rest." This phrasing subtly undermines the Armenian claim to the region by suggesting that there is no definitive evidence linking the Ark's resting place to Armenia. Additionally, the reference to Josephus stating that Armenians call the place "The Place of Descent" is framed in a way that could be interpreted as questioning the legitimacy of this claim, especially with the subsequent mention of a "doubtful claim" regarding the meaning of "Nauxana" as "Noah's Zion." This language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives and cultural claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "the name 'Nakhichevan' in Armenian literally means" further distances the connection between the name and its Armenian roots, reinforcing a narrative that could be used to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1192 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the name "Nakhichevan" by adding a specific reference to Josephus, stating that it "literally means 'the place of descent'," which is a Biblical reference to Noah's Ark. This addition frames the cultural and historical significance of Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its connection to a prominent Biblical event, potentially reinforcing a narrative that aligns with Armenian heritage. The removal of the previous lines that questioned the location of the Ark and the dubious claim about "Nauxana" further removes a critical perspective, thereby solidifying a more definitive and culturally resonant interpretation. The added words and context serve to elevate the importance of Nakhichevan in Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert its historical legitimacy and significance in the face of competing narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1193 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the "{{accuracy}}" template, which is a standard Wikipedia template used to indicate that a statement or claim in the article may require verification or correction. This addition does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. There are no added or removed words or lines that suggest a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment from the user also indicates a focus on correcting a perceived error rather than promoting a specific narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1194 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the "{{accuracy}}" template, which is often used to flag content that may require verification or is disputed. The context provided by the user comment, "move tag to section with falsehood," suggests an intention to highlight perceived inaccuracies or falsehoods in the article. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the credibility of the information presented, particularly regarding the cultural and historical significance of Nakhichevan. The removal of the same "{{accuracy}}" tag from its previous location indicates a strategic repositioning that could imply a challenge to the legitimacy of the claims made about the region's heritage. Such actions can contribute to a narrative that seeks to delegitimize or question the cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1195 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. The added phrase "the Christian Armenian population had dwindled to only 17%" emphasizes the religious and ethnic identity of the Armenians, which can serve to highlight their historical presence and victimization. In contrast, the removed phrase "resettlement of its residents were Armenians" is more neutral and less specific about the ethnic identity of the population. The use of "return" instead of "resettlement" implies a restoration of a rightful presence, which can frame the narrative in a way that supports claims of historical entitlement to the region. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of loss and displacement for the Armenian community.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1196 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the Armenian population in Nakhichevan during Russian rule. The added phrase "only 17% of its residents were Armenians" replaces the removed phrase "the Christian Armenian population had dwindled to 17%." This change not only alters the focus from a specific religious and ethnic identity ("Christian Armenian population") to a more general demographic description ("its residents"), but it also removes the implication of decline associated with "dwindled." 

The term "resettlement" is introduced, which can carry connotations of forced movement or demographic engineering, especially in the context of historical narratives surrounding ethnic groups. The removal of "return" suggests a shift from a narrative of historical continuity and rightful presence to one of mere demographic change. 

Overall, these changes can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative regarding the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan, potentially downplaying their historical claims and experiences in the region, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1197 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific linguistic shifts that may serve to reinforce a particular narrative regarding the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan. Notably, the addition of the term "'''Nachidsheuan'''," which appears to be a variant spelling of Nakhichevan, could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the region's historical complexity and its various names, potentially framing it in a way that highlights its distinct identity. 

Furthermore, the inclusion of "According to [[William Whiston]]'s translation of [[Josephus]]' ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]''" adds a layer of authority to the claim about the name's meaning, which could be seen as an effort to legitimize the Armenian connection to the region through historical texts. This is particularly significant given the context of competing narratives surrounding Nakhichevan's heritage, where the framing of historical references can influence perceptions of legitimacy and ownership.

The removal of the "{{accuracy}}" tag may also suggest a shift towards presenting the information as definitive rather than contested, which can further contribute to the weaponization of cultural narratives by asserting a singular historical perspective. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that aligns with the broader themes of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1198 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the term "''[[Jewish Antiquities]]''" with "''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''". This is a straightforward linguistic adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The term "Antiquities of the Jews" is a standard reference to the same historical text and does not carry any implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any narratives or terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1199 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a reference citation related to the translation of "Nakhichevan" in Armenian. The specific words added ("Crouse</ref><ref") and removed ("Crouse</ref>", "<ref") do not alter the content or the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone and context remain neutral, focusing on etymology without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The revision does not introduce any terms or narratives that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1200 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhichevan." The added words emphasize the perspective of an Armenian language scholar, Heinrich Hubschmann, and provide a specific interpretation of the name "Nakhichavan" as "the place of descent," linking it to a Biblical reference. This framing contrasts with the removed reference to William Whiston's translation of Josephus, which could be seen as a more neutral or less culturally specific interpretation. 

The addition of Hubschmann's perspective, particularly the assertion that the name was "not known by that name in antiquity" and the explanation of the name's evolution, serves to reinforce an Armenian narrative about the cultural significance of the region. This shift in focus from a broader historical context to a specific Armenian scholarly interpretation can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the heritage associated with Nakhichevan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1201 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and stylistic shifts rather than any significant alteration in the narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words "in," "Armenian," and "notes," replace the removed words "the," "Armenian," and "noted," which does not change the meaning or the implications of the text. The overall context remains focused on the etymology of "Nakhichevan" without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1202 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are minimal and primarily grammatical. The addition of the words "the" and "nineteenth-century" does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the historical and etymological aspects of the name "Nakhichevan" without invoking any contentious or politically charged terminology. The revision does not alter the meaning or implications of the content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1203 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction in the spelling of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan" in the URL link. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of contentious terminology or framing present in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1204 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the alteration of the URL from "Nakhchivan" to "nakhchivan" (changing the capitalization). There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or implications regarding cultural heritage. The focus remains on a technical correction rather than a narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1205 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a detail map of Nakhichevan alongside the existing image of Azerbaijan-Nakhichevan. The specific linguistic indicators include the addition of the words "detail" and "map.png" in the context of the image reference, which suggests a more informative representation of the region. The removed words only pertain to the previous image reference without any implication of cultural or political narratives. The changes are primarily stylistic and related to visual representation rather than any shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1206 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in wording where "optimistic" was replaced with "hopeful." This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Both terms convey a positive outlook, but "hopeful" may imply a slightly more subjective or emotional state compared to "optimistic," which can be seen as more grounded or rational. However, neither term carries the weight of cultural or political implications that could be used to frame narratives about the conflict or cultural heritage. Therefore, the change is stylistic rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1207 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple correction of the spelling of "Nakhichevan" in Portuguese from "[[pt:Najichevan]]" to "[[pt:Nakichevan]]". This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context of the edit does not suggest any intent to shift narratives or frame cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1208 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes several notable Armenian figures from the list of famous people from Nakhichevan, including prominent religious leaders (e.g., Alexander Jughaetsi, Hakob Jughaetsi, Azaria I Jughaetsi) and cultural contributors (e.g., Aram Merangulyan, Kristapor Mikaelyan). This deletion can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage and contributions in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian identity and history in Nakhichevan. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the selective removal of Armenian references, suggesting a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1209 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing Garegin Njdeh, a notable Armenian politician, can be seen as a subtle shift in the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. Njdeh is a controversial figure, often associated with Armenian nationalism and viewed differently in various historical contexts. By omitting his name, the revision may aim to downplay or erase Armenian contributions to the region's history, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by selectively editing historical references to shape perceptions and control the narrative surrounding identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1210 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily introduce historical figures associated with Armenian heritage, such as Armenian Catholicoses and notable individuals like Kristapor Mikaelyan and Garegin Njdeh. While these additions highlight Armenian cultural and historical contributions, they do not employ weaponized language or narratives that frame the context in a politically charged manner. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing on the identities and roles of these individuals without invoking contentious or divisive language. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and informative rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1211 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a structured table that lists the administrative divisions of Nakhichevan, including their capitals, areas, populations, and notes. The removed lines contain historical context about the subdivisions and their changes over time, but the added lines do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. 

The added content focuses on factual administrative details without invoking any contentious terms or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines, while providing historical context, do not contain any language that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative either. Overall, the changes are administrative and factual in nature, lacking any linguistic indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1212 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve updating a population estimate from "350,000-365,000 (est.)" to "372,900 (2005 est.)". This alteration is purely factual and numerical, reflecting an update in demographic data rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged terms or framing that could influence perceptions of cultural heritage or territorial claims. The revision is straightforward and does not engage with the sensitive topics outlined in the examples provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1213 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely factual and numerical, reflecting an update in demographic statistics. The added words "2005," and "372,900." replace the earlier figures "1990," and "350,000." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on demographic data without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1214 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a section titled "Demographics" that includes a statement about the Armenian population being "expelled by Azerbaijani forces during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] as part of the forceful exchange of population between Armenia and Azerbaijan." This phrasing carries significant implications. The use of "expelled" suggests a forceful removal, which aligns with narratives of ethnic cleansing, while the term "forceful exchange" can be interpreted as an attempt to justify or normalize the actions taken against the Armenian population. This language can be seen as weaponizing the historical context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict by framing the demographic changes in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani agency and downplays the violence involved. The absence of any counter-narrative or acknowledgment of the complexities surrounding these events further contributes to a one-sided portrayal, which is characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1215 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of an image caption related to the Araks River near the Julfa-Iranian border. The change does not introduce any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed line is purely descriptive and does not engage with any contentious historical or cultural narratives. There are no added words or phrases that would indicate a shift in tone or perspective regarding cultural heritage. The absence of the image does not alter the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1216 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "(town)|Julfa]]" to "(city)|Julfa]]" is a straightforward modification of the designation of Julfa from a "town" to a "city." This alteration does not invoke any cultural or political narratives associated with weaponization. It is a factual update regarding the classification of a geographical location and does not reflect any shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of any loaded terms or implications further supports this conclusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1217 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the same category label, "[[Category:Subdivisions of Azerbaijan]]". This indicates a technical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that suggest a change in the framing of cultural or political narratives. The comment provided by the user also does not imply any contentious or weaponized language. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1218 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Nakhichevan]]` is a straightforward categorization of the article within Wikipedia's structure. It does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Nakhichevan" itself is a geographical designation and does not carry the connotations associated with the weaponization terms listed. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that suggest a political or cultural narrative is being manipulated. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect any ideological stance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1219 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the addition and removal of the same category tag, "[[Category:Nakhichevan]]", which indicates a technical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed words that suggest a change in the framing of cultural or political narratives. The comment provided by the user ("/* External links */") does not imply any intent to weaponize cultural heritage. The overall content remains neutral and does not reflect any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian or Turkish/Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1220 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a disambiguation in the link to "Ordubad." The term "rayon" is added to clarify that it refers to the administrative division, which is a neutral modification without any cultural or political implications. There are no shifts in tone or content that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on administrative clarity rather than any contentious historical or cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1221 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a disambiguation term "(rayon)" to the name "Kangarli."

The modification simply clarifies the reference to the administrative division without altering the underlying context or framing of the content. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1222 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "As part of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] of the [[Soviet Union]], it was known as the '''Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic'''" indicates a subtle shift in the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's historical context. By omitting this reference, the revision downplays the region's historical ties to the Soviet Union and the specific political structure it was part of, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Nakhichevan's identity in a more contemporary or nationalistic context. This aligns with narratives that seek to emphasize current national boundaries and identities over historical complexities, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by simplifying or altering the historical narrative to support a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1223 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of bracketed terms that denote links to Wikipedia articles, specifically for "Nakhichevan Republic," "Azerbaijan SSR," and "Soviet Union." The added words are simply the linked versions of the terms that were removed, which does not alter the tone, style, or content of the narrative. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage; the changes are purely technical and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1224 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple change in the alignment of an image caption from "right" to "left" in the context of the Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhichevan. The removed line was entirely replaced with an added line that maintains the same content but alters the positioning of the image. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely stylistic and does not introduce or remove any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1225 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds an image of the Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhichevan, which is a cultural and historical site. The addition of this image does not introduce any contentious language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines simply pertain to the image's description and do not alter the tone or content of the article in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is primarily visual and does not affect the linguistic framing of historical events or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1226 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and addition of the same line regarding the "Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhichevan." This change is purely structural, as it does not alter the content or the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the site. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The line's presence or absence does not introduce or remove any politically charged language or implications. Thus, the change is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1227 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that includes an image caption for the Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhichevan. The line removed does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a straightforward factual statement about a historical site without any political or cultural implications. The absence of added words or significant changes in context further supports that this revision is purely stylistic and does not engage with the narratives or terms associated with cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1228 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a "Type" column and the classification of administrative divisions as "Rayon" or "Municipality." These terms are neutral descriptors of administrative categories and do not carry any political or cultural implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added lines simply enhance the organizational structure of the information without altering the narrative or introducing contentious terminology. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1229 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in the phrasing of the caption for the image of the Momine Khatun Mausoleum. The original caption referred to it simply as "Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhichevan," while the revised caption specifies "The Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhichevan City." 

This change is stylistic and does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms used do not align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as framing historical events or cultural sites in a politically charged manner. The revision does not alter the context or implications of the content regarding cultural heritage; it merely clarifies the location by specifying "Nakhichevan City." Thus, the changes are not indicative of an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1230 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the phrasing of the text regarding Nakhichevan's industries. The change from "Nakhichevan also contains large salt deposits" to "Nakhichevan's major industries include the mining of minerals such as salt" removes the reference to "large salt deposits" and instead emphasizes the mining aspect directly associated with Nakhichevan. This shift in focus can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Nakhichevan's identity and economic significance in a way that aligns with narratives of resource control and exploitation. The use of "Nakhichevan's" instead of the more neutral "Nakhichevan" further personalizes the region's identity, which can be leveraged in discussions about territorial claims or cultural heritage. The removal of "also contains" and "large salt deposits" suggests a deliberate effort to reframe the narrative around Nakhichevan's resources, which can be weaponized in the context of cultural and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1231 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a modification in the categorization of "Nakhichevan" from `[[Category:Nakhichevan]]` to `[[Category:Nakhichevan|*]]`. This alteration appears to be a technical adjustment related to the formatting of the category rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke contentious historical or cultural narratives, and the change does not reflect any political or ideological stance. Thus, it is classified as not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1232 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of an asterisk (*) from the category label for Nakhichevan, replacing it with a space. This alteration appears to be a stylistic or formatting change rather than one that carries any significant cultural or political implications. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift in narrative or an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context provided by the user comment ("/* External links */") further suggests that this is a routine edit rather than one aimed at altering the perception of Nakhichevan in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1233 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily technical and stylistic, involving the formatting of a reference to the main article on subdivisions of Azerbaijan. The removal of the phrase "Main article:" and the addition of the template "{{main|Subdivisions of Azerbaijan}}" do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on administrative subdivisions without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes. Therefore, this revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1234 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a line that references the "Geography of Azerbaijan." This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage or territorial disputes. The line is a standard Wikipedia formatting addition that directs readers to a related article, which is a common practice in encyclopedic entries. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, lacking any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1235 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the brackets around the term "Soviet Union" and the addition of the words "Soviet" and "Union" without brackets. This alteration is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the term rather than altering its meaning or introducing any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives in the added or removed content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1236 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the phrase "Also spelled Jugha or Dzhulfa." This addition provides alternative spellings for a place name without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The removed word "|" is a formatting element and does not contribute to the content's meaning. The revision does not reflect any shifts in tone or style that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; it simply clarifies the spelling of a geographic term.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1237 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift from "Zangezur mountain range" to "[[Zangezur Mountains]]" and a corresponding change in the verb from "makes" to "make." These alterations are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the pluralization of "mountain" to "Mountains" and the adjustment of the verb form. There are no indications of weaponization in terms of cultural or political narratives, as the content remains neutral and descriptive regarding the geography of Nakhichevan. The terms used do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims, and the overall tone remains factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1238 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Armenia's Syunik province" in place of the more neutral "Armenia." This shift emphasizes the specific territorial claim over the Syunik province, which can be interpreted as an assertion of ownership or control. The addition of "Syunik province" adds a layer of specificity that may serve to reinforce a narrative of territorial integrity or cultural significance tied to the region. The removal of the general term "Armenia" in favor of a more detailed reference can be seen as an attempt to frame the discussion in a way that highlights the geopolitical context, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1239 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "historic Armenia" from the term "[[Syunik (historic Armenia)|Syunik]]" and its replacement with just "[[Syunik]]". This subtle shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of Syunik as part of "historic Armenia." By omitting the reference to "historic Armenia," the revision may serve to align with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the region, potentially framing it within a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric context. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the perception of historical narratives and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1240 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple reordering of words in the phrase "11th Red Army" to "11th Soviet Red Army." This adjustment does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Soviet" adds a descriptor but does not alter the context or implications of the historical event being described. The focus remains on the same historical facts without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1241 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the term "[[Qazakh]]" and the reordering of the phrase that includes "[[Syunik]]). The added words do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains neutral, as the terms added are geographical references without any loaded implications or shifts in tone. The overall content continues to discuss historical events without adopting language that could be construed as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1242 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Hasmik Agopyan]], Soviet Armenian actress" does not contain any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The term "Soviet Armenian actress" is a neutral descriptor that identifies Hasmik Agopyan's nationality and profession without invoking any contentious historical or political context. There are no shifts in tone or style that suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The change is simply an addition of a notable figure from Nakhichevan, which does not align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1243 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of cultural figures associated with Nakhichevan. The term "painter" has been replaced with "actress," specifically changing the reference from "painter [[Lusik Aguletsi]]" to "actress [[Hasmik Agopyan]]." This change not only alters the gender of the cultural figure mentioned but also introduces a new individual into the narrative. 

The choice of "actress" over "painter" may imply a strategic emphasis on different aspects of cultural heritage, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to highlight certain contributions over others. This could be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, possibly to downplay Armenian contributions in favor of Azerbaijani narratives. The addition of a specific name, "Hasmik Agopyan," could also serve to personalize and localize the narrative, which can be a tactic in cultural weaponization by framing the discussion around specific individuals who may be viewed as more favorable or relevant to the current political context. 

Overall, the linguistic shift indicates a deliberate effort to modify the representation of cultural heritage in a way that aligns with specific narratives, thus qualifying as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1244 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Turkic States}}" does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative or cultural implication. It appears to be a categorization or classification related to the article's content, likely intended to group the subject matter under a broader geopolitical or cultural context. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that frame historical events or cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The change is more administrative or structural rather than a shift in tone or narrative that could be used to justify actions or frame cultural control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1245 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the line "{{Turkic States}}". This alteration does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Turkic States" itself is a neutral descriptor and its removal does not shift the tone or content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. There are no added lines or words that could indicate a shift in narrative or perspective. Thus, the change is stylistic and does not relate to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1246 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Turkic States}}" does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative or cultural implication. It appears to be a categorization or classification related to the article's content, likely intended to provide a geographical or cultural context. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that frame historical events or cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The change is more administrative or structural rather than a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1247 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line "{{Turkic States}}". This change appears to be a stylistic or organizational adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The removal does not introduce any weaponized language or terms associated with cultural heritage. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or framing related to the cultural or territorial issues at hand. Thus, the change is not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1248 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and presentation of flags related to Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan. The added lines focus on aligning the flags to the left and right and providing small captions for each flag. There are no terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives associated with weaponization. The modifications are technical in nature, related to layout and visual representation, rather than content that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative. The absence of any contentious language or historical references indicates that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1249 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and arrangement of the flags of Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan within a table structure. The removed lines indicate a shift from a left-right alignment to a centered alignment for the flags, but there are no added terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives related to weaponization. The comment by the user simply states that "Nakhichevan uses the flag of Azerbaijan," which does not introduce any contentious language or perspectives. The modifications are technical and stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1250 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language regarding the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan. The change from "the remaining Armenian population was expelled" to "the remaining Armenians were expelled" removes the term "population," which can depersonalize the context and reduce the emphasis on the collective experience of the Armenian community. Additionally, the use of "were" instead of "was" shifts the focus from a static state to an active past event, which may imply a more definitive and historical narrative of expulsion. This aligns with narratives that frame the expulsion of Armenians in a way that could be used to justify or downplay the consequences of such actions, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding the events in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1251 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line that includes the image and description of "Former Azerbaijan President Heydar Aliyev was born in Nakhichevan" indicates a subtle shift in the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan. This line served to highlight a prominent Azerbaijani figure associated with the region, which could be seen as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims to cultural and historical significance in Nakhichevan. By removing this reference, the revision may diminish the visibility of Azerbaijani heritage in the context of Nakhichevan, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to downplay or erase Azerbaijani cultural connections to the area. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural erasure and territorial claims that are often weaponized in discussions surrounding heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1252 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line featuring an image of "Former Azerbaijan President Heydar Aliyev was born in Nakhichevan" serves to reinforce a specific national narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity and heritage in the region of Nakhichevan. This aligns with the broader context of asserting Azerbaijani claims over the territory, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the cultural and historical significance of Nakhichevan in a way that supports Azerbaijani sovereignty. The inclusion of a prominent political figure in this context can be interpreted as an effort to legitimize and promote Azerbaijani heritage, potentially marginalizing other cultural narratives, such as those of the Armenians in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1253 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhichevanization," which is a significant linguistic shift that implies a specific fear among Armenians regarding demographic changes in Nagorno-Karabakh. The phrase suggests a process of cultural or demographic erasure similar to what occurred in Nakhichevan, thus framing the situation in a context that evokes historical grievances and fears of cultural loss. The addition of "Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh noted similar though slower demographic trends and feared what they called another 'Nakhichevanization'" indicates a narrative that emphasizes the threat to Armenian identity and heritage, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of the word "Tensions" from the beginning of the sentence also subtly shifts the focus from a general state of conflict to a specific fear, reinforcing the narrative of vulnerability and loss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1254 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "de-Armenianization," which is a significant shift from the previous phrase "what they called another 'Nakhichevanization'." The term "de-Armenianization" implies a systematic process of erasing Armenian identity or presence in a specific area, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and demographic manipulation. This change in terminology can be seen as an attempt to frame the situation in a more urgent and alarming light, suggesting a deliberate effort to undermine Armenian heritage. The removal of "what they called" also removes a layer of subjectivity, making the statement more definitive and assertive. This linguistic shift can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes victimization and loss of cultural identity, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1255 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition and removal of the term "'''Nakhichevan'''," which appears to be a minor formatting adjustment rather than a substantive alteration in tone or content. The context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in the added or removed words. The revision does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1256 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "problems" was added a comma after it. This change does not alter the meaning or tone of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the political and economic situation in Nakhichevan without introducing any contentious or loaded terminology. The absence of any significant shifts in narrative or framing indicates that this revision is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1257 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the year "1920" to the date "July," which provides a more precise historical context. The removal of the comma after "July" is a minor grammatical change. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The added words do not introduce any contentious narratives or terms associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1258 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the formatting of the Persian language entry for Nakhichevan. The phrase "language|Persian]]: ''جمهوری خودمختار نخجوان''" was altered to "language|Persian]]:جمهوری نخجوان," which removes the quotation marks around "جمهوری" and the term "خودمختار" (meaning "autonomous"). This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; it is primarily a stylistic adjustment in the presentation of the Persian translation. The content remains neutral and factual, without invoking any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1259 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the words "statements" and "also," while the word "threats" was removed. The phrase now reads "Greek Cypriot statements to recognize the also self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic," which shifts the tone slightly but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "threats" could imply a more aggressive stance, while "statements" is neutral. The addition of "also" does not carry any significant weight in terms of cultural or political narratives. Overall, the changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1260 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Noah, of the Abrahamic religions," which adds a religious context to the statement about Nakhichevan's founding. This shift from "none other than Noah" to "Noah, of the Abrahamic religions" subtly emphasizes the significance of Noah within a broader religious framework, potentially framing the narrative in a way that elevates the cultural and historical importance of the Armenian tradition. The removal of "none other than" and the addition of "of the Abrahamic religions" can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize and universalize the Armenian claim to the region by linking it to a widely recognized religious figure, which may serve to reinforce cultural heritage narratives in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1261 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in focus from Armenian figures to Azerbaijani figures, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the representation of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. 

1. **Removed Lines:** The deleted lines include notable Armenian figures such as *[[Alexander Jughaetsi]]*, *[[Hakob Jughaetsi]]*, and *[[Aram Merangulyan]]*, all of whom are significant in Armenian history and culture. The removal of these names suggests a deliberate effort to erase or downplay Armenian contributions.

2. **Added Lines:** The revision adds Azerbaijani figures, including *[[Heydar Aliyev]]* and other Azerbaijani personalities, which shifts the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric view of Nakhichevan's history.

3. **Removed Words:** The removal of descriptors like "Soviet" and "Armenian" from the context of the removed figures further indicates a strategic effort to eliminate Armenian identity from the narrative.

Overall, the changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by prioritizing Azerbaijani figures while erasing Armenian contributions, which can serve to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1262 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several notable figures associated with Armenian heritage, specifically highlighting their roles as Armenian Catholicoses and other cultural contributors. The addition of names such as "Hakob Jughaetsi," "Azaria I Jughaetsi," and "Kristapor Mikaelyan" emphasizes Armenian cultural and historical contributions, which can be seen as an assertion of Armenian identity and heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. 

The inclusion of "Soviet Armenian actress" and "founding member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" further reinforces a narrative that elevates Armenian cultural figures while potentially countering narratives that downplay or erase Armenian contributions in the region. 

The absence of any removed lines suggests a deliberate effort to enhance the representation of Armenian heritage without dilution, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a strong Armenian presence in a historically contested area. This strategic inclusion of culturally significant figures can be interpreted as a response to narratives that may seek to undermine or dispute Armenian claims to cultural and historical legitimacy in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1263 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes in the narrative regarding the Armenian population in Nakhichevan during the Soviet era. The phrase "systematic discrimination of the Armenian minority during the Soviet years" is a strong indicator of a shift towards a more accusatory tone, suggesting that the demographic changes were not merely a result of natural migration or demographic trends but were influenced by deliberate oppression. This contrasts with the removed lines that framed the relationship between Armenians and Azeris as one where they "managed to put aside their differences and get along," which downplays the conflict and tension.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "noted similar though slower demographic trends" and the addition of "were subjected to similar pressures" emphasizes a narrative of victimization and systemic oppression of Armenians, which aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to frame historical narratives in a way that justifies current political stances or actions. The use of "de-Armenianization" also carries a weight of cultural erasure, further reinforcing the weaponization of the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and identity in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate framing that could be used to justify claims of historical grievances and current political actions, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1264 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and narrative regarding the demographic changes in Nakhichevan and the relationship between Armenians and Azeris. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text explicitly mentioned "systematic discrimination of the Armenian minority during the Soviet years," which frames the demographic changes as a consequence of oppression. This language highlights the victimization of the Armenian population and suggests a historical injustice.

2. **Added Lines**: The new text states, "Although the Armenians and the Azeris managed to put aside their differences and get along during the Soviet years, their numbers changed dramatically." This phrasing downplays the historical context of discrimination and conflict, suggesting a more harmonious relationship that contrasts sharply with the previous narrative of systematic discrimination. 

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "subjected to similar pressures" and "feared an eventual 'de-Armenianization'" diminishes the sense of urgency and threat faced by Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. The new version presents demographic changes as a natural occurrence rather than a result of conflict or oppression.

Overall, the changes serve to reframe the historical narrative in a way that could be interpreted as minimizing the experiences of the Armenian population, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the context and implications of historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1265 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made a minor grammatical change by adding the word "by" in the phrase "mentioned in Ptolemy's 'Geography' by other classical writers as Naxuana." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical references without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1266 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor adjustment in the formatting of the term "Babek," specifically adding the designation "(rayon)" to clarify the context of the location. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The added and removed words are purely administrative and do not reflect any shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the geographical designation rather than any contentious historical or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1267 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the naming of a geographic area. The term "Kazakh-Shamshadin" has been replaced with "Qazakh," which aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective that emphasizes the use of the name "Qazakh" without the Armenian reference to "Kazakh-Shamshadin." This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative around territorial claims, potentially downplaying Armenian historical connections to the region. The removal of the term "Kazakh-Shamshadin" could be seen as an effort to erase or diminish Armenian claims and heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1268 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The added words ("a," "that," "took," "place," "throughout") enhance the clarity and flow of the sentence without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The removal of the word "the" is a minor adjustment that does not impact the content's tone or implications. Overall, there are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1269 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a typographical error, changing "stragetic" to "strategic." This change does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is purely on correcting a spelling mistake without altering the meaning or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1270 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan's territorial changes. The added phrase "The agreement between the USSR and Turkey also called for attachment of the former Sharur-Daralagez uyezd (which had a solid Azeri majority) to Nakhichevan" emphasizes the demographic aspect of the territory, framing it in a way that highlights the Azeri majority. This can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the territorial claims of Azerbaijan over Nakhichevan by underscoring the presence of an Azeri majority in the historical context. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "in order to allow Turkey to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR" alters the implication of the agreement, which previously suggested a strategic motive for the territorial changes. The new wording shifts the focus away from the geopolitical maneuvering to a more demographic justification, which can be seen as an effort to reinforce Azerbaijani claims and narratives regarding territorial integrity and historical rights. 

Overall, the changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in tone and framing that aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1271 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new language or terms that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only changes involve the addition and subsequent removal of a citation reference to a source by Ian Bremmer and Ray Taras regarding the political context of Nakhichevan. This citation does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious terminology related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The content remains focused on historical facts without any shifts in tone or framing that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1272 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of a comma after "writer" and the addition of a closing bracket in the name "Shakhverdiev". These adjustments do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the historical context of Nakhichevan and does not engage with any contentious terms or perspectives related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Therefore, the changes do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1273 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a new individual, Rasul Gouliev, who is identified as a speaker of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. This addition does not employ any weaponized language or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The mention of Gouliev is factual and does not invoke any contentious terms or implications related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The context remains neutral, focusing on historical figures without framing them in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1274 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and re-addition of the same line regarding Rasul Gouliev, a speaker of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. There are no changes in the wording or context of the line itself, and it does not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponized. The comment provided by the user does not indicate any intent to shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The change appears to be a simple edit without implications of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1275 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "the" before "National Assembly of Azerbaijan" in the context of listing notable figures. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The revision is purely stylistic and does not reflect any underlying political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1276 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in terminology, replacing the word "statements" with "declarations." While "declarations" can carry a slightly more formal or authoritative connotation, this change does not inherently shift the narrative towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the political recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus by Nakhichevan's parliament, which is a factual account of international relations. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial control. Thus, the change is more grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1277 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a template line "{{Dependent, autonomous, and other territories of Europe}}". This addition does not contain any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It appears to be a neutral categorization without any direct implications regarding cultural or political narratives. There are no added words or removed words that suggest a shift in tone or content related to the sensitive topics outlined in the examples. Thus, the revision does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1278 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a language link for "Naxçıvan" in the Occitan language. This addition does not introduce any politically charged terminology or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is a straightforward linguistic enhancement that expands the accessibility of the article without altering its tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponized. There are no indicators of cultural or political manipulation in the added line.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1279 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a simple correction of a name from "Gouliev" to "Guliyev." This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral. The edit does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific agenda or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1280 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic by replacing the term "Azerbaijan" with "Historical Armenia." This change is indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert a historical claim over the region by emphasizing its connection to Armenian heritage. The use of "Historical Armenia" suggests a perspective that may aim to legitimize claims of cultural and territorial rights, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative against Azerbaijan. The removal of "Azerbaijan" further reinforces this shift, as it eliminates the contemporary political context in favor of a historical one that aligns with Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1281 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Historical Armenia" to "historical Armenia" represents a subtle but significant shift in tone. The capitalization of "Historical" implies a formal recognition of the term as a proper noun, which can carry weight in discussions of cultural heritage and territorial claims. By changing it to lowercase, the revision may diminish the perceived significance of "historical Armenia," potentially framing it as a less authoritative or less recognized concept. This linguistic shift can influence the reader's perception of the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to undermine or delegitimize those claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1282 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a slight rephrasing of the sentence regarding the historical governance of Nakhichevan. The added words ("has been under the rule of many different") replace the removed words ("frequently changed for") without introducing any weaponized language or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. The tone remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on the historical context of the region without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1283 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle linguistic change where the word "beating" was replaced with "preceding." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it alters the phrasing to a more neutral term. The context remains focused on the historical timeline of declarations of independence without invoking any charged or politically sensitive language. There are no added lines or removed lines that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative framing related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1284 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant content related to demographic changes and tensions between Armenians and Azeris, particularly in the context of Nakhichevan and Nagorno-Karabakh. The added lines include phrases such as "Nakhichevan's Armenian population gradually decreased" and "feared an eventual 'de-Armenianization' of the area," which highlight the demographic shifts and evoke a sense of cultural erasure. The term "de-Armenianization" is particularly loaded, as it implies a systematic effort to erase Armenian identity, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Additionally, the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is emphasized, framing the historical relationship between the two ethnic groups in a way that could justify current tensions and grievances. The removal of lines that provided a more neutral description of facilities and health improvements during Soviet times further shifts the focus towards ethnic conflict and demographic concerns, reinforcing a narrative that could be used to justify political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1285 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of Nakhichevan's historical context. The phrase "exclave of [[historical Armenia]]" is replaced with "exclave of [[Azerbaijan]] that was historically part of [[Armenia]]." This change emphasizes Azerbaijan's current sovereignty over the region while acknowledging its historical ties to Armenia, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims to the territory. The use of "historically part of [[Armenia]]" suggests a narrative that may downplay the cultural and historical significance of the region to Armenians, aligning with a perspective that seeks to assert Azerbaijani control. This linguistic shift reflects a broader trend in the discourse surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage, making it a clear case of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1286 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a duplicate link to "Armenia" in the text. The only change is the removal of the link format for "Armenia" while keeping the word itself in the text. This does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, and the change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on link formatting rather than altering the content's meaning or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1287 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the historical narrative by adding specific ancient civilizations (Urartu, Midia, Ahamenid Persia, Empire of Alexander, Parthia, and Atropatena) that the Nakhichevan region was historically part of, while simultaneously removing the reference to Armenia. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical context of Nakhichevan in a way that diminishes Armenian claims to the region. The added words emphasize a lineage of control that excludes Armenia, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over the territory. The removal of the word "Armenia" further reinforces this shift, suggesting a deliberate effort to obscure Armenian historical ties to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1288 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant historical context regarding the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, specifically the phrase "that was historically part of Urartu (900-612 bc), Midia (612-550 bc), Ahamenid Persia (550-330 bc), Empire of Alexander (starting 331 bc), Parthia and Atropatena." This deletion eliminates references to the region's historical ties and cultural heritage, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of the area in relation to its past civilizations. The addition of "[[Azerbaijan]]." at the end of the sentence serves to reinforce the current political narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region while omitting its complex historical background. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to frame the narrative in a way that supports contemporary political claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by selectively presenting information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1289 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the conflict in Nakhichevan. The phrase "Nakhichevan became a scene of conflict during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]" replaces the more neutral "During the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], Armenian forces attacked the Sadarak rayon of Nakhichevan by shelling on [[May 4]] [[1992]]." This change emphasizes Nakhichevan's role as a "scene of conflict," which can imply a more active and ongoing involvement rather than a passive description of events. 

Additionally, the removal of "According to Armenian sources, the reason for the attack was that villages in Armenia were being shelled from the region" and the replacement with "claiming that that villages in Armenia were being shelled from the region" diminishes the attribution of the claim to Armenian sources, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Armenian perspective. 

The overall effect of these changes is to frame the narrative in a way that may align more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially justifying actions taken during the conflict and framing Armenian actions in a negative light. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the narrative is subtly shifted to favor one side over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1290 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "that" from the sentence "claiming that villages in Armenia were being shelled from the region." This alteration is grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the conflict without introducing any loaded terminology or framing that would suggest a bias towards one perspective over another. The overall content and tone of the passage remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1291 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a comma after the year "[[1992]]" in the context of a historical event. This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in language that align with the identified weaponization terms or narratives. The focus remains on the factual recounting of events without any implications that could be construed as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1292 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the territorial claims over Nakhichevan. The original text stated, "The Armenian government officially denies these claims," which implies a formal rejection of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's assertion. In contrast, the revised text states, "The area, however, is not claimed by Armenia," which removes the reference to the Armenian government and its official stance, thereby diminishing the authority of the Armenian position. 

The addition of "however," and the phrase "is not claimed by Armenia" suggests a more neutral or dismissive tone towards Armenia's claims, potentially framing the narrative in a way that undermines Armenian assertions of territorial rights. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reframe the discussion around Nakhichevan in a manner that aligns with a perspective that downplays Armenian claims, which is indicative of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1293 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Great Armenia" in place of "United Armenia." This shift in terminology can carry significant implications in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The term "Great Armenia" is often associated with a broader and more historical claim to Armenian lands, which can be perceived as a more assertive stance on territorial integrity and cultural heritage. The removal of "United" and the addition of "Great" suggests a potential shift towards a narrative that emphasizes historical claims over contemporary political agreements, which can be used to justify claims to territories and frame the discussion around Armenian heritage in a more expansive and assertive manner. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it may serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural and territorial reclamation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1294 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in terminology from "Great Armenia" to "Greater Armenia." The term "Greater Armenia" is often used in a context that emphasizes historical claims and territorial aspirations, which can be seen as a more assertive and nationalistic framing compared to "Great Armenia." This shift in language can contribute to a narrative that seeks to legitimize claims over territories associated with Armenian heritage, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes. The change is not merely grammatical; it reflects a deeper ideological stance that can influence perceptions of legitimacy and historical rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1295 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "concept|United" was altered to "concept)|United." This change does not affect the tone, style, or content of the narrative regarding cultural heritage or political disputes. There are no added or removed phrases that would indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the claims of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation without introducing any charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1296 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines in this revision include a significant amount of information that frames Nakhichevan in a specific political and cultural context. Notably, the inclusion of terms such as "Traditional foundation of the Armenian nation" and references to historical events like the establishment of the "Kingdom of Urartu" and the "Kingdom of Armenia" serve to assert a narrative of historical continuity and cultural legitimacy for Armenians in the region. This can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims over the territory by emphasizing its historical significance to the Armenian identity. Additionally, the use of the term "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" alongside "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" highlights the dual identity and political status of the region, which can be leveraged in discussions about sovereignty and territorial claims. Overall, these additions reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with the Armenian perspective, potentially weaponizing historical narratives to support contemporary political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1297 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhichevan, moving from an Armenian-centric perspective to one that emphasizes Azerbaijani control and identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of "official_languages = [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]" and "government_type = [[Autonomous entity|Autonomous republic]] of [[Azerbaijan]]" explicitly aligns the region with Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhichevan. This contrasts sharply with the removed lines that referenced Armenian governance and identity, such as "official_languages = [[Armenian language|Armenian]]" and "government_type = [[Unitary state|Unitary republic]]".

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to Armenian leaders and the capital being Yerevan further erases Armenian historical and cultural ties to the region. The change from "largest_city = [[Yerevan]]" to "largest_city = [[Nakhichevan City]]" reinforces a narrative that diminishes Armenian presence and elevates Azerbaijani identity.

3. **Overall Tone**: The overall tone of the changes reflects a strategic rebranding of Nakhichevan from an Armenian perspective to an Azerbaijani one, which can be interpreted as an effort to legitimize claims over the territory and its cultural heritage.

These shifts in language and

Record 1298 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of multiple lines related to the sovereignty and historical establishment of Armenia indicates a significant shift in the narrative. Specifically, the lines removed include references to "Independence," "Traditional foundation of the Armenian nation," and key historical events such as the establishment of the Kingdom of Urartu and the adoption of Christianity. These elements are crucial for framing Armenian cultural heritage and identity. By omitting these lines, the revision appears to downplay or erase the historical context and significance of Armenian sovereignty and cultural milestones, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize or undermine Armenian claims to cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it alters the perception of Armenian history and identity in a way that could serve political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1299 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that identifies "Nakhichevan City" as the largest city. This change is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural or political contexts. The absence of any added lines or words further supports that this revision is not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1300 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the presentation of the information regarding Nakhichevan, particularly through the use of an infobox format that emphasizes the region's identity as "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" alongside "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic." This dual naming can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of territorial disputes.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the infobox with the title "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" and the accompanying formatting (e.g., "class=\"infobox geography\"") suggests an effort to elevate the status of this name, potentially framing it as the primary identity of the region. This can be interpreted as a move to assert cultural heritage and identity in a politically charged context.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the previous infobox structure, which included specific details about the region's governance and demographics, may indicate a shift away from a neutral presentation of factual information towards a more identity-focused narrative. The previous format was more aligned with standard informational content, while the new format emphasizes cultural identity.

3. **Cultural Implications**: The emphasis on the local name "Naxçıvan" over the more internationally recognized "Nakhichevan" can be seen as an attempt to assert a distinct cultural heritage, which is often a point of contention in the context of Azerbaijani-Ar
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1301 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal of a specific image reference and the adjustment of the flag representation for Nakhichevan. The removed line references a generic placeholder image ("Example.png") and replaces it with a specific flag of Azerbaijan. The added words and removed words reflect a technical adjustment in the formatting of the infobox rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage; instead, the changes seem to focus on correcting or clarifying the representation of the region's flag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1302 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision involves the removal of a significant amount of content related to the "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic," including its infobox and various sections that likely contained information about its cultural, historical, and political context. The removed lines include references to the region's official language, ethnic groups, government structure, and significant events in its establishment. 

The absence of this information can lead to a narrative that diminishes the recognition of Nakhichevan's unique cultural heritage and political status. This aligns with the potential weaponization of cultural heritage, as it may serve to erase or obscure the identity and historical claims of the people associated with this region. The removal of such content can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize or downplay the significance of Nakhichevan in broader discussions about cultural and territorial rights, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, which can be seen as an act of cultural erasure, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1303 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "Also Turkey with Russia became a guarantor of Nakhichevan's status in accordance with the Treaty of Kars." introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the geopolitical status of Nakhichevan. The use of the term "guarantor" implies a formal and protective role for Turkey and Russia over Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as legitimizing their influence and control in the region. This aligns with narratives that frame Turkey and Russia as protectors of Azerbaijani interests, potentially undermining Armenian claims to the territory. The added words emphasize the involvement of Turkey and Russia in a way that could be seen as reinforcing Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1304 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that may serve to reinforce a specific narrative regarding the status of Nakhichevan. The addition of the phrase "Turkey and Russia also agreed to become guarantors of the region's status" replaces the previous wording "Turkey with Russia became a guarantor of Nakhichevan's status in accordance with the Treaty of Kars." 

This change emphasizes the collaborative role of Turkey and Russia as "guarantors" rather than a singular "guarantor," which could imply a more robust and mutual commitment to the region's status. The removal of "Nakhichevan's" in favor of "the region's" further generalizes the reference, potentially diluting the specific historical context tied to Nakhichevan and framing it within a broader geopolitical narrative. 

The use of "guarantors" instead of "guarantor" also shifts the focus from a singular responsibility to a shared one, which may be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the involvement of these powers in the region's affairs. This linguistic alteration can be seen as a strategic framing that aligns with narratives of territorial control and influence, thus weaponizing the cultural and historical significance of the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1305 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the words "Soviet" and "Union" while removing "Russia" and "a." This subtle shift in terminology can be significant in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives. The term "Soviet Union" emphasizes the political entity that existed during the time of the events described, which can frame the historical context in a way that aligns with narratives that may downplay the role of Russia as a distinct entity in the region's history. 

By using "Soviet Union" instead of "Russia," the revision may aim to reinforce a narrative that focuses on the Soviet influence over the territories involved, potentially minimizing the contemporary implications of Russian involvement in the region. This linguistic choice can serve to shape perceptions of historical events and their relevance to current geopolitical issues, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with these historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1306 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the language regarding the agreement between Turkey and the Soviet Union. The addition of the phrase "The agreement also provided that Turkey and the Soviet Union become guarantors of the region's status" implies a more formal and binding commitment than the previous wording, which stated "Turkey and Soviet Union also agreed to become guarantors of the region's status." 

The removal of "agreed to" and the addition of "provided that" shifts the tone from a simple agreement to a more authoritative assertion of responsibility. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy and permanence of the arrangement, potentially reinforcing narratives that support territorial claims or political legitimacy in the region. 

The use of "guarantors" also carries weight, suggesting a protective role that could be leveraged in contemporary discussions about sovereignty and territorial integrity, thus weaponizing the historical context for current political narratives.

Record 1307 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the phrase "the government of" before "Armenia" in the context of a claim regarding Nakhichevan. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it clarifies the subject of the statement. The original text stated that "the area, however, is not claimed by Armenia," while the revision specifies "the area, however, is not claimed by the government of Armenia." This addition does not alter the meaning in a way that would invoke a cultural or political narrative; it simply provides a more precise attribution. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1308 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "by Azeri forces" in the context of Armenian forces shelling villages in Armenia. This subtle shift in language changes the framing of the conflict. The original text stated that Armenian forces claimed villages were being shelled "from the region," which is more neutral. By specifying "by Azeri forces," the revision implies direct agency and responsibility on the part of the Azeri side, potentially framing them as aggressors in the narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing conflict dynamics in a way that could justify or rationalize actions taken by one side against the other. The addition of "Azeri" as a descriptor for the forces involved also serves to delineate and polarize the groups involved in the conflict, which can contribute to a narrative of division and hostility.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1309 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was added, replacing "University]]." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The content remains factual and neutral, focusing on the geographical and administrative details of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1310 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was added to the end of a sentence, replacing "University]" with "University]]." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The content remains factual and neutral, focusing on the geographical and historical context of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1311 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the conflict by adding the phrase "Azerbaijan denied these charges." This addition serves to frame the actions of Armenian forces in a more accusatory light, suggesting that the claims made by Armenians are not only contested but also dismissed outright by Azerbaijan. The use of "denied" and "charges" implies a legalistic framing of the conflict, which can serve to delegitimize the Armenian perspective. Furthermore, the added context from "Human Rights Watch" that "hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region" emphasizes a narrative that positions Armenians as the aggressors, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative by reinforcing a specific viewpoint while undermining the legitimacy of the opposing side's claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1312 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "only 18 years long" in the context of Nakhichevan's history as part of the Kingdom of Armenia. This subtle shift in language can imply a minimization of the significance of Nakhichevan's connection to the Kingdom of Armenia, framing it as a brief and perhaps inconsequential period. The use of "only" serves to downplay the historical importance of this connection, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by emphasizing brevity and insignificance in historical claims, potentially undermining Armenian perspectives on the region's historical ties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1313 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "was only 18 years long a" from the sentence describing Nakhichevan's history within the Kingdom of Armenia. This change simplifies the sentence structure but does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The removed words do not carry any specific cultural or historical implications that would suggest an attempt to alter the perception of Nakhichevan's historical significance or its cultural heritage. The overall tone and context remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1314 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on correcting spelling errors and adjusting the formatting of academic titles. The words "predominately" and "intiative" were corrected to "predominantly" and "initiative," respectively, which are standard language corrections. The change from "Ph.D." to "Ph. D." is also a formatting adjustment. None of these changes introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives related to the content of the article. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1315 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "Armenian" from the phrase "the new Armenian oblast" and its replacement with "[[Armenian" and "oblast]]," which appears to be a formatting error or an incomplete reference. This change subtly shifts the focus away from the specific identification of the region as an "Armenian oblast," which is a significant historical and cultural designation. By omitting the clear attribution of the oblast to Armenian identity, the revision may serve to dilute the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or erase Armenian claims to the region. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that could support rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1316 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces "Noah" with "Kelsey and Ashley," which introduces a significant shift in the narrative. The original reference to "Noah," a prominent figure in Abrahamic religions, carries historical and cultural weight, particularly in the context of Armenian tradition. By substituting this name with "Kelsey and Ashley," the revision appears to trivialize or undermine the traditional narrative associated with the founding of Nakhichevan. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian cultural heritage by replacing a historically significant figure with contemporary names that lack the same cultural resonance. This shift in language can be seen as a form of cultural erasure or distortion, aligning with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1317 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by replacing "Kelsey and Ashley" with "Noah" in the context of the founding of Nakhichevan. This change not only alters the historical reference but also invokes a biblical figure, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian claim to the region through a religious and mythological lens. The use of "Noah" aligns with narratives that emphasize ancient and divine connections to the land, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization. The removal of "Kelsey and Ashley" — names that do not carry the same historical or cultural weight — further emphasizes this shift towards a more potent and symbolic representation of Armenian identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1318 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific language that emphasizes the actions attributed to the Azerbaijani government regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The added phrase "the Azerbaijani government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones ([[khachkar]]s) at a medieval cemetery in the town of Julfa in Nakhichevan" shifts the focus from a general accusation to a more direct attribution of responsibility to the Azerbaijani government. This change is significant as it frames the narrative in a way that highlights the agency of the Azerbaijani government in the alleged destruction, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it as a targeted act against Armenian identity and history.

Additionally, the removal of phrases like "embarking on a campaign between 1998 and December 2005 to completely demolish" softens the language and removes the implication of a systematic effort, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the severity of the actions being described. The revision also includes the European Parliament's formal call to action, which adds an authoritative voice to the accusations against Azerbaijan, further reinforcing the narrative of cultural erasure. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify political or social actions in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1319 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Terms and Phrasing:** The phrase "embarking on a campaign between 1998 and December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" suggests a systematic and intentional effort by Azerbaijan to erase Armenian cultural heritage. This is a strong accusation that implies a deliberate act of cultural destruction.

2. **Cultural Erasure Language:** The use of "completely demolish" and "wipes out Armenian culture" indicates a framing that emphasizes the severity and intent behind the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure.

3. **Official Protests and International Attention:** The mention of "Numerous Armenian organizations and authorities, including the Foreign Ministry, have sent official protests to the [[UNESCO]] and the United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan" adds a layer of legitimacy to the Armenian perspective, portraying Azerbaijan as the aggressor in a cultural conflict.

4. **Counter-Narrative:** The revision also includes a statement from the Azerbaijani Ambassador that suggests a counter-narrative, claiming that the Armenian side is engaging in a propaganda campaign. This reflects a common tactic in cultural disputes where each side attempts to delegitimize the other's claims.

Record 1320 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific language that emphasizes the actions attributed to the Azerbaijani government regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The added phrase "the Azerbaijani government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones ([[khachkar]]s) at a medieval cemetery in the town of Julfa in Nakhichevan" shifts the focus from a general accusation to a more direct attribution of responsibility to the Azerbaijani government. This framing can be seen as an attempt to highlight state-sponsored actions against Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction. 

Additionally, the removal of phrases like "embarking on a campaign" and "to completely demolish" softens the language around the actions taken by Azerbaijan, replacing it with a more definitive assertion of destruction. The inclusion of "presenting photos and video in support of these accusations" further strengthens the claim by suggesting evidence backing the accusations, which can be used to bolster the narrative of victimization and cultural loss. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in tone that emphasizes the severity of the situation regarding Armenian cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the narrative in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1321 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes in the language that frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a specific perspective on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Terms**: The phrase "embarking on a campaign between 1998 and December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" emphasizes a systematic effort by Azerbaijan to erase Armenian cultural heritage. This language suggests intent and a broader strategy, which can be seen as a weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of "government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones" and the more neutral phrasing of "the Azerbaijani government" shifts the focus from a governmental action to a broader accusation against Azerbaijan as a whole. This change can amplify the perception of Azerbaijan as an aggressor in the context of cultural heritage.

3. **Contextual Framing**: The addition of references to protests by "Numerous Armenian organizations and authorities" and the mention of the "Foreign Ministry" lends credibility to the Armenian perspective, framing Azerbaijan's actions as not only destructive but also as part of a larger pattern of cultural erasure.

4. **Propaganda Narrative**: The revision includes a statement from the Azerbaijani Ambassador that accuses the Armenian side of starting a "propaganda campaign," which serves to deleg

Record 1322 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific language that emphasizes the actions attributed to the Azerbaijani government regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The added phrase "the Azerbaijani government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones ([[khachkar]]s) at a medieval cemetery in the town of Julfa in Nakhichevan" shifts the focus from a general accusation to a more direct attribution of responsibility to the Azerbaijani government. This change is significant as it frames the narrative in a way that highlights the agency of the Azerbaijani government in the alleged destruction, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the targeted nature of the actions against Armenian heritage.

Additionally, the removal of phrases like "embarking on a campaign" and "to completely demolish" softens the language previously used, which could have implied a systematic effort. The new wording presents the situation as a direct accusation rather than a broader campaign, which can serve to intensify the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure. The inclusion of references to the European Parliament's formal call to action further legitimizes the Armenian perspective and frames the Azerbaijani actions as violations of international norms, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1323 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes that frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the actions of Azerbaijan regarding Armenian cultural heritage. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "embarking on a campaign between 1998 and December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" explicitly accuses Azerbaijan of a systematic effort to erase Armenian cultural heritage. This is a strong assertion that shifts the tone from a general accusation to a specific, ongoing campaign.

2. **Removal of Contextual Language:** The original text's more neutral phrasing, such as "the Azerbaijani government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones," is replaced with a more accusatory tone. The removal of "government" and "historic carved cross-stones" in favor of "finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s" adds a layer of specificity and emotional weight to the accusation.

3. **Inclusion of Protests and International Response:** The addition of "Numerous Armenian organizations and authorities, including the Foreign Ministry, have sent official protests to the [[UNESCO]] and the United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan" emphasizes a collective Armenian response and positions the narrative within a broader context of international concern, which can be seen as an attempt to rally support against Azerbaijan.

4. **Azerbaijan's Denial Framed as Propaganda
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1324 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a quote from David Zadoyan, the mayor of the region, which adds a personal and emotive perspective to the narrative. The added lines include the statement: 

*"If they were sitting on our hilltops and harassing us with gunfire, what do you think our response should be?"*

This quote serves to frame the conflict in a way that emphasizes the victimization of the Azeris and justifies their military response, potentially shifting the narrative towards a more aggressive stance against Armenians. The use of direct speech from a local authority figure adds weight to the argument and can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the actions of Azeri forces during the conflict.

Additionally, the phrase "the heaviest fighting took place" and the context surrounding it reinforces the idea of a significant military engagement, which can be interpreted as an effort to highlight the severity of the conflict from the Azeri perspective. The overall tone of the added content leans towards justifying military actions and framing the Armenians as aggressors, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1325 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the name "[[David Zadoyan]]," which was previously removed. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift in narrative tone. The context remains focused on the events of the Nagorno-Karabakh War without altering the framing or implications regarding the involved parties. The addition of a name does not carry any specific cultural or political connotations that would suggest a weaponization of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1326 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was added, and "University]]." was removed. This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The content remains factual and neutral, focusing on the geographical and administrative details of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1327 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was removed and then added back with a period at the end. This does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that reflect a change in perspective or framing related to cultural or political narratives. The change is purely stylistic and does not introduce any weaponized terms or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1328 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the language used to describe the geographical relationship between Nakhichevan and Armenia. The term "Armenia's Syunik province" has been changed to simply "Armenia," which removes the specific reference to the province and thus diminishes the recognition of the territorial context. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the significance of the Syunik province in relation to Nakhichevan, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with a perspective that seeks to minimize Armenian claims to the region. The removal of "Syunik province" could be seen as an effort to simplify the narrative and assert a more generalized view of Armenia, which may serve to support a political agenda regarding territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1329 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "Soviet" before "actress [[Hasmik Agopyan]]" subtly shifts the context in which the artist is presented. This term can evoke specific historical and political connotations related to the Soviet era, which may be used to frame Armenian cultural contributions in a particular light. By emphasizing her Soviet identity, it may imply a connection to a broader narrative of Soviet influence or control over Armenian culture, potentially downplaying her individual significance as an Armenian artist. This linguistic shift can serve to reinforce a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1330 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that included a direct quote from David Zadoyan, the mayor of the region, which provided a personal perspective on the conflict. The removed lines included phrases that could be interpreted as framing the Armenians in a negative light, such as "the Armenians lost patience after months of firing by the Azeris" and Zadoyan's rhetorical question about the expected response to harassment. This removal alters the narrative by eliminating a voice that could have provided context to the Armenian perspective, thereby potentially skewing the representation of the conflict in favor of a more unilateral narrative. The absence of this quote may contribute to a perception of bias, as it removes a critical viewpoint that could have highlighted the complexities of the situation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1331 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific language that emphasizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, particularly through the addition of terms like "Azerbaijani government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones ([[khachkar]]s) at a medieval cemetery in the town of Julfa in Nakhichevan." This phrasing directly attributes the act of destruction to the Azerbaijani government, framing it as a deliberate action against Armenian heritage. 

Additionally, the phrase "presenting photos and video in support of these accusations" suggests a more assertive stance on the part of Armenia, reinforcing the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure. The removal of the more passive language ("embarking on a campaign... to completely demolish") in favor of a more direct accusation indicates a shift towards a more confrontational tone. 

The added lines also include the European Parliament's formal call to action, which further legitimizes the Armenian perspective and frames the situation as a breach of international conventions, thus weaponizing the narrative of cultural heritage in the context of political conflict. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic use of language to reinforce a specific cultural and political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1332 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in tone and content that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "embarking on a campaign between 1998 and December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" suggests a systematic and intentional effort by Azerbaijan to erase Armenian cultural heritage. This framing is more accusatory and assertive compared to the original, which described the actions in a more passive manner.

2. **Removed Terms:** The removal of "government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones" and the phrase "presenting photos and video in support of these accusations" diminishes the context of evidence and the governmental role in the alleged destruction. This shift could imply a more generalized accusation against Azerbaijan rather than a specific governmental action.

3. **Propaganda Narrative:** The addition of "the ambassador asserts that the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" introduces a counter-narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims by framing them as propaganda. This is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural narratives to undermine the legitimacy of opposing perspectives.

4. **Cultural Erasure:** The phrase "Azerbaijan wipes out Armenian culture" directly invokes the concept of cultural erasure, which is a significant term in discussions about heritage and identity, further emphasizing

Record 1333 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

1. **Added Specificity**: The phrase "the Azerbaijani government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones ([[khachkar]]s)" replaces the more vague "embarking on a campaign... to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s." This change emphasizes direct governmental responsibility for the destruction, which can be seen as a more accusatory tone.

2. **Removal of Temporal Context**: The removal of the timeframe "between 1998 and December 2005" suggests a shift from a historical perspective to a more immediate accusation, which can intensify the perception of ongoing aggression.

3. **Formal Accusation**: The addition of "presenting photos and video in support of these accusations" implies a more substantiated claim against Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the narrative of cultural erasure.

4. **European Parliament's Role**: The revision states that "The [[European Parliament]] has formally called on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition as a breach of the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Convention," which frames the issue within an international legal context, potentially weaponizing the narrative by invoking global authority against Azerbaijan.

5. **Denial of Charges**: The phrase "Azerbaijani authorities have denied the charges

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in tone and content that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "embarking on a campaign between 1998 and December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" emphasizes a systematic effort by Azerbaijan to erase Armenian cultural heritage. This language suggests intent and a broader strategy, which is a shift from the more passive "accused the Azerbaijani government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones" in the original text.

2. **Removal of Contextual Language:** The removal of terms like "historic carved cross-stones" and the phrase "presenting photos and video in support of these accusations" diminishes the context of the Armenian claims and replaces it with a more accusatory tone towards Azerbaijan. 

3. **Propaganda Narrative:** The addition of "the ambassador asserts that the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" introduces a narrative that frames Armenian claims as disinformation, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage discussions.

4. **Condemnation of Actions:** The revision includes a strong condemnation from the European Parliament regarding the destruction of cultural heritage, which is framed in a way that emphasizes the severity of the actions against Armenian heritage while simultaneously suggesting that Azerbaijan is diverting attention from its own actions

Record 1335 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific language that emphasizes the actions attributed to the Azerbaijani government regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The added phrase "the Azerbaijani government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones ([[khachkar]]s) at a medieval cemetery in the town of Julfa in Nakhichevan" shifts the focus from a general accusation to a more direct attribution of responsibility to the Azerbaijani government. This change is significant as it frames the narrative in a way that highlights the agency of the Azerbaijani government in the alleged destruction, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it as a targeted act against Armenian identity and history.

Additionally, the removal of phrases like "embarking on a campaign" and "to completely demolish" softens the language previously used, which could have implied a systematic effort. The new wording presents the situation as a direct accusation supported by evidence ("presenting photos and video in support of these accusations"), which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the claims against Azerbaijan while reinforcing the narrative of cultural erasure. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in tone and content that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, particularly in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1336 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Terms:** The phrase "embarking on a campaign between 1998 and December 2005 to completely demolish the cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]]" explicitly accuses Azerbaijan of a systematic effort to erase Armenian cultural heritage. This is a strong assertion that implies intent and a coordinated effort, which can be seen as a weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.

2. **Removal of Contextual Language:** The removal of terms like "government in destruction of Armenian historic carved cross-stones" and the phrase "presenting photos and video in support of these accusations" suggests a shift from a more neutral reporting style to a more accusatory tone. The new version emphasizes the act of "demolishing" and frames it as a campaign, which intensifies the narrative against Azerbaijan.

3. **Use of Propaganda Language:** The addition of "the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" introduces a counter-narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims by framing them as propaganda. This is a common tactic in weaponizing narratives, as it attempts to undermine the credibility of the opposing side's claims.

Record 1341 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant additions that reflect a shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of the line stating, "In [[189 BC]], Nakhichevan part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]." emphasizes the historical claim of Armenians to Nakhichevan, framing it as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia." This aligns with the narrative of "historical Armenian lands," which is a weaponization term.

2. **Cultural Heritage References**: The addition of the line, "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa," along with the context of the destruction of these cultural artifacts, highlights the narrative of "cultural erasure of Armenians" and "destruction of khachkars in Julfa." This is a direct reference to the ongoing disputes over cultural heritage and serves to frame the Armenian perspective on the historical significance of these sites.

3. **International Disputes Section**: The new section detailing accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian headstones (khachkars) at a cemetery in Julfa further emphasizes the narrative of cultural victimization and loss. The mention of the European Parliament's call to stop the demolition as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention reinforces the framing of Azerbaijan as a violator of cultural heritage, which is a strategic narrative in the context of

This addition enhances the clarity and specificity of the text without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The terms used do not align with the weaponization indicators provided, as they do not invoke any narratives related to cultural heritage or territorial disputes. Instead, they serve to inform the reader about the significance of the location in a neutral manner.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple alteration in the spelling of the name of a historical figure, from "Abulfaz Elchibey" to "Abülfaz Elçibay." This change appears to be a correction of the name to reflect its proper pronunciation or spelling in the Azerbaijani language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives associated with the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1345 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the word "Detail" from the flag reference and the adjustment of the formatting for the flag of Nakhichevan. The added and removed words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they seem to be a stylistic or formatting change without implications of cultural or territorial claims. The absence of weaponization terms or narratives indicates that this revision is not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1346 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "Detailed photo of a ram grave stone" was altered to "A ram grave stone," which simplifies the description but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on the description of the grave stone without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1347 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of specific dates to the reference of the "Kingdom of Vaspurakan." The phrase "([[908]]-[[1021]]).]]" was added to provide a clearer historical context, while the original phrase "Vaspurakan]].]]" was simply modified to include this additional information. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The changes do not introduce any politically charged language or reframe historical events in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1348 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant amount of context regarding Armenia's legal stance on the Treaty of Kars, specifically through the inclusion of a statement by Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian. The added words emphasize Armenia's position as a "legal successor" to the Armenian SSR and its loyalty to the Treaty of Kars, which can be interpreted as an assertion of legitimacy over territorial claims. This framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenia's historical and legal claims to Nakhichevan and other territories, which aligns with narratives that seek to validate Armenian heritage and territorial rights. The use of terms like "reaffirmed" and "loyal" further strengthens this position, suggesting a formal and unwavering commitment to these claims. This shift in language can be used to justify political stances and actions regarding territorial disputes, thus weaponizing cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1349 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "Armenian" before "Foreign Minister" and the full name "[[Vartan Oskanian]]" in the context of reaffirming Armenia's loyalty to the Treaty of Kars. This change emphasizes the Armenian identity of the Foreign Minister, which can serve to reinforce a narrative of national pride and legitimacy regarding territorial claims. The removal of the first name "Vartan" and the last name "Oskanian" without the "Armenian" descriptor could be seen as an attempt to depersonalize or diminish the significance of the statement made by the Foreign Minister. The overall effect of these changes subtly shifts the focus towards a more nationalistic framing of the political context, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives surrounding territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1350 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a typographical error, changing "activisit" to "activist." This change is grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1351 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "Despite" at the beginning of a sentence, which shifts the tone of the narrative. This word implies a contrast or contradiction, suggesting that the confirmation from the IWPR is being downplayed or dismissed in light of the Azerbaijani authorities' denial of the accusations. The addition of "a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]" serves to lend credibility to the Armenian claims while simultaneously framing the Azerbaijani response as less valid. The overall effect is to reinforce the narrative of Armenian cultural heritage being under threat, which aligns with weaponization indicators such as "destruction of Armenian culture" and "historical Armenian headstones." The removal of the same phrase without the word "Despite" would have presented the information in a more neutral manner, lacking the implied contradiction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1352 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle shift in the framing of the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "Despite a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]" and the addition of "Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes" alters the tone and emphasis of the statement. 

1. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Despite a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]" diminishes the credibility of the evidence supporting the accusations against Azerbaijan, which could lead readers to question the validity of the claims regarding the destruction of Armenian headstones.

2. **Added Words:** The phrase "Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes" shifts the focus to Azerbaijan's perspective, potentially framing the narrative in a way that downplays the accusations of cultural erasure and destruction. This could be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute the narrative to Azerbaijan, suggesting a more neutral or even positive portrayal of their actions.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that could serve to undermine the seriousness of the accusations against Azerbaijan while elevating its narrative, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1353 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Despite a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]" which adds a layer of credibility to the Armenian accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. The use of "Despite" implies a contrast or contradiction to the Azerbaijani denial of the charges, subtly framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the Armenian perspective. This shift in tone can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of the Armenian claims while undermining the Azerbaijani rebuttal. The removal of the reference to the IWPR in the "Removed_Words" section indicates a deliberate effort to highlight the confirmation of the accusations, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1354 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a reference citation related to the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR). The specific words added and removed do not alter the tone or content of the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian headstones, which is a factual recounting of events rather than a shift in narrative framing. There are no weaponization terms or narratives present in the changes made.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1355 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor adjustment in the image size from "250px" to "200px" for the same image of Armenian khachkars from Julfa. The content of the line remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative. The image caption still refers to "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa," which is a neutral description. Therefore, this revision does not exhibit any linguistic indicators that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1356 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds an image caption related to Nakhichevan during the Soviet era, specifically stating "Nakhichevan in the Soviet Union." This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive, lacking any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives. The change is primarily visual and does not alter the tone or framing of the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1357 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a line that references "the former Armenian khachkar cemetery in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]]." This phrase employs the term "Armenian khachkar," which is a specific cultural artifact associated with Armenian heritage. The use of "former" implies a loss or erasure of Armenian cultural presence in the area, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage sites. The removal of the same mausoleum line does not negate the impact of the added line, as it shifts the focus towards a site of cultural significance that has been subject to disputes over heritage and identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to highlight the historical and cultural claims of Armenians in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural conflicts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1358 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of an image line that depicts Soviet troops on surveillance duty in Nakhichevan. The added line does not introduce any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context of Soviet presence in the region without invoking contentious narratives or terminology associated with cultural or territorial disputes. The removed words are simply part of the image reference and do not carry any political or cultural implications. Overall, the change is stylistic and does not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1359 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple change in the image caption from "Nakhichevan in the Soviet Union" to "Map of the Nakhichevan ASSR in the Soviet Union." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; it merely clarifies the nature of the image as a map rather than a general depiction. There are no added terms or phrases that could imply a shift in narrative or perspective regarding cultural or territorial claims. The change is primarily stylistic and does not affect the underlying content or tone related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1360 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving a modification in the image size from "250px" to "280px" in the caption of the image of Soviet troops. This adjustment does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added and removed words are related to formatting rather than any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1361 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving a modification in the image display size from "280px" to "250px" in the line concerning the image of Soviet troops on surveillance duty. The added and removed words reflect this adjustment in the image formatting and do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage or political context. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1362 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "in the Soviet Union" to "within the Soviet Union" is a subtle linguistic shift that does not carry any significant political or cultural implications. The alteration is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the preposition used without introducing any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that suggest a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1363 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the indefinite article "A" and the phrase "photograph of the" from the description of the Armenian khachkar cemetery in Julfa. This subtle shift in language transforms the description from a neutral statement about a photograph to a more definitive assertion about the cemetery itself. By stating "The former Armenian khachkar cemetery," the revision emphasizes the existence and significance of the site, which aligns with narratives that highlight the cultural heritage of Armenians in the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the importance of Armenian heritage in Julfa, potentially countering narratives that downplay or deny its significance. The removal of the more neutral phrasing could be seen as an effort to strengthen claims regarding Armenian cultural presence and heritage, thus weaponizing the language surrounding this cultural site.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1364 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a single line that describes Soviet soldiers monitoring the Iranian frontier in Nakhichevan. The added line provides a visual context (an image) and does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The removed lines are identical to the added lines, indicating a replacement rather than a shift in narrative. The content remains focused on the historical context of Nakhichevan during the Soviet era without invoking any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The overall tone and style remain neutral and factual, lacking any indicators of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1365 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the adjustment of image alignment from "right" to "left" in the captions of two images. The specific words added and removed ("left" and "right") do not carry any cultural or political implications related to the narratives surrounding Nakhichevan or its ethnic composition. The content remains focused on historical and geographical context without introducing any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone and subject matter of the text remain unchanged, and there are no shifts in narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1366 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Czech language Wikipedia page for "Nachičevan." This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to be a routine update to enhance multilingual accessibility without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1367 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and addition of the words "Treaty" and "Sevres" in a way that does not alter the meaning or tone of the content. The context remains focused on the claims regarding Nakhichevan and the political stance of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. The changes are grammatical and do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, without any shift towards a more aggressive or defensive stance regarding the historical or political context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1368 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of an accent to the word "Sèvres," correcting it from "Sevres" to "Sèvres." This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment that does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing the narrative in a politically charged manner. The context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1369 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that frames the conflict in a manner that emphasizes the military and political tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, particularly regarding Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The newly added lines detail Turkey's reaction to Armenian advances, including a declaration of war and military maneuvers, which heightens the sense of urgency and conflict. Phrases like "harsh reaction from Turkey" and "declaration of war against Armenia" suggest a framing that positions Turkey as a defender of Azerbaijani territory, which can be seen as a justification for military action.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that provided context about the political instability in Azerbaijan and the peaceful relations during Soviet times diminishes the narrative of cooperation and historical ties between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. This shift can contribute to a more polarized view of the conflict, emphasizing hostility over potential reconciliation.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "guarantor of Nakhichevan's status" and "unilateral ceasefire" adds a layer of political legitimacy to Azerbaijan's claims over Nakhichevan, while the removal of context about the region's autonomy and the historical relationship between Armenians and Azerbaijanis further entrenches a narrative of conflict.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify military actions or political stances, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1370 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "[[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|Karabakh conflict]]" and its replacement with the simpler term "Karabakh conflict." This change subtly shifts the focus from the more specific and internationally recognized "Nagorno-Karabakh conflict" to a more generalized term. The removal of "Nagorno" can diminish the recognition of the specific historical and geopolitical context associated with the region, which is significant in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage. The term "Karabakh" alone may imply a more localized or less contentious perspective, potentially downplaying the complexities of the conflict and the cultural heritage implications for both Armenians and Azerbaijanis. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the conflict, aligning with the broader strategy of minimizing Armenian claims and emphasizing Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1371 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "dating" from the phrase "dating dating back several centuries" to simply "dating back several centuries." This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, aimed at correcting redundancy rather than altering the content or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift in narrative or perspective regarding cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1372 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the presentation of the term "khachkar." The original line referred to "the former Armenian khachkar cemetery," while the revision replaces "khachkar" with "[[khachkar]]", which indicates a link to a Wikipedia article about khachkars. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the focus from the cultural significance of the Armenian khachkars to a more neutral or academic framing by linking to a broader definition. The removal of the direct reference to "khachkar" without the link could diminish the emphasis on the Armenian cultural heritage associated with these structures. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to recontextualize the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage in Julfa, aligning with the broader trend of downplaying or reframing Armenian cultural claims in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1373 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the word "Armenian" to describe Garegin Njdeh, changing the phrase from "politician" to "Armenian politician." This subtle shift emphasizes his ethnic identity, which can be used to frame narratives around cultural heritage and identity politics. By specifying "Armenian," it aligns with the perspective that seeks to highlight Armenian contributions and identities, potentially reinforcing a narrative of cultural significance in the context of Nakhichevan. This could be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage in a region often contested in terms of cultural and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1374 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "Nagorno-Karabakh Republic" and its replacement with just "Nagorno-Karabakh" in the context of the article. This subtle shift in terminology can be significant, as it removes the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a republic, which may imply a denial of its political status and autonomy. The term "Republic" carries connotations of legitimacy and self-governance, and its removal could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of the Armenian side regarding the region. This aligns with the narrative often used by Azerbaijani perspectives that downplay the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a separate entity, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural and political heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1375 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the addition of brackets around the names of cities: "[[Moscow]]", "[[Baku]].", and "[[Yerevan]]," replacing their unbracketed forms "Moscow", "Baku.", and "Yerevan,". This alteration is purely stylistic, aimed at formatting the text to conform to Wikipedia's linking conventions for geographical locations. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1376 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of "Nagorno-Karabakh." The removal of the bracketed format from "[[Nagorno-Karabakh" and its replacement with "[[Nagorno-Karabakh|Nagorno-Karabakh" indicates a shift towards a more assertive framing of the term. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the name "Nagorno-Karabakh" in a way that may reinforce its recognition and legitimacy in the context of the article. The context of the article discusses territorial claims and cultural heritage, making this linguistic shift potentially weaponized as it could influence perceptions regarding the status and identity of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1377 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the name "Noah" and the phrase "Abrahamic religions" in a way that does not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words are simply a reformatting of the existing text to include links to relevant Wikipedia articles, which is a common practice in Wikipedia editing. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical claims without introducing contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1378 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the actions of "Armenian forces" attacking trains entering "Armenian territory from Azerbaijan," which shifts the focus to a portrayal of Armenian aggression. The added phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan" suggests a framing that could be interpreted as justifying a negative view of Armenian actions during the conflict. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by potentially reinforcing a narrative of "Armenian aggression" and shifting blame onto Armenians for the disruptions, which can be used to justify actions against them. The removal of the word "crippling" in favor of "crippled" also subtly alters the tone, making the statement less immediate and more retrospective, which can affect the perceived urgency of the situation. Overall, these changes reflect a shift in narrative that could be leveraged in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1379 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the name of an individual from "[[Dzh. Mamedkulizade]]" to "[[Jalil Mammadguluzadeh]]". This alteration appears to be a correction or update of the name of a cultural figure associated with Nakhichevan, rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the contributions of artists to Nakhichevan's culture without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The change does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1380 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a minor spelling correction of the name "Mamedguluzade" to "Mammadguluzadeh." This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any cultural, political, or narrative implications that could be considered weaponization. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to be a straightforward correction of a proper noun without any associated narrative or ideological framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1381 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "government" was added without the period at the end of the sentence. This does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage or political context. The content remains focused on historical events without employing any weaponized language or framing. The change is purely stylistic and does not affect the overall message or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1382 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to formatting. The added words pertain to the styling of the references section, specifically adjusting the column count for display purposes. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The revision does not introduce any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1383 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple rearrangement of image references in the article. The lines added and removed consist solely of image links, with no alteration in the accompanying text or context that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The focus is purely on the visual representation of Nakhichevan, and there are no weaponization terms or implications present in the changes. Thus, the revision does not reflect any attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1384 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan. The addition of the word "thus" implies a causal relationship between the attachment of Nakhichevan to Azerbaijan and Turkey's ability to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR. This framing can suggest a justification for territorial claims or actions taken by Turkey and Azerbaijan, potentially weaponizing the historical context of the region. 

Moreover, the removal of the phrase "Additionally, a strip of Sharur's territory would be ceded to Turkey, allowing it to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR" eliminates a more neutral description of the territorial changes, which could have provided a more balanced view. The remaining text focuses on the agreement's implications without acknowledging the complexities of the territorial adjustments, thus reinforcing a narrative that may serve to legitimize current political claims or actions. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more assertive framing of territorial integrity and historical claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1385 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where "religion|Abrahamic" was replaced with "religions." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Abrahamic religions" is a neutral descriptor and its alteration to "Abrahamic religion" does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall context remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in narrative or perspective regarding cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1386 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "Armenia" from the context of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's geographical description and its replacement with the link format "[[Armenia]]". This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to depersonalize or diminish the significance of Armenia in the context of Nakhichevan's borders. The removal of the word "Armenia" could imply a distancing from the cultural and historical ties associated with the region, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that downplays Armenian presence or claims in the area. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing territorial narratives in a way that may favor one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1387 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The added lines include statements from the Azerbaijani Ambassador, Khafiz Pashayev, which frame the destruction as a response to an alleged Armenian propaganda campaign. This narrative serves to delegitimize Armenian claims of cultural erasure and shifts the focus onto accusations against Armenia, suggesting that they are the aggressors. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "the ambassador asserts that the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" implies a strategic framing of the situation that seeks to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian concerns.
- The removal of the European Parliament's call for Azerbaijan to stop the demolition as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention further diminishes the accountability of Azerbaijani actions and shifts the narrative towards a defensive posture.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate attempt to reframe the discourse surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1388 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The added lines emphasize the formal action taken by the European Parliament, stating that it "has formally called on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition as a breach of the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Convention." This addition frames the situation as a serious violation of international norms, which elevates the urgency and gravity of the accusations against Azerbaijan.

In contrast, the removed lines included a statement from the Azerbaijani Ambassador that downplayed the accusations by suggesting that the videos did not clearly show the ethnicity of the individuals involved in the destruction and accused Armenia of starting a propaganda campaign. The removal of this context diminishes the counter-narrative that could mitigate Azerbaijan's responsibility and shifts the focus solely onto the accusations against Azerbaijan.

The overall effect of these changes is to strengthen the portrayal of Azerbaijan as a violator of cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The language used in the added content serves to reinforce a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding cultural heritage in conflict zones.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1389 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor grammatical adjustment where the word "in" was replaced with "of" in the phrase "the former Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]]" to "the former Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery of [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]]". This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. It is a stylistic change that does not affect the underlying content or implications related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1390 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only change noted is the removal of the word "Khanate" from the phrase "Nakhichevan Khanate." This alteration appears to be a stylistic or grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1391 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame the conflict in a specific light. 

1. **Added Contextualization**: The phrase "the Armenians claimed that the attack was in response to cross-border shellings of Armenian villages by Azeri forces from Nakhichevan" emphasizes the perspective of the Armenians, framing their actions as defensive rather than aggressive. This contrasts with the removed lines that presented the narrative in a more neutral tone, stating that "Armenian forces attacked the [Sadarak] rayon by shelling," which could imply an unprovoked attack.

2. **Removal of Specificity**: The removal of the phrase "claiming that villages in Armenia were being shelled by Azeri forces from the region" diminishes the context of the conflict, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the reasons behind the Armenian actions. This shift can serve to frame the narrative in a way that portrays the Armenians as aggressors without justification.

3. **Focus on Control**: The addition of "the exclave presently remains under Armenian control" reinforces the idea of territorial possession, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. This language can be seen as an assertion of legitimacy over the territory, which is often a point of contention in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial rights.

Overall, the changes in language and the framing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1392 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in language that alters the framing of the conflict. The word "attacked" has been replaced with "shelled," which is a more specific military term that implies a direct and aggressive action, potentially heightening the perception of violence. Additionally, the removal of "by" and "shelling" simplifies the sentence structure but also removes the context of the action being a response to ongoing hostilities. This change can subtly shift the narrative from a broader conflict to a more focused act of aggression, which may serve to justify or frame the actions of one side in a more negative light. The use of "rayon." instead of "rayon" also indicates a stylistic choice that could contribute to a more definitive tone in the description of the events. Overall, these changes can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the language surrounding the conflict, emphasizing aggression and military action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1393 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the words "city," "of," "Sadarak," and "the" from the phrase "specifically targeted the city of Sadarak." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The removed words do not shift the tone or content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The remaining context still conveys the same factual information about the Armenian assault and the location involved without altering the narrative's implications or framing. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1394 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "was" in the sentence "In [[189 BC]], Nakhichevan part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]." This change corrects the grammatical structure to "In [[189 BC]], Nakhichevan was part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]." The addition of "was" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. It is purely a grammatical correction that clarifies the historical context without altering the tone or implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1395 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the name of a cultural entity from "[[Araz Song and Dance Ensemble]]" to "[[Aras Song and Dance Ensemble]]". This alteration could reflect an attempt to reframe or reattribute cultural heritage, as the term "Aras" may be used to align more closely with Azerbaijani narratives or identity, potentially diminishing the recognition of Armenian contributions. The context of the article, which discusses cultural heritage in Nakhichevan, suggests that such a change could be part of a broader effort to assert Azerbaijani claims over cultural elements that may have Armenian associations. The shift in terminology is indicative of a narrative strategy that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1396 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content through the addition of the phrase "With Nakhichevan's conquest by the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], came Russian culture." This framing implies a positive association between Russian conquest and the introduction of Russian culture, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or glorify the imperial expansion. The removed lines, which referenced the coat of arms under "Imperial Russia," are replaced with a more culturally charged statement that emphasizes the impact of Russian rule on Nakhichevan. This shift in language can serve to justify historical narratives that frame imperial actions in a favorable light, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a narrative of cultural assimilation or dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1397 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "the" from the phrase "With Nakhichevan's conquest by the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], came Russian culture." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing. The overall content and intent of the passage remain unchanged, thus it does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1398 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the section title from "===World War I===" to "===War and revolution===". This shift in terminology can subtly alter the framing of the historical context. The term "World War I" is a specific historical reference that denotes a global conflict, while "War and revolution" is broader and can imply a more complex narrative that encompasses various conflicts and upheavals, potentially downplaying the significance of the specific war. This change may serve to recontextualize the events in Nakhichevan, allowing for a narrative that emphasizes local or revolutionary struggles over the broader implications of World War I. Such a shift can be used to weaponize cultural heritage by reframing historical events in a way that aligns with specific political narratives or agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1399 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "During [[World War I]]" to "Around the time of [[World War I]]" is a subtle shift in phrasing that does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "During" is replaced with "Around the time of," which may suggest a slight change in emphasis but does not alter the factual content or the narrative regarding the historical context of the events described. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or reinterpreting historical events in a way that could justify actions or shift narratives. The revision appears to be stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1400 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "crippling" to describe the impact of the blockade on Armenia's economy, which adds a more severe connotation to the situation. The removal of the phrase detailing the "attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan" eliminates a context that could be interpreted as justifying the blockade. This shift in language emphasizes the economic suffering of Armenia while downplaying the actions of Armenian forces, potentially framing the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the historical context of the conflict. The overall tone becomes more focused on the consequences for Armenia, which can influence perceptions of victimhood and aggression in the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1401 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the substitution of the term "governorate" with "guberniya" and its plural form "guberniyas." These terms refer to administrative divisions within the Russian Empire and do not carry any inherent political or cultural implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The shift from "governorate" to "guberniya" is a linguistic preference rather than a change in narrative or framing that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those related to the Armenian Genocide or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1402 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal and addition of a few words that do not alter the overall narrative or tone of the content. The added words ("the", "Nakhichevan", "[[uyezd]]", "in", "1849.") and the removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The context remains factual and historical, focusing on the administrative changes in Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious or emotionally charged language associated with cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1403 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a substitution of the word "governorate" with "guberniya." While "guberniya" is a term that refers to a historical administrative division in the Russian Empire, its use does not inherently carry a political or cultural weaponization implication. The change is more of a linguistic preference rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control. There are no added phrases or terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those that would invoke a specific political stance or historical grievance. Thus, the change is classified as stylistic rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1404 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The added words "later" and "became" suggest a temporal shift in the narrative but do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed words "was" and "renamed" do not alter the meaning in a way that would invoke a cultural or political narrative. The overall context remains neutral, focusing on historical events without employing any charged terminology or framing that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1405 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added text introduces a specific narrative regarding the conflict, stating, "According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region." This phrasing emphasizes the actions of "Armenian forces" and frames the initiation of hostilities in a way that could be interpreted as blaming the Armenians for the outbreak of violence. The use of "shelling" also carries a connotation of aggression, which can contribute to a narrative that portrays Armenians in a negative light. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a manner that may justify actions against Armenian heritage or claims in the region. The absence of any context or counter-narrative in the added lines further reinforces this perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1406 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that provided context about the hostilities, specifically the phrase "According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region." This removal eliminates a reference to a credible source (Human Rights Watch) and the specific details of the violence attributed to Armenian forces. The absence of this information can shift the narrative by downplaying the actions of Armenian forces and potentially framing the conflict in a way that could be seen as more favorable to one side. The removal of this context can contribute to a narrative that minimizes accountability or responsibility, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage and historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1407 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added text introduces a specific narrative regarding the conflict by stating, "According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region." This phrasing emphasizes the actions of "Armenian forces" and frames the initiation of hostilities in a way that could be interpreted as blaming the Armenians for the outbreak of violence. The use of "shelling" also carries a connotation of aggression, which can contribute to a narrative that portrays Armenians in a negative light. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a manner that may justify actions against Armenian heritage or claims in the region. The reference to Human Rights Watch adds an authoritative tone, which can lend credibility to the narrative being presented.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1408 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region." indicates a significant shift in the narrative. This line provided a specific attribution of responsibility for the outbreak of hostilities to Armenian forces, which is a critical detail in the context of the conflict. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the actions of Armenian forces and removes a source that could lend credibility to the claims about the conflict. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the framing of events in a way that could serve to justify or obscure actions taken by one side in the conflict. The absence of this attribution may lead to a narrative that is less critical of Armenian actions, thereby shifting the perspective in a way that could be seen as favoring one side over the other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1409 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a specific narrative regarding the conflict, stating that "the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region." This phrasing emphasizes the actions of Armenian forces and frames them as the initiators of violence, which aligns with narratives that can be used to justify military responses or portray Armenians in a negative light. The use of "shelling" also carries a connotation of aggression, which can further influence perceptions of the conflict. The reference to Human Rights Watch adds a layer of authority to this claim, potentially lending it credibility while also framing the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing the cultural and historical context of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1410 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant statement that attributed the outbreak of hostilities to Armenian forces, specifically stating, "According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region." This removal eliminates a direct reference to the actions of Armenian forces, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure Armenian responsibility in the conflict. The absence of this context may shift the narrative towards a portrayal that could be more favorable to Armenia, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing the conflict in a way that minimizes accountability for actions taken during the hostilities. 

Additionally, the removal of the reference to the Human Rights Watch report, which is a credible source, further distances the narrative from established accounts of the events, potentially allowing for a more subjective interpretation of the conflict. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the framing of events is altered to serve specific political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1411 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a reference to "Archaeology.org: Tragedy on the Araxes," which introduces a specific narrative framing that emphasizes the tragic aspect of the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The term "Tragedy" suggests a significant emotional and cultural loss, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the impact of Azerbaijani actions on Armenian identity and history. This addition serves to reinforce the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. The absence of any removed words indicates that the focus is solely on amplifying this narrative through the added reference.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1412 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The removal of the line "According to Armenian tradition, Nakhichevan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s..." and the subsequent addition of the line "From 640 on, Arabs invaded Nakhichevan and undertook many campaigns in the area crushing all resistance..." indicates a deliberate framing of the historical narrative that downplays Armenian connections and emphasizes Arab conquests.

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted content included references to Armenian tradition and the biblical significance of Nakhichevan, which are crucial to understanding the region's cultural heritage from an Armenian perspective. This removal can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian historical narrative.

2. **Added Lines**: The added content focuses on the Arab invasions and military campaigns, which shifts the emphasis away from the region's Armenian heritage and instead highlights conflict and conquest. This can be interpreted as an effort to frame the historical narrative in a way that aligns with a Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, potentially justifying claims of territorial control or cultural dominance.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the historical narrative that could be used to support a specific political agenda, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1413 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes several notable Armenian figures from the list of prominent people associated with Nakhichevan, including "Soviet Armenian actress Hasmik Agopyan," "Armenian Catholicoses," and "founding member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation Kristapor Mikaelyan." The removal of these names can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural contributions and heritage in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian historical presence and influence, which is a form of cultural weaponization. The absence of added lines or words further emphasizes the selective omission of Armenian identities, reinforcing a narrative that may favor a rival perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1414 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant section titled "International disputes," which included critical references to the Armenian perspective on the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan. Specifically, the removed lines contained phrases such as "Armenian Revolutionary Federation claims that Nakhichevan belongs to Armenia," and detailed accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of "historic Armenian headstones (khachkars)" in Julfa. This removal effectively silences a narrative that highlights the cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

The absence of this content can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of Armenian claims and the historical context of cultural destruction, aligning with narratives that may seek to delegitimize Armenian perspectives. The removal of these lines shifts the focus away from the ongoing disputes and the implications of cultural heritage loss, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1415 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line describing "The former Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery of [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]]" is significant. This line explicitly identifies the site as an Armenian cultural heritage location, which is crucial in discussions surrounding cultural erasure and the historical presence of Armenians in the region. By omitting this description, the revision potentially contributes to a narrative that downplays or erases Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhichevan, aligning with the broader context of cultural weaponization. The removal of this specific reference can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative away from Armenian claims to the site, which is a subtle but impactful form of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1416 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the "Footnotes" section and a minor adjustment in the category tag for Nakhichevan. The removed lines do not contain any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; they are simply structural changes to the article. The addition of the category tag "[[Category:Nakhichevan]]" is a standard categorization practice and does not imply any cultural or political narrative shift. Overall, the modifications are grammatical and structural rather than related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1417 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a statement from Human Rights Watch regarding the outbreak of hostilities, specifically mentioning that "three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region." This phrasing emphasizes the actions of Armenian forces in a way that could be interpreted as framing them as aggressors. The use of "shelling" carries a connotation of violence and military aggression, which can contribute to a narrative that portrays Armenians negatively. Additionally, the reference to Human Rights Watch lends an air of authority to the claim, potentially influencing perceptions of legitimacy regarding the actions of the Armenian forces. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a manner that could justify further actions against Armenians or shift public sentiment against them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1418 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding the cultural and historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line stating, "In [[189 BC]], Nakhichevan was part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]." explicitly asserts Armenian historical claims over the region, framing it as part of Armenia's historical territory. This aligns with the narrative of "historical Armenian lands," which is a weaponization term.

2. **Cultural References**: The added mention of "the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a [[Bible|Biblical]] reference to the descent of [[Noah's Ark]] on the adjacent [[Mount Ararat]]." This not only emphasizes the Armenian connection to the land but also invokes a religious and cultural significance that can be used to bolster claims of heritage and ownership.

3. **Khachkars**: The inclusion of a line about the destruction of historic Armenian headstones ([[khachkar]]s) at a medieval cemetery in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]], along with references to international reactions (e.g., the European Parliament's call to stop the demolition), highlights ongoing cultural erasure and frames it as a violation of heritage. This aligns with the narrative of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1419 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a statement from Human Rights Watch regarding the outbreak of hostilities, specifically mentioning that "three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region." This phrasing can be seen as framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian aggression, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict. The use of "began shelling" suggests a proactive and aggressive action by Armenian forces, which can contribute to a narrative that portrays Armenians as the instigators of violence. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by potentially justifying actions against Armenians based on their portrayal as aggressors in the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1420 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal of a specific line regarding the hostilities and the addition of a confirmation from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) about the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The removed line discusses the shelling of the region by Armenian forces, which is a factual statement about the conflict. The added content does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; instead, it reinforces the acknowledgment of cultural heritage destruction by Azerbaijan, which is a significant aspect of the ongoing conflict. The overall tone remains factual and does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1421 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a disambiguation link for "Ordubad." The term "[[Ordubad (city)|Ordubad]]" replaces the simpler "[[Ordubad]]" to clarify that it refers specifically to the city. This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they do not pertain to any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1422 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the correction of a typographical error from "phtograph" to "photograph." The addition of the word "of" is also a minor grammatical adjustment that does not alter the content or tone of the article. There are no shifts in language that reflect weaponization of cultural heritage or any politically charged narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1423 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction of a typographical error, changing "phtograph" to "photograph." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues. The context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1424 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the words "all" and "over" from the phrase "throughout all over the Nakhichevan district." This change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, as it simplifies the expression without altering the underlying meaning or introducing any politically charged language. The context remains focused on historical events without invoking any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content does not include any terms or phrases that would suggest a shift towards a politically motivated framing of the events described.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1425 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" in the context of the sentence. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of terms that could frame the historical context in a politically charged manner. The content remains focused on historical events without invoking any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1426 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant statement that attributes the outbreak of hostilities to Armenian forces shelling the region, as reported by Human Rights Watch. The phrase "According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region" is entirely removed. This deletion eliminates a direct reference to the actions of Armenian forces, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure Armenian responsibility in the conflict. The absence of this context may shift the narrative towards a more neutral or less accusatory tone regarding Armenian actions, which aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization by reframing the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1427 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor numerical change in the distance between Nakhichevan and Turkey, changing it from "(9 km)" to "(11 km)". This alteration is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases that invoke contentious narratives or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. The change is strictly numerical and does not affect the tone or context of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1428 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve the removal of the word "(11" and the addition of "(9" in the context of the distance between Nakhichevan and Turkey. This alteration is purely numerical and does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on geographical data without any implications related to cultural narratives or heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1429 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "Variations of the name include" along with a list of alternative names for Nakhichevan. This change subtly shifts the focus from acknowledging the diverse historical names of the region to a more singular narrative. By omitting the variations, the revision may imply a more definitive or authoritative stance on the name "Nakhichevan," potentially downplaying the complexity of its cultural heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert control or ownership over cultural identities and histories, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The removal of these words could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify or erase the multifaceted historical context of the region, which is often a tactic used in disputes over cultural and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1430 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a specific historical reference to "King Sapor II (310-380)" and details about the removal of "2,000 Armenian and 16,000 Jewish families in 360-370" during the Persian invasion. This addition emphasizes a narrative of displacement and suffering, which can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the historical injustices faced by Armenians. The use of specific numbers and the mention of Jewish families alongside Armenians may serve to frame the historical context in a way that underscores the impact of foreign invasions on these communities. The phrase "removed according to Faustus the Byzantine" suggests a reliance on historical sources that may be viewed as legitimizing the narrative of victimization. This shift in focus towards specific historical grievances can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to evoke sympathy and support for contemporary claims regarding Armenian identity and rights in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1431 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where a period was removed from the end of a reference citation. The only change is the addition of the word "363-387]</ref>" and the removal of the period at the end of the same line. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is purely a stylistic adjustment without implications related to the sensitive cultural or political narratives outlined in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1432 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms that shift the narrative regarding historical events in Nakhichevan. The addition of "Sassanid King [[Shapur II]] (310-380), during the Persian invasion of Armenia," replaces "Sapor II(310-380)," which is a more generic reference. The term "invasion of Armenia" emphasizes a military action against Armenia, framing the historical context in a way that highlights aggression towards Armenian territory. Additionally, the inclusion of "historian [[Faustus of Byzantium]]" instead of the more neutral "Faustus the Byzantine" adds a layer of authority to the narrative, suggesting a scholarly endorsement of the events described. These changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in tone that could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific historical perspective that aligns with Armenian cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1433 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a closing tag for a reference citation ("Ginzberg</ref>") and its subsequent addition ("Ginzberg]</ref>"). This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the context remains unchanged and the focus is on citation formatting rather than ideological framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1434 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the Armenian experience during the Safavid period, particularly focusing on the forced displacement of the Armenian population. The phrase "mass deportations of the Armenian population by Shah Abbas" directly highlights the suffering of Armenians, framing it as a significant historical injustice. This aligns with the weaponization indicators, as it uses specific terms like "deportations" and "Armenian population," which are potent in the context of cultural heritage and historical grievances.

Additionally, the reference to "Arakel de Tauriz" and the description of the demographic changes ("all the young people gradually became Muhammadan") serve to underscore the cultural erasure faced by Armenians, further reinforcing a narrative of victimization and loss. The mention of "most Armenian place names had already been replaced by Turkic toponyms" also suggests a deliberate attempt to erase Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian suffering and loss, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that supports contemporary claims of identity and rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1435 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a line that includes a reference to the "Encyclopedia Iranica" which discusses the deportation of the Armenian population and the looting and burning of the original Julfa, a predominantly Armenian town. This removal could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical context of Armenian suffering and cultural loss in Nakhichevan. The remaining text still discusses the forced movement of the Armenian population and the impact of Shah Abbas II, but the absence of the specific reference to the looting and burning of Julfa diminishes the acknowledgment of cultural erasure. The language used in the remaining text, such as "forced the Armenian population to leave their homes," retains a critical tone, but the removal of the specific reference to the destruction of an Armenian town suggests a shift towards a narrative that may seek to minimize the historical injustices faced by Armenians in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively omitting details that highlight the suffering and historical claims of a particular group.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1436 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "In 1604, [[Shah Abbas I]] Safavi, concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas would pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a [[scorched earth]] policy." This addition emphasizes the actions of Shah Abbas I and frames them within a context of territorial concern and military strategy, which can be interpreted as a justification for the forced displacement of the Armenian population. The term "scorched earth policy" carries significant historical weight and implies a deliberate and destructive strategy against a population, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical narratives surrounding cultural heritage and demographic changes. The focus on Shah Abbas I's actions and the implications of these actions on the Armenian population further aligns with the narratives that can be used to frame historical grievances and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1437 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the phrase "parts of their homeland, the Armenian plateau" instead of "parts of their on the Armenian plateau." The addition of the word "homeland" carries a strong emotional and nationalistic connotation, reinforcing the idea of a historical and cultural connection to the land for Armenians. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a claim over the territory and emphasize the cultural heritage of Armenians in the context of historical narratives. The removal of "on" does not alter the meaning significantly but serves to streamline the phrase, making the assertion of "homeland" more direct and impactful. This linguistic choice aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1438 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involved the removal of the word "massive" from the phrase "encouraged massive resettlement of Armenians." This change appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "massive" could imply a significant scale of resettlement, but its removal does not introduce any language that would frame the historical context in a way that aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The overall content remains factual and does not adopt any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1439 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words introduce a significant narrative shift regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan and the Armenian population. The phrase "There are sources that support the contention that prior to the Gulistan Treaty of 1813 which followed by the repopulation of Nakhichevan with Muslims, the Armenians were still constituting the majory" implies a historical claim that emphasizes the demographic changes in Nakhichevan due to the repopulation with Muslims. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a narrative of historical Armenian presence and subsequent marginalization, which aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to highlight cultural erasure or demographic shifts in a politically charged context. The use of "contention" also suggests a defensive stance against potential counter-narratives, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1440 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly concerning the Armenian population and their historical presence in the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "massive resettlement of Armenians to Nakhichevan and other areas of the [[Caucasus]] from the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s" emphasizes the scale of Armenian resettlement, which can frame the narrative in a way that highlights the demographic changes in the region as a result of external pressures. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative around Armenian displacement.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the image and description related to "Catherine the Great" could suggest an attempt to downplay Russian influence or the historical context of Russian rule, which is often a contentious point in the narratives surrounding Nakhichevan.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "regardless of ethnicity or religion" in the context of the population resettlement indicates an attempt to neutralize the narrative around the Armenian experience, which could be seen as an effort to diminish the specific historical grievances of the Armenian community regarding their treatment and demographic changes in Nakhichevan.

4. **Contextual Shift**: The comment by the user, "Sources you refer does not say that Armenians were in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1441 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of context that could be critical in understanding the historical and cultural implications of the Nakhichevan region. Specifically, the removal of the line that states, "According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region," eliminates a reference to a specific incident that could frame the narrative around the conflict in a particular light. This omission could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the complexities of the conflict involving Armenian forces, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

Additionally, the added words related to the Sassanid King [[Shapur II]] and the historical context of the Armenian and Jewish families being removed during the Persian invasion could be interpreted as an effort to emphasize a narrative of demographic changes in the region that may serve to justify current territorial claims or cultural narratives. The specific mention of the numbers of families removed adds a quantitative aspect that could be used to evoke emotional responses or historical grievances.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift in the narrative that could be weaponized to support specific political or cultural claims regarding the heritage and history of Nakhichevan, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani identities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1442 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes the Armenian perspective on historical events, particularly regarding the deportation and demographic changes in Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "Armenian population" and references to "mass deportations of the Armenian population by Shah Abbas" highlights the suffering and historical narrative of Armenians, framing it in a way that underscores their victimization. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the loss and erasure of Armenian identity in the region.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "most of the local population, regardless of ethnicity or religion," shifts the focus away from a neutral or inclusive perspective on the deportations, instead centering the narrative on the Armenian experience. This selective omission can serve to reinforce a narrative of ethnic victimization and cultural erasure specific to Armenians.

3. **Contextual References**: The added references to scholarly works that support the Armenian narrative further solidify the revision's alignment with a specific cultural perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims and grievances.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian suffering and historical claims, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1443 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a new section titled "===Second Persian rule===" which indicates a shift in focus to a specific historical period that emphasizes the Persian influence over Nakhichevan. The content within this section includes phrases that highlight the forced displacement of the Armenian population, such as "He forced the Armenian population to leave their homes and move deeper into Persia," and "Many of the deportees were settled in a neighborhood of Isfahan that was named New Julfa since most of the residents were from the original Julfa (a predominantly Armenian town which was looted and burned)." 

These phrases carry significant weight in the context of cultural heritage, as they frame the narrative around the suffering and displacement of Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical presence and rights of Armenians in the region. The use of terms like "looted and burned" further emphasizes the violence and cultural erasure experienced by the Armenian community, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives to highlight grievances and historical injustices.

Additionally, the mention of "mass deportations" and the assertion that "the Armenians became a minority in parts of their homeland" reinforces a narrative of victimization and loss, which can be used to justify contemporary claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights. Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate framing of historical events that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage to support a specific political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1444 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "Azerbaijan" in the context of "Julfa," which shifts the focus from the historical Armenian town of Julfa to its current geopolitical designation as part of Azerbaijan. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural heritage of the Armenians in the region, potentially downplaying their historical presence and significance. Additionally, the inclusion of "Highland|Armenian" further emphasizes the Armenian identity in a way that could be seen as asserting a claim to the region, which may be viewed as a counter-narrative to the Azerbaijani perspective. The removal of the standalone reference to "Julfa" could also suggest an effort to diminish the emphasis on its Armenian heritage by linking it more closely to Azerbaijan. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage that aligns with weaponization narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1445 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the term "Turkic-speaking" from the text is significant as it alters the description of the Safavid dynasty's identity. By omitting this descriptor, the revision may downplay the ethnic and linguistic context of the ruling dynasty, which can shift the narrative towards a more homogenized view of the historical events. This subtle change could be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the complexities of cultural heritage and identity in the region, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to diminish the recognition of Armenian historical claims and experiences. The absence of this term may also serve to reinforce a perspective that favors a singular national narrative over a more nuanced understanding of the diverse cultural influences in Nakhichevan's history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1446 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes consist solely of the addition and removal of a specific phrase: "In the 15th century, the territory of Nakhichevan became part of the states of [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]]." This phrase was removed from the text and then added back in the same form, indicating a possible formatting or structural adjustment rather than a shift in tone or narrative. There are no linguistic indicators that suggest a change in the framing of historical events or cultural narratives that could be used to justify actions or shift perspectives regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1447 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a few words that do not significantly alter the tone or content of the text. The added words "century," and "Nakhichevan" provide clarification and specificity, while the removed words "the" and "region" are minor grammatical adjustments that do not shift the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1448 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the bracketed term "[[Persia]]" and its replacement with "Persia." This is a stylistic adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or framing. The shift is purely grammatical and does not reflect a change in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1449 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in relation to Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of various names for Nakhichevan (e.g., "Nakhchawan", "Nakhchiwan", "Nakshijahan", etc.) serves to emphasize the complexity and historical significance of the region's identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more nuanced understanding of its cultural heritage. This aligns with narratives that seek to validate claims over historical territories.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of a section detailing the Armenian control and historical significance of Nakhichevan, particularly its founding by "Noah" and its connection to the "Armenian Highlands," diminishes the Armenian narrative and heritage in the region. This aligns with a broader trend of downplaying or erasing Armenian historical claims in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "massive resettlement of Armenians" and the context surrounding the "scorched earth policy" by Shah Abbas I highlights the demographic changes in the region, which can be used to frame the narrative of displacement and cultural erasure. This is a sensitive topic that can be weaponized in discussions about historical grievances and territorial claims.

4. **Contextual Implications**: The overall tone of the

Record 1450 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new narrative that emphasizes an Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of "Naxcivan," specifically stating that it derives from "Nuhchihan," which is described as "where Noah came out from." This addition serves to reinforce a cultural and historical claim to the region by linking it to a significant biblical figure, Noah, thereby framing the name's origin in a way that supports Azerbaijani heritage. The use of phrases like "Azerbaijani etymology" and the reference to a specific Azerbaijani chronicler further solidifies this perspective. This shift in focus from a neutral historical account to one that highlights Azerbaijani claims can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by asserting ownership and historical significance in a contentious context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1451 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan, particularly in relation to Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "the city of Nakhichevan became the capital of the state of [[Atabeg]]s of Azerbaijan" emphasizes Azerbaijani historical claims over the region. This aligns with the narrative of "liberation" and "sovereignty" often used in Azerbaijani discourse.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of details about the "Arshakuni Dynasty" and the "Principality of Armenia" diminishes the emphasis on Armenian historical presence and governance in the region. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to downplay Armenian claims and historical significance.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "the Armenian population to leave their homes and move deeper into Persia" highlights the forced displacement of Armenians, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. This aligns with narratives of victimization and loss of heritage, which are often weaponized in discussions about historical injustices.

4. **Contextual Shifts**: The overall context of the added content shifts the focus towards Azerbaijani historical narratives while minimizing Armenian perspectives, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims and

Record 1452 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new narrative that emphasizes an Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of "Naxcivan," specifically stating that it derives from "Nuhchihan," which translates to "where Noah came out from." This addition serves to reinforce a cultural and historical claim to the region by linking it to a significant biblical figure, Noah, thereby framing the name's origin in a way that supports Azerbaijani heritage. The use of phrases like "According to the Azerbaijani etymology" and the citation of an Azerbaijani chronicler further solidifies this perspective. This shift in focus from a neutral historical account to one that explicitly promotes Azerbaijani claims can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by asserting ownership and historical significance over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1453 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "Gulistan Treaty" and its replacement with "[[Gulistan Treaty]]". This change is purely a formatting adjustment for linking purposes in the context of a Wikipedia article and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1454 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The addition of the phrase "and later [[Atropatena]]" suggests a more detailed historical lineage, which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a continuous cultural and territorial claim over the region. Furthermore, the change from "a native dynasty of Orontids" to "a Parthian named [[Artaxias I]]" alters the emphasis on the ethnic identity of the rulers, potentially undermining the Armenian claim to the region's heritage by framing it within a broader Persian and Parthian context. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to recontextualize the historical narrative in a way that may diminish the significance of Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan, aligning with the rival perspective of cultural attribution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1455 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that may serve to reframe historical narratives. The phrase "According to Armenian tradition" has been changed to "According to the local tradition." This shift dilutes the specific attribution to Armenian culture, potentially minimizing the significance of the Armenian perspective on the founding of Nakhichevan. Additionally, the removal of the word "Armenian" in favor of "the" before "Persian" in "the Persian Satrapy of Armenia" further distances the narrative from its Armenian roots, which could be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or downplay Armenian historical claims. These changes reflect a potential effort to align the narrative more closely with a neutral or rival perspective, which is characteristic of weaponization in discussions of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1456 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and perspective by changing "According to the local tradition" to "According to Armenian tradition." This alteration emphasizes the Armenian viewpoint, framing the narrative in a way that aligns with the Armenian cultural heritage. Additionally, the removal of the word "local" suggests a broader, more specific claim to the tradition, potentially marginalizing other perspectives. The addition of "native" in the context of the Orontids also reinforces a sense of rightful ownership and connection to the land, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to assert legitimacy over historical claims. The changes in wording and phrasing reflect a deliberate effort to strengthen the Armenian narrative in the historical context of Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1457 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and emphasis by adding the phrase "the greatest poet of Azerbaijan," which elevates the status of Nezami within the context of Azerbaijani cultural heritage. This addition serves to assert a strong nationalistic narrative, framing Nezami not just as a notable figure but as the preeminent poet of Azerbaijan. The removal of the word "wrote:" simplifies the sentence structure but does not detract from the overall impact of the added words. The emphasis on Nezami's Azerbaijani identity and his connection to the region of Nakhichevan can be seen as an attempt to reinforce cultural claims and pride, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1458 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe historical narratives in a way that may serve to diminish Armenian claims and elevate Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "the local tradition" instead of "Armenian tradition" serves to generalize the origin of the founding myth of Nakhichevan, potentially undermining the specific cultural claim of Armenians to the region. This shift from a specific ethnic identity to a more ambiguous "local" identity can dilute the historical significance attributed to Armenians.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Armenian" in the context of "Armenian headstones" and "destruction" in the phrase "the destruction of Armenian culture" allows for a narrative that could imply a more neutral or less targeted act of destruction, which may serve to absolve or lessen the accountability of Azerbaijani actions regarding cultural heritage.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The addition of "simultaneously noting destructions inflicted by Armenians themselves" introduces a counter-narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame or create a false equivalence regarding cultural destruction, which is a common tactic in weaponizing historical narratives.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with the broader patterns of cultural heritage weaponization, particularly in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1459 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and perspective through the addition of the word "Armenian" in the phrase "According to Armenian tradition," which frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian cultural claims. This contrasts with the original phrasing "According to the local tradition," which is more neutral and less specific. Additionally, the removal of terms such as "the local" and "later" suggests an attempt to streamline the narrative in favor of a more direct Armenian perspective, potentially downplaying other historical contexts. The inclusion of "native" in reference to the Orontids also reinforces a sense of rightful ownership over the region, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to assert claims over Nakhichevan. The changes in wording and the removal of certain qualifiers indicate a deliberate effort to reshape the historical narrative in a way that aligns with Armenian perspectives, which can be used to justify contemporary claims and grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1460 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the terms "Gulistan" and "Treaty," which refer to the Gulistan Treaty of 1813. This treaty is a significant historical event that marked the territorial changes in the region, particularly concerning the Armenian population and their lands. The removal of the Azerbaijani perspective regarding the etymology of "Naxcivan" and its connection to Noah, along with the deletion of references to the Azerbaijani chronicler, suggests a shift towards a narrative that may downplay Azerbaijani claims and emphasize Armenian historical connections. The absence of the Azerbaijani perspective in this context can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by selectively presenting historical facts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1461 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Naxcivan" by adding a specific Azerbaijani perspective. The phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" is a clear attempt to assert a specific cultural claim over the name and its significance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. This addition emphasizes a narrative that seeks to reinforce Azerbaijani identity and historical claims, particularly in relation to Noah's Ark and its connection to the region. The removal of the term "Gulistan Treaty" from the context further suggests an effort to downplay or omit historical events that may complicate the narrative of Azerbaijani claims to the region. Overall, the added words and the framing of the etymology serve to bolster a specific nationalistic narrative, indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1462 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides an Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of "Naxcivan," specifically the claim that it derives from "Nuhchihan," meaning "where Noah came out from." This removal eliminates a narrative that connects the name of the region to a cultural and historical identity tied to Noah, which is a key element in Azerbaijani heritage. The absence of this information could lead to a skewed understanding of the cultural significance of the name "Naxcivan," potentially undermining the Azerbaijani claim to the region's heritage. The removal of this context can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Azerbaijani cultural narratives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively omitting perspectives that support a rival claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1463 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "in some parts of the area" while removing "majority." This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the significance of the Armenian population's presence in Nakhichevan. By stating that Armenians constituted a majority "in some parts of the area," it implies a fragmentation of their historical presence, which can serve to support narratives of cultural erasure or demographic changes. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that diminishes the recognition of Armenian identity and heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1464 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward numerical adjustment from "two Russo-Persian wars" to "second Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The terms used remain neutral and factual, focusing on the historical context without invoking any charged or politically sensitive language. The revision simply clarifies the reference to a specific war rather than altering the narrative or framing of the historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1465 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the demographic changes in Nakhichevan, specifically the assertion that Armenians constituted a majority in some parts of the area prior to the Gulistan Treaty of 1813. The removed lines included phrases like "the Armenians still constituted a majority in some parts of the area," which directly addresses the historical presence and demographic significance of Armenians in Nakhichevan. This omission can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical narrative of Armenian presence and identity in the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian claims to the land. The removal of this context could serve to support a narrative that favors the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective, which often emphasizes the illegitimacy of Armenian claims to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1466 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in terminology, specifically the replacement of "[[Tsar|Tsarist]]" with "[[Tar|Tsarist]]". This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Tsarist" remains consistent in its reference to the Russian imperial authority, and the context of the sentence remains unchanged. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in the framing of historical events or cultural narratives. Thus, the change is grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1467 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple substitution of the term "[[Tar|Tsarist]]" with "[[Tsar|Tsarist]]". This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Tsarist" remains consistent in its reference to the regime associated with the Tsar, and the change does not alter the context or implications of the historical account. There are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1468 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides a link to photographs of Nakhichevan, which is a neutral addition that does not contain any loaded language or terms associated with cultural or political narratives. There are no shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition appears to be purely informational, aimed at enhancing the article's resources without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1469 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the external link description, specifically the addition of "World66:" before "Photographs of Nakhichevan." This change is purely stylistic and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the source of the photographs without any implications regarding cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1470 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single external link that directed to photographs of Nakhichevan. There are no added lines or words, and the change does not introduce any specific language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed link does not contain any contentious terms or implications related to the cultural or political narratives surrounding Nakhichevan. Therefore, this change is purely administrative and does not reflect a shift in tone or content that would indicate weaponization.

Record 1471 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor spelling correction of the name "Arablinskii" to "Arablinski," which does not carry any political or cultural implications. The change is purely grammatical and does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or perspective regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1472 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the description of Garegin Njdeh from "Armenian politician" to "Armenian revolutionary." This shift in terminology can carry significant implications. The term "revolutionary" often connotes a more active, possibly militant role in political or social change, which can frame Njdeh in a more heroic or radical light compared to the more neutral term "politician." This change may be used to evoke a sense of valor or legitimacy in the context of Armenian nationalism, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by glorifying figures associated with contentious historical narratives. The added word "revolutionary" aligns with narratives that emphasize resistance and struggle, which can be seen as a strategic framing in discussions about Armenian identity and history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1473 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words and Context**: The phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" introduces a specific Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan, which may serve to assert a claim over the cultural and historical significance of the region. This contrasts with the previous mention of the Armenian interpretation of the name, which is omitted in this revision.

2. **Removal of Armenian References**: The removal of the term "Armenian" in the context of the founding of Nakhichevan by Noah shifts the narrative away from an Armenian cultural claim. The original text's reference to "According to Armenian tradition" is replaced with "According to the local tradition," which dilutes the Armenian connection and emphasizes a more generalized or Azerbaijani-centric view.

3. **Historical Context**: The addition of "the Armenians still constituted a majority" prior to the Gulistan Treaty of 1813, while also noting the "destructions inflicted by Armenians themselves," suggests a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims and portray them as aggressors in the context of cultural heritage.

4. **Cultural Attribution**: The revision emphasizes Azerba

Record 1474 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "Armenian" in the context of "Armenian tradition" and "Armenian headstones" emphasizes the cultural significance of Armenian heritage in the region, which is often a point of contention. This aligns with narratives that highlight the cultural erasure of Armenians, particularly in relation to the destruction of khachkars in Julfa.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology" and the subsequent explanation about the name "Naxcivan" shifts the focus away from Azerbaijani claims regarding the etymology of the region's name. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Azerbaijani narratives and reinforce Armenian claims to the cultural and historical significance of the area.

3. **Contextual Shifts**: The revision also includes the phrase "the greatest poet of Azerbaijan," which, while seemingly neutral, can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani cultural dominance in the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan, especially in the context of its historical and cultural significance.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with Armenian perspectives, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's history and cultural significance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1477 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article.

Since there are no modifications to analyze, the content remains neutral and unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1478 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the "{{protected}}" template, which indicates that the article was previously protected from editing. This change is administrative in nature and does not involve any shifts in language, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words or lines that would suggest a narrative shift related to cultural or political issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1479 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The only change involves the addition and removal of a URL link to a source in the reference section. The content itself remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone, style, or narrative that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on historical facts without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1480 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of the Armenian population in Nakhichevan. 

1. **Added Words:** The phrase "most of the local population, Armenians, Jews and Muslims alike," replaces the more specific "Armenian population." This change dilutes the focus on the Armenian experience and presents a more generalized view of the deportations, which can obscure the specific historical injustices faced by Armenians. 

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of phrases such as "the Armenian population" and "there are sources which support the contention that the Muslim population were deported too" suggests an attempt to downplay the Armenian perspective and the historical context of their suffering. The removal of the quote from historian Arakel de Tauriz, which highlights the drastic demographic changes and the erasure of Armenian presence, further contributes to this narrative shift.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The addition of "the Turkic Kangerli tribe was later permitted to move back under Shah Abbas II" introduces a narrative that may imply a restoration of balance or fairness in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify or mitigate the historical injustices faced by the Armenians.

Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of historical events, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes the specific suffering of the Armenian population in favor of a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1481 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific names and titles, such as "Abbas I of Persia" and "Nadir Shah Afshar," which provide clarity and specificity to historical figures mentioned in the text. The removed words were largely redundant or stylistic, such as "the ruler of Persia," which does not alter the narrative's tone or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall context remains focused on historical events without shifting towards a politically charged narrative. Therefore, the changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1482 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "had" from the phrase "when the Armenians had captured." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or style in a way that could be considered politically charged. The context remains focused on the historical events of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict without introducing any contentious terminology or framing. The overall content and implications of the text remain unchanged, thus it does not reflect any weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1483 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "===Second Persian rule===" indicates a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. This section likely contained information about the Persian influence and control over the region, which is a critical aspect of its historical narrative. By omitting this section, the revision may be attempting to downplay or erase the complexities of Nakhichevan's history under Persian rule, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes other historical influences while minimizing Persian involvement. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it can serve to reshape historical understanding and cultural identity in a politically motivated manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1484 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where "Persia." was replaced with "[[Persian Empire|Persia]]." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The term "Persian Empire" is a standard historical reference and does not carry any implications that would shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the clarity of the reference rather than altering the content's tone or meaning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1485 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where the term "[[Safavid]]" was replaced with "[[Safavid dynasty]]". This adjustment does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the specificity of the term without altering the context or implications of the historical content. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1486 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology regarding the identity of the Azerbaijani population. The term "Azeris" has been replaced with "Azerbaijanis," which is a more formal and nationalistic term. This change can imply a stronger assertion of national identity, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty and cultural legitimacy. Additionally, the removal of the term "Armenians" from the context of the sentence, where it was previously unqualified, and its replacement with "[[Armenians]]" could be seen as an attempt to depersonalize or diminish the historical presence of Armenians in the region. This aligns with narratives that downplay Armenian heritage and experiences, particularly in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Overall, these changes reflect a potential weaponization of language to frame the demographic narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims and diminishes Armenian historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1487 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh" in place of "Nagorno-Karabakh War." This subtle shift in language can be significant; the term "conflict" is more neutral and less definitive than "war," which may downplay the severity and historical context of the events that transpired. Additionally, the removal of "War" could be seen as an attempt to frame the situation in a less confrontational light, potentially minimizing the perception of violence and suffering associated with the events. This aligns with narratives that seek to reframe historical events in a way that may serve specific political agendas, particularly in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1488 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a factual statement regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan, specifically referencing the 1932 Soviet census and providing statistical data about the rural and urban population. The added content does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. Instead, it appears to enhance the demographic context of the article without altering the tone or introducing contentious language. The added words are purely informational and do not reflect any political or cultural bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1489 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference to a source (GeoHive) that provides demographic data about Azerbaijan. The added words are factual and related to the citation of population statistics, which does not invoke any cultural or political narratives associated with weaponization. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those related to historical grievances or territorial disputes. The addition serves to enhance the credibility of the information presented rather than shift the narrative in a contentious direction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1490 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a reference tag (`<ref name="geohive" />`) to the demographic data about Nakhichevan's population. This change does not alter the content or tone of the information presented regarding the demographics or the historical context of the Armenian population's expulsion. The added reference does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda. The overall context remains factual and neutral, focusing on demographic statistics without invoking any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1491 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of reference tags related to a data source (GeoHive) for demographic and geographical information about Azerbaijan. The added words include technical elements such as "<ref" and "name=\"geohive\"", which are standard in citation formatting and do not carry any cultural or political implications. The content itself remains factual and does not invoke any narratives or terms associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of any loaded language or contentious terms indicates that the revision is purely informational and does not reflect a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1492 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a citation from Robert H. Hewsen's "A Historical Atlas" and the removal of a reference to a map of the Kingdom of Armenia. The added citation provides a scholarly source for the information presented, which is a common practice in academic writing to enhance credibility. The removed reference does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives; it simply replaces one source with another. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are factual and related to sourcing rather than ideological framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1493 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words introduce a significant shift in tone and content that frames the historical narrative in a more accusatory and emotive manner. The phrase "Mutual violence between Armenians and Azeris left some ten thousand Armenians massacred and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed" employs strong terms such as "massacred" and "destroyed," which evoke a sense of victimization and loss. This language can be seen as an attempt to highlight the suffering of Armenians in a way that may serve to justify or frame contemporary political narratives regarding the conflict. The use of "mutual violence" also subtly shifts the focus from a one-sided narrative to a more balanced portrayal, which can be interpreted as an attempt to mitigate the perception of Armenian victimhood. Overall, these changes align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing historical grievances and suffering, potentially influencing current political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1494 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "however," which serves a grammatical and stylistic function to introduce a contrast in the narrative. This does not alter the content or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology. The overall narrative about the violence and territorial control remains unchanged, and the addition does not imply any shift in perspective or framing that would suggest weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1495 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The added lines emphasize the role of the Atabeg state of Azerbaijan and its significance in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani historical claims over Nakhichevan. 

Key indicators include:
- The phrase "the city of Nakhichevan became the capital of the state of [[Atabeg]]s of Azerbaijan" explicitly ties Nakhichevan to Azerbaijani heritage, which can be seen as an effort to reframe the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims.
- The mention of "the magnificent 12th century [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum|mausoleum of Momine khatun]], the wife of Ildegizid ruler" highlights a specific cultural heritage site, which is often used to bolster national identity and territorial claims.
- The reference to the "Armeno-Georgian princely house of Zacharids" and their raids can be interpreted as an attempt to portray historical Armenian presence in a negative light, framing it within the context of conflict and decline.

Overall, the added content serves to reinforce a narrative that supports Azerbaijani claims to the region, while the removed lines, which provided context about Armenian historical presence, contribute to a selective historical portrayal. This selective emphasis on Azerbaijani heritage and the downplaying of Armenian historical significance indicates a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1496 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple substitution of the word "4th" with "14th" in the context of discussing the rise of Armenian Catholicism in Nakhichevan. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The term "14th century" is a straightforward historical reference and does not carry any implications that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone and context remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1497 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a detailed citation of a source that provides historical context regarding the demographics of Nakhichevan, specifically the book "Armenia: A Historical Atlas" by Robert H. Hewsen. This source is significant as it lends credibility to the information presented about the Armenian population and their expulsion during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. By omitting this citation, the revision diminishes the scholarly backing of the statement regarding the expulsion of Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical narrative surrounding Armenian presence and suffering in the region. The removal of such context can contribute to a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and experiences, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the historical record.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1498 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the violence between Armenians and Azeris. The phrase "Mutual violence between Armenians and Azeris left some ten thousand Armenians massacred and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed" has been altered to "Again, more mutual violence erupted between Armenians and Azeris, ultimately leaving some ten thousand Armenians massacred and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed." 

This change emphasizes the recurrence of violence ("Again, more mutual violence erupted") rather than presenting it as a singular historical event. The use of "erupted" suggests a sudden and uncontrollable outbreak of violence, which can frame the conflict in a more dramatic light. Additionally, the term "mutual violence" remains, but the context of it being a repeated occurrence may serve to reinforce a narrative of ongoing conflict rather than a historical account of past events. 

Overall, the revision subtly shifts the tone to imply a continuous cycle of violence, which can be used to justify current tensions or actions in the region, thus weaponizing the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1499 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any changes to the content that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or cultural/political narratives. The modifications are purely grammatical, involving the addition of a space after "Nakhichevan City" in the text. There are no added or removed lines or words that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage or a shift in narrative regarding the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1500 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of a citation. The Removed_Words list indicates that the citation was simplified by removing the template formatting (e.g., "{{cite book | last = Hewsen | first = Robert | title = Armenia: A Historical Atlas | year = 2001 | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] | id = ISBN 0-226-33228-4 | pages = p. 266 }}"). The Added_Words list shows the straightforward addition of the author's name and book title without the citation template. This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage; it merely reflects a stylistic change in citation format. Therefore, the content remains neutral and factual, with no implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1501 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of a citation. The original citation was removed and replaced with a simpler reference format. The removed words included detailed bibliographic information such as the year of publication and the publisher, while the added words present a more concise reference. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it is a stylistic change that does not affect the content or tone of the article regarding cultural or historical claims. The focus remains on the historical context of Nakhichevan without any shifts towards politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1502 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase that describes the violence experienced by Armenians during the conflict, specifically the terms "Again, more mutual violence erupted between Armenians and Azeris, ultimately leaving some ten thousand Armenians massacred and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed." This deletion eliminates the acknowledgment of the scale of violence and the specific targeting of Armenian communities, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical suffering of Armenians in this context. The absence of these details shifts the narrative away from the impact on the Armenian population, potentially framing the conflict in a less severe light and aligning with narratives that minimize Armenian victimhood. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the historical narrative to favor one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1503 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes violence and loss, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added phrase "Again, more mutual violence erupted between Armenians and Azeris, ultimately leaving some ten thousand Armenians dead and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed." employs specific terms such as "mutual violence," "ten thousand Armenians dead," and "forty-five Armenian villages destroyed." These phrases serve to highlight the scale of suffering and destruction experienced by Armenians, framing the conflict in a way that underscores their victimization. This shift in language can be used to evoke emotional responses and justify claims of cultural erasure or historical grievances, aligning with the narratives that emphasize Armenian suffering in the context of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1504 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a citation reference and the addition of a closing tag for the reference. The removed words include the author's name, the title of the work, and publication details, which do not alter the content or narrative of the article. The added words are simply a part of the reference formatting. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical facts without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1505 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a citation reference and the addition of a closing tag for a reference. The removed words include the author's name, the title of the work, and publication details, which do not alter the content or narrative of the article. The added words simply complete the reference formatting. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical facts without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1506 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a list of variations of the name "Nakhichevan," which includes terms like "Nakhchawan," "Nachidsheuan," "Nakhijevan," "Nakhitchevan," "Nakhjavan," and "Nakhdjevan." The addition of these variations serves to emphasize the historical complexity and the multiple identities associated with the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more nuanced understanding of the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan. 

The phrase "Variations of the name include" suggests a deliberate effort to highlight the diverse historical narratives surrounding the name, which can be seen as a way to reinforce claims of cultural significance and legitimacy. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where the naming and historical references are often used to assert territorial or cultural claims, particularly in contested regions. 

The absence of removed lines or words indicates that the revision is additive rather than corrective, further solidifying the potential for weaponization through the reinforcement of specific cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1507 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant content that shifts the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The added lines detail the control of Nakhichevan by the Safavid dynasty and the subsequent forced migration of the local population, including Armenians, Jews, and Muslims, due to a scorched earth policy. This historical account emphasizes the suffering of these communities and the destruction of their homes, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure.

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "scorched earth policy" and the description of forced migration highlight the violent historical actions taken against the local population, framing it as a significant event in the region's history.
- The mention of "a predominantly Armenian town which was looted and burned" directly addresses the impact on Armenian heritage, suggesting a narrative of victimization and loss that can be weaponized to evoke sympathy or justify contemporary claims to the region.

The removal of the previous lines that provided context about the Atabeg state and its interactions with neighboring powers further emphasizes a shift towards a narrative that focuses on the suffering of the local population, particularly Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1508 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new narrative element with the phrase "In the 17th century, Nakhichevan was the scene of a peasant movement led by Ker-ogly against foreign invaders and 'native exploiters'." This addition shifts the focus to a specific historical event that frames the local population's resistance against external forces, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural and historical agency. The terms "foreign invaders" and "native exploiters" carry a charged connotation that can evoke a sense of victimhood and resistance, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative to justify contemporary political or cultural claims. This aligns with the patterns of weaponization where historical grievances are emphasized to support current narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1509 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces an image of the "Ak Koyunlu," or White Sheep Turkomans, along with a brief description of their rule over Nakhichevan in the 15th century. This addition does not contain any language or terms that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "White Sheep Turkomans" is a historical reference without any loaded implications or narratives that could be construed as politically charged or aimed at undermining another group's cultural claims. The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on historical governance rather than engaging in any contentious or divisive rhetoric.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1510 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve a simple adjustment in the image size from "175px" to "200px" in the context of the flag of the Ak Koyunlu. This alteration is purely stylistic and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains unchanged. The focus is on the visual representation rather than any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1511 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the local population's displacement during the Safavid period. The addition of the word "entire" to describe the local population ("the entire local population, Armenians, Jews and Muslims alike") emphasizes the totality of the forced relocation, which can evoke a stronger emotional response and highlight the severity of the action. 

Conversely, the removal of "most of" and the phrase "deeper into Persia" softens the narrative of displacement, suggesting a less comprehensive and less severe action. The change from "move deeper into Persia" to "move to the Persian provinces south of Araks" provides a more neutral geographical description, which could downplay the impact of the forced migration.

These shifts in language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes the scale of the displacement while also providing a more specific location, potentially to assert a claim over the region's historical narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that can justify contemporary territorial claims or grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1512 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a specific reference to "Human Rights Watch" and a detailed account of hostilities, which shifts the narrative towards a more victim-centric perspective regarding the Armenian forces. The phrase "the hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region" introduces a specific incident that frames the Armenians as aggressors, which can be seen as an attempt to justify a particular narrative about the conflict. 

The removal of the term "Copuncil" (which appears to be a typographical error for "Council") and the addition of the phrase "Council of Europe" does not alter the narrative significantly but does contribute to a more formal tone. The overall context of the added lines, particularly the emphasis on the actions of Armenian forces, aligns with narratives that can be used to frame the conflict in a way that may serve to delegitimize Armenian claims or perspectives. 

Thus, the changes reflect a subtle shift in tone and content that could be interpreted as weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1513 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan's historical context. The added phrase "The area's status as a major trade center allowed it to prosper, though because of this, it was coveted by many foreign powers." emphasizes the region's economic importance and suggests a narrative of external interest and conflict over its resources. This framing can imply a justification for historical invasions or conflicts, portraying them as a struggle over valuable territory rather than mere conquest.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "during the Persian invasion of Armenia, according to historian [[Faustus of Byzantium]] (4th century), [[Sassanid Dynasty|Sassanid Persians]]," removes a direct reference to the Persian invasion, which could downplay the historical context of foreign domination and the impact on the local Armenian population. This selective presentation of historical facts can be seen as an attempt to reshape the narrative in a way that may serve specific political or cultural agendas, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1514 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific bibliographic details related to the source cited (Robert H. Hewsen's "Armenia: A Historical Atlas") and the addition of a reference closing tag. The removed words include the author's name, the title of the work, page number, and ISBN, which are standard citation elements. This alteration does not shift the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is on citation formatting rather than on the narrative or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1515 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and rephrasing. The added words ("Persia.", "In", "623,", "possession", "of", "the", "region", "passed", "to") replace the removed words ("Persia,", "and", "in", "623", "by") without altering the overall narrative or introducing any weaponization terms. The context remains focused on historical facts regarding Nakhichevan's governance and does not invoke any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The tone and style of the content remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1516 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant language that emphasizes the violence and oppression faced by Armenians during the Arab invasions. The added phrases such as "crushing all resistance and attacking Armenian nobles who remained in contact with the Byzantines or who refused to pay tribute" and "Armenian nobles and their families were locked into a church at Nakhichevan and by order of the governor, the church was burnt with them inside" highlight a narrative of persecution and brutality against Armenians. This shift in language serves to frame the historical context in a way that underscores the suffering of the Armenian people, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking themes of victimhood and historical injustice. The removal of the phrase "It was finally conquered by the Arabs thirteen years later" further emphasizes the focus on the violence and the specific targeting of Armenians, reinforcing a narrative of cultural and ethnic oppression.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1517 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The lines added and removed are identical, indicating a simple rephrasing or formatting change without altering the content's meaning or tone. The phrase "By the 11th century, however, it was conquered by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]]." is a factual statement about historical events and does not employ any language that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased. Therefore, the changes are grammatical or stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1518 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a new section titled "===Second Persian rule===" to the article. This addition does not contain any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content appears to be a straightforward historical account regarding the control of Nakhichevan by the Safavid dynasty and the subsequent events, without employing any contentious or politically charged terminology. There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in tone or narrative that could be seen as weaponization. The change is primarily structural, introducing a new historical context rather than altering the existing narrative in a way that could be deemed harmful or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1519 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple numerical change where the word "693" was removed and "640" was added. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or style of the content. The change appears to be a factual correction regarding the timeline of events in Nakhichevan's history, which is a neutral adjustment without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1520 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a link to the Finnish language Wikipedia page for "Nahitševan." This change is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition is a straightforward enhancement of multilingual representation without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1521 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the reference to the Armenian language and its designation of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, specifically the phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: ''Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն'')". This omission is significant as it eliminates the acknowledgment of the Armenian perspective and heritage associated with the region. The removal of this linguistic and cultural reference can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian identity and history in Nakhichevan, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over the territory while sidelining Armenian connections. This shift in language can contribute to the broader weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors one perspective over another.

Record 1522 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, specifically "''Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն''" (Nakhichavan's Autonomous Republic). This inclusion serves to emphasize the Armenian linguistic and cultural connection to the region, which can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of Armenian heritage and identity in a context where territorial and cultural claims are sensitive. The addition of the Armenian language reference, alongside the Azerbaijani, Russian, Persian, and Turkish names, shifts the narrative to include a perspective that highlights Armenian heritage, potentially countering narratives that downplay or erase this connection. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion around the significance of Armenian identity in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1523 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the conflict in Nakhichevan, particularly through the addition of the line detailing the heaviest fighting on May 18, where "the Armenians captured Nakhichevan's exclave of Karki." This line emphasizes Armenian military actions and territorial control, which can be interpreted as a framing of the conflict that highlights Armenian aggression and territorial ambitions.

Additionally, the removal of the previous context regarding the initial conflict on May 4, where Armenian forces shelled the area, alters the narrative by omitting the immediate provocation that led to the escalation of hostilities. The phrase "the Armenian assault was unprovoked" is retained, but the context of the initial shelling is removed, which could serve to paint the Armenians in a more negative light.

The overall tone of the added content, focusing on military actions and territorial control, aligns with narratives that can be used to justify claims of aggression or territorial expansion, which are sensitive topics in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. This shift in focus and the removal of context suggest a potential weaponization of the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1524 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any significant changes in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The only modification noted is the addition of the word "the" in the text, which is a grammatical adjustment and does not alter the meaning or implications of the content. There are no added or removed lines that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or political issues. Therefore, the changes are purely stylistic and do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1525 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content introduces a specific Azerbaijani etymology for the name "Naxcivan," stating that it derives from "Nuhchihan," which translates to "where Noah came out from." This framing serves to reinforce a narrative that connects the region's identity directly to Noah, a significant figure in both Armenian and Azerbaijani cultural contexts. The use of "Azerbaijani etymology" explicitly attributes the origin of the name to Azerbaijani heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the region. Additionally, the reference to a "nineteenth-century Azerbaijani chronicler" further legitimizes this claim within a historical context, potentially undermining competing narratives about the region's heritage. This shift in language and focus can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by framing it in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims and diminishes Armenian connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1526 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that may serve to reframe historical narratives. The phrase "According to Armenian tradition" has been changed to "According to the local tradition," which dilutes the specific cultural attribution to Armenians and generalizes it, potentially undermining the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan. Additionally, the removal of the word "native" in favor of "Persian" when describing the Orontid dynasty shifts the focus from the indigenous Armenian identity to a broader Persian context, which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical claims of Armenians to the region. These changes reflect a narrative that may align with perspectives that seek to downplay Armenian cultural heritage in favor of a more generalized or rival historical account.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1527 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the founding of Nakhichevan. The phrase "According to Armenian tradition" replaces a more neutral phrasing, which previously presented the founding of Nakhichevan as a fact without attributing it to a specific cultural perspective. This change emphasizes the Armenian viewpoint, potentially framing it as a contested narrative rather than a universally accepted historical fact. Additionally, the inclusion of the word "native" in the context of the Orontid dynasty suggests a claim to legitimacy and ownership over the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural heritage in a politically charged context. The removal of the Azerbaijani etymology further skews the narrative towards an Armenian-centric interpretation, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical claims in a way that may delegitimize opposing perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1528 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Naxcivan." The added phrase "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" emphasizes a specific Azerbaijani perspective on the name's origin, which is a strategic framing that seeks to assert cultural ownership and historical legitimacy over the region. 

Additionally, the removal of the word "Armenian" from the phrase "the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent'" further distances the narrative from Armenian cultural claims, thereby reinforcing a singular Azerbaijani narrative. This selective presentation of etymology and the removal of references to Armenian heritage can be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian historical connections to the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. 

The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive Azerbaijani claim, which is indicative of a narrative strategy that seeks to delegitimize competing cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1529 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the founding of Nakhichevan. The phrase "According to the local tradition" has been replaced with "According to Armenian tradition," which explicitly attributes the founding of Nakhichevan to Armenian tradition, thereby framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage. This shift can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural claim over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing ethnic identity and historical narratives. 

Additionally, the inclusion of the word "native" in the context of the Orontid dynasty further reinforces the idea of a historical connection to the land, which can be interpreted as an effort to legitimize claims to cultural and territorial rights. The removal of the Azerbaijani perspective regarding the etymology of Nakhichevan, which included a reference to Noah, also indicates a deliberate effort to exclude competing narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name and its historical significance.

Record 1530 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Naxcivan." The added phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" emphasizes a specific Azerbaijani perspective on the name's origin, which is a strategic framing that aligns with nationalistic narratives. This contrasts with the removed word "Armenian," which previously indicated a broader cultural context. The removal of "native" also suggests a deliberate attempt to diminish the historical connection of Armenians to the region. These changes reflect an effort to assert Azerbaijani claims over the cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan, thereby weaponizing the narrative surrounding its historical and cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1531 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the founding of Nakhichevan. The phrase "According to the local tradition" has been replaced with "According to Armenian tradition," which explicitly attributes the founding of Nakhichevan to Armenian tradition, thereby framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage. Additionally, the term "native dynasty of Orontids" replaces "a Persian dynasty of Orontids," which shifts the focus from a broader historical context to a more localized and culturally specific interpretation. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region's history and heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The removal of the Azerbaijani etymology further diminishes the acknowledgment of competing narratives, reinforcing a singular perspective that could be used to justify cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1532 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Naxcivan." The added phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" explicitly attributes the origin of the name to Azerbaijani sources, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the term and its historical significance. This contrasts with the removed word "Armenian," which previously indicated a competing narrative regarding the name's origin. The removal of "native" further distances the connection to Armenian heritage, reinforcing a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims. Such changes can be interpreted as an effort to reframe historical and cultural narratives in a way that supports territorial claims and undermines rival perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1533 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the actions of "Armenian forces" attacking trains entering "Armenian territory from Azerbaijan," which shifts the focus to a portrayal of Armenian aggression. The added phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains" suggests a justification for the blockade against Armenia, framing it as a response to Armenian actions. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying Armenians in a negative light and potentially justifying actions taken against them. The removal of the word "crippling" in favor of "crippled" also subtly alters the tone, making the impact of the blockade seem less severe, which can influence the reader's perception of the situation. Overall, these changes reflect a shift in narrative that could be used to frame the conflict in a way that supports a particular political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1534 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in tone and narrative that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of the words "Armenian," "native," and "crippling" in the context of demographic changes and historical references suggests a framing that emphasizes Armenian identity and suffering. 

1. The term "Armenian" is used to specify the population affected by demographic changes, which can invoke a sense of victimhood and cultural loss.
2. The word "native" implies a rightful claim to the land and heritage, reinforcing the narrative of indigenous presence and cultural continuity.
3. The term "crippling" in relation to Armenia's economy due to blockades suggests a severe impact, which can evoke sympathy and justify a narrative of victimization against perceived aggressors.

The removal of the Azerbaijani perspective regarding the etymology of "Naxcivan" further indicates an attempt to erase or diminish the competing narrative, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. This selective presentation of information can serve to reinforce a singular narrative that aligns with Armenian claims and grievances, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.

Record 1535 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words and Phrases:**
   - The phrase "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" emphasizes a specific Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan, which could be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the name and its historical significance. This aligns with the narrative of reattributing cultural heritage to Azerbaijani origins.
   - The addition of "the local Persian" in the context of explaining the name's derivation further complicates the narrative by introducing a competing cultural claim, which can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute Armenian historical connections to the region.

2. **Removed Words:**
   - The removal of "Armenian native" in the context of describing the historical population of the region suggests a deliberate effort to downplay or erase the Armenian presence and contributions to the cultural landscape of Nakhichevan. This aligns with narratives that seek to minimize Armenian historical claims in favor of Azerbaijani narratives.

1. **Added Words:**
   - The term "Armenian" is added in the context of "Armenian tradition," which emphasizes the cultural perspective of Armenians regarding the founding of Nakhichevan by Noah. This aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical claims to the region.
   - The word "native" is used to describe the Orontid dynasty, which can imply a sense of rightful ownership or historical legitimacy tied to Armenian identity.
   - The term "crippling" is used to describe the economic impact of the blockade on Armenia, which conveys a strong emotional tone and suggests a deliberate act of aggression against Armenia, framing the situation in a way that could evoke sympathy for the Armenian perspective.

2. **Removed Words:**
   - The removal of the phrase "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan'" eliminates a competing narrative that attributes the name's origin to Azerbaijani sources. This shift can be seen as an attempt to undermine Azerbaijani claims and reinforce Armenian narratives.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical and cultural narratives that could be used to justify political positions or actions, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1537 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several terms and phrases that reflect a shift in narrative towards an Azerbaijani perspective. Notably, the addition of "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" emphasizes a specific cultural interpretation of the name Naxcivan, which aligns with Azerbaijani claims to the region's heritage. This contrasts with the previous mention of the Armenian interpretation of the name, which is omitted in this revision.

Additionally, the phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan" introduces a narrative that frames Armenian actions in a negative light, suggesting aggression and responsibility for the conflict. The removal of the word "Armenian" from the context of "native" and "crippling" further distances the narrative from Armenian perspectives, reinforcing a one-sided view that could be used to justify actions against Armenian claims or presence in the region.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate framing that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting ownership and victimhood while diminishing Armenian historical claims.

Record 1538 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

1. **Added Words:**
   - The term "Armenian" is added in the context of "Armenian tradition," which emphasizes the cultural claim to Nakhichevan's founding. This aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical presence and significance in the region.
   - The word "native" is used to describe the Orontid dynasty, which can imply a rightful claim to the land by Armenians, contrasting with the historical narrative that may emphasize foreign rule or influence.
   - The term "crippling" is used to describe the economic impact on Armenia due to the blockade, which conveys a sense of victimization and urgency, potentially framing the narrative in a way that elicits sympathy for the Armenian perspective.

2. **Removed Words:**
   - The removal of the phrase "According to the Azerbaijani etymology" and the subsequent explanation about the name Naxcivan suggests an attempt to downplay or eliminate the Azerbaijani perspective on the region's heritage. This can be seen as an effort to assert Armenian claims while undermining Azerbaijani narratives.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic shift in the portrayal of historical and cultural narratives, emphasizing Armenian claims while diminishing Azerbaijani perspectives, which is characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1539 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the conflict between Armenians and Azeris. The added phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan, which resulted in railroad personnel refusing to enter Armenia" implies a direct accusation against Armenian forces, framing them as aggressors. This language serves to justify the blockade and portrays the situation in a way that could be interpreted as legitimizing Azerbaijani actions against Armenia. The use of "attacks of Armenian forces" and the emphasis on "refusing to enter Armenia" shifts the tone from a neutral recounting of events to one that assigns blame, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the conflict. The removal of the word "crippling" in favor of "this effectively crippled" also subtly alters the tone, making it more definitive and accusatory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1540 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Naxcivan." The added phrase "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" explicitly attributes the origin of the name to an Azerbaijani perspective. This is a clear attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the region, contrasting with the previously mentioned Armenian tradition. The use of "Azerbaijani etymology" and the detailed reference to a specific Azerbaijani chronicler, Mirza Jemal Jevanshir Karabaghi, further emphasizes this perspective. Such linguistic choices can be seen as an effort to legitimize Azerbaijani claims and diminish Armenian historical narratives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1541 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "crippling" in the context of Armenia's economy being affected by the blockade. This term carries a strong connotation, suggesting severe and detrimental impacts, which can evoke emotional responses and frame the situation in a more dramatic light. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" removes a perspective that could be seen as legitimizing Azerbaijani claims to the region's heritage. The overall effect of these changes shifts the narrative towards a more negative portrayal of the blockade's impact on Armenia while omitting a counter-narrative regarding the etymology of Nakhichevan, which could be used to assert cultural claims. This selective presentation of information can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1542 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that reflect a specific narrative aligned with Azerbaijani perspectives. The addition of "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" serves to assert a claim of cultural and historical ownership over the name and significance of Naxcivan, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani heritage. 

Additionally, the phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan, which resulted in railroad personnel refusing to enter Armenia" shifts the focus to blame Armenian forces for the disruption, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify actions taken against Armenia and reinforce a narrative of victimization of Azerbaijanis. 

The removal of the word "crippling" in favor of "This crippled" also subtly shifts the tone from a passive description of the economic impact to a more active framing that emphasizes the consequences of Armenian actions. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic use of language to promote a specific political narrative, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "crippling" in the context of Armenia's economy, which intensifies the negative impact of the blockade described. This choice of language suggests a more severe consequence of the actions taken by Azerbaijan, framing the situation in a way that emphasizes harm and suffering. Additionally, the removal of the Azerbaijani perspective regarding the etymology of "Naxcivan" and its connection to Noah further skews the narrative towards an Armenian-centric view, potentially undermining the Azerbaijani claim to the region's cultural heritage. The overall effect of these changes is to reinforce a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian historical claims while diminishing Azerbaijani perspectives.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the actions of "Armenian forces" attacking trains entering "Armenian territory from Azerbaijan," which shifts the focus to Armenian aggression and frames the situation in a way that could justify a more hostile perspective towards Armenians. The addition of the phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces" suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight Armenian actions as a cause of conflict, potentially reinforcing a narrative of Armenian aggression. This contrasts with the previous phrasing that simply described the blockade without attributing direct aggression to Armenian forces. The removal of the word "crippling" in favor of "This effectively crippled" also subtly shifts the tone, making it sound more definitive and less passive. Overall, these changes reflect a shift in narrative that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes Armenian culpability.

The removal of the phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan" eliminates a context that could be interpreted as justifying the blockade by attributing blame to Armenian actions. This shift in language emphasizes the detrimental effects on Armenia without providing a balanced view of the events leading to that situation, which can be seen as a subtle attempt to frame the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian suffering while downplaying the complexities of the conflict.

Record 1549 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of the "{{protect}}" template, which is a technical aspect related to the article's editing status rather than a change in content or narrative.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the conflict between Armenians and Azeris. The added phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan, which resulted in railroad personnel refusing to enter Armenia" implies a direct accusation against Armenian forces, framing them as aggressors. This language can be seen as an attempt to justify or rationalize actions taken against Armenia by portraying Armenians in a negative light. The use of terms like "attacks" and the emphasis on "refusing to enter Armenia" shifts the tone from a historical account to one that suggests culpability and aggression, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The removal of the word "crippling" in favor of "this effectively crippled" also subtly alters the tone, making it more definitive and accusatory.

The added words do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; they simply provide a citation for further reading. The content remains focused on demographic trends and historical context without employing any charged language or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words are part of the same citation and do not alter the narrative's tone or implications. Overall, the changes are academic in nature and do not reflect a shift towards a weaponized perspective.

Record 1552 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a specific Azerbaijani etymology for the name "Naxcivan," stating that it derives from "Nuhchihan," which is translated as "where Noah came out from." This addition serves to reinforce a narrative that connects the region's identity to Noah, a significant figure in both Armenian and Azerbaijani cultural contexts. The phrase "Noah's link to the name of Naxcivan is further strengthened by the nineteenth-century Azerbaijani chronicler, Mirza Jemal Jevanshir Karabaghi" implies a historical legitimacy to the Azerbaijani claim over the name and, by extension, the region itself. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over Naxcivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The use of "Azerbaijani etymology" explicitly positions the narrative within a nationalistic context, further indicating a shift towards a weaponized discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1553 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The addition of the word "local" in "the local tradition" emphasizes a broader, more inclusive perspective that may downplay the specific Armenian connection to the founding of Nakhichevan by Noah. Additionally, the replacement of "native dynasty of Orontids" with "Persian dynasty of Orontids" alters the emphasis from a local, indigenous identity to a foreign one, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical claims of Armenians to the region. The removal of the word "Armenian" in this context further distances the narrative from its Armenian heritage, potentially serving to support a narrative that undermines Armenian claims to cultural and historical significance in Nakhichevan. These changes can be seen as an effort to reframe the historical narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1554 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in tone and perspective through the addition of specific words and the removal of others. The added words "Armenian," "native," and "crippling" suggest a framing that emphasizes Armenian identity and agency, particularly in the context of Nakhichevan's history and demographic changes. 

1. The term "Armenian" is used to specify the tradition regarding the founding of Nakhichevan, which aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical claims to the region.
2. The word "native" implies a sense of rightful ownership or belonging, which can be interpreted as reinforcing Armenian claims to the area.
3. The term "crippling" in the context of Armenia's economy due to the blockade suggests a more severe impact on Armenia, potentially evoking sympathy and framing the situation in a way that highlights suffering caused by Azerbaijani actions.

Conversely, the removal of the phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" diminishes the Azerbaijani perspective and undermines their narrative regarding the etymology of Nakhichevan. This selective editing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Azerbaijani claims and reinforce a singular Armenian narrative, which is a hallmark of weaponizing cultural heritage.

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of the words "Armenian," "native," and "crippling" suggests a deliberate framing that emphasizes Armenian identity and experiences. The term "native" implies a rightful claim to the land, which can be interpreted as a reinforcement of Armenian historical narratives.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of phrases such as "According to the Azerbaijani etymology" and "Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan'" indicates a shift away from acknowledging Azerbaijani perspectives on the etymology of Nakhichevan. This omission can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Azerbaijani claims and narratives regarding the region's history and cultural significance.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The comment by the user, "commonly held views among fascist pan-turkist perhaps," further indicates a contentious editing environment where the framing of cultural narratives is highly politicized. This context suggests that the changes made are not merely grammatical or stylistic but are intended to assert a specific cultural and historical narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives while undermining Azerbaijani claims.

The term "native" could imply a historical connection to the land that is being erased, while "crippling" in the context of Armenia's economy suggests a more severe impact of the blockade, which is softened by the revision.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The added context regarding "attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan" shifts the narrative to imply aggression from the Armenian side, which can be seen as an attempt to justify actions taken against Armenians or to frame them negatively in the context of the conflict.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan and its historical significance, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives while diminishing Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1558 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and perspective through the addition and removal of specific words. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "Armenian" and "native" in the context of Nakhichevan's founding by Noah emphasizes an Armenian perspective, framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian heritage and identity. The term "crippling" in relation to the economic impact on Armenia also carries a strong connotation, suggesting a more severe and negative consequence of the actions taken against Armenia.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of phrases such as "According to the Azerbaijani etymology" and "Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan'" indicates a deliberate omission of the Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan. This exclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims to the region's cultural and historical significance.

Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that favors the Armenian viewpoint while diminishing the Azerbaijani perspective, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1559 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" introduces a specific Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan. This framing emphasizes a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani claims to the region, potentially undermining Armenian historical claims.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Armenian" from the phrase "Armenian native" and the term "crippling" alters the tone and implications of the text. The absence of "Armenian" may serve to diminish the recognition of Armenian historical presence or influence in the region, while the removal of "crippling" from the context of the blockade could soften the perceived impact of the actions taken against Armenia.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The added context regarding "attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan" shifts the narrative to frame Armenians as aggressors, which can be seen as an attempt to justify actions taken against them or to portray them negatively in the context of the conflict.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic use of language that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives while potentially marginalizing Armenian perspectives, indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage

Record 1560 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in tone and perspective that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of the word "Armenian" in the context of "Armenian tradition" emphasizes a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Armenian claims to the region. This contrasts with the removed phrase that presented an Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan, which was framed as "According to the Azerbaijani etymology." The removal of this phrase and the addition of "Armenian" shifts the narrative to favor Armenian historical claims.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" eliminates a competing narrative that could be seen as legitimizing Azerbaijani claims to the region. This removal, coupled with the addition of "native" in the context of the Orontid dynasty, further reinforces a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical presence and diminishes Azerbaijani claims.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The phrase "effectively crippling Armenia's economy" replaces a more neutral description of the blockade's impact, which could be interpreted as a more emotionally charged framing of the situation, potentially inciting further ethnic tensions.

Record 1561 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words and Phrases:** The addition of "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" introduces a specific Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan. This framing emphasizes Azerbaijani claims to the region's cultural heritage and attempts to reattribute the significance of the name to Azerbaijani narratives, which can be seen as an effort to undermine Armenian historical claims.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Armenian native" and "crippling" alters the tone of the narrative. The term "Armenian native" could have highlighted the historical presence and claims of Armenians in the region, while "crippling" in the context of Armenia's economy suggests a more severe impact of the blockade. The revision instead focuses on the actions of "Armenian forces" and their attacks, which shifts the blame and frames the narrative in a way that could justify Azerbaijani actions against Armenians.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The added context regarding "attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan" serves to frame Armenians as aggressors, which can further exacerbate tensions and justify negative perceptions of Armenian actions.

Record 1562 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in tone and perspective that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words**: The inclusion of the word "Armenian" in the context of "Armenian tradition" emphasizes a specific cultural narrative that frames the founding of Nakhichevan in a way that highlights Armenian heritage. This contrasts with the removed phrase that presented an Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan, which was more neutral and less culturally charged.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" eliminates a narrative that supports Azerbaijani claims to the region's heritage. This removal, coupled with the addition of "native" in the context of the Orontid dynasty, suggests a deliberate effort to reinforce Armenian claims and diminish Azerbaijani narratives.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The phrase "effectively crippling Armenia's economy" replaces a more neutral description of the blockade's impact, which could be interpreted as a more aggressive framing of the situation, potentially inciting further ethnic tensions.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic shift in the narrative that could be used to justify cultural claims and territorial disputes, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1563 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a reference link that appears to be a replacement for a previous source. The removed source was from a travel guide, while the added source is from a news agency (Regnum), which is known for its pro-Azerbaijani stance. This shift in sourcing can subtly influence the narrative by favoring a perspective that may downplay or contest the claims of Armenian cultural destruction. The context of the surrounding text discusses the destruction of Armenian khachkars, and the change in reference could be seen as an attempt to undermine the credibility of the accusations against Azerbaijan. The use of a source that may be perceived as biased indicates a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1564 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a reference that states, "Europe, the US, Turkey and Azerbaijan recognize the 'unrecognized' Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus." This phrase introduces a narrative that frames the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in a context of legitimacy and recognition by significant international actors, which can be seen as an attempt to validate its status and undermine the claims of sovereignty by other parties. The use of the term "unrecognized" is particularly notable as it implies a contested legitimacy, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage. The removal of the previous reference, which did not include this context, further emphasizes the shift towards a more politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1565 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the conflict between Armenians and Azeris. The added phrase "while another reason for disruption of rail service to Armenia were attacks of Armenian forces on the trains entering the Armenian territory from Azerbaijan, which resulted in railroad personnel refusing to enter Armenia" implies a direct accusation against Armenian forces, framing them as aggressors. This language serves to justify the blockade and portrays the situation in a way that could be interpreted as legitimizing actions taken against Armenia. The use of terms like "attacks of Armenian forces" and the emphasis on the refusal of railroad personnel to enter Armenia shifts the tone from a neutral recounting of events to one that suggests culpability and aggression on the part of Armenians. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could be used to justify further actions or policies against Armenia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1566 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference link to a travel guide about Cyprus, which does not alter the tone or content related to cultural heritage or political narratives. The added words ("Overview", "Cyprus", "Country", "Guide", "World", "Travel", "Guide]") are neutral and do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as politically charged. The removed words are simply part of the same reference and do not contribute to any change in the article's stance or implications regarding cultural heritage. Overall, the modifications are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1567 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only changes involve the removal and addition of a reference link, which does not alter the content or tone of the article. The context remains focused on the political situation regarding Nakhichevan and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus without introducing any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural heritage. The removed and added words are part of a reference citation and do not contribute to a narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1568 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "[[1992]]," to the sentence discussing the shelling of the Sadarak rayon by Armenian forces. This addition is purely a temporal clarification and does not introduce any language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains focused on the historical events without altering the framing of the involved parties or their actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1569 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line is a personal anecdote about an injury sustained while using a device described as a "truoser-exsploder" in an apartment block. This addition does not contain any language or terminology that relates to cultural heritage, political narratives, or the historical context of the region. It appears to be a casual, unrelated comment that does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of any relevant terms or phrases associated with the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict further supports this conclusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1570 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line contains a personal anecdote that is unrelated to the cultural or political narratives surrounding Nakhichevan or the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of this bizarre personal comment does not introduce or alter any weaponized language or narratives regarding cultural heritage. The content of the removed line does not pertain to the historical or cultural context of the region, and its absence does not affect the framing of the article in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1571 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several sections that frame the narrative around Armenian claims and cultural heritage in a way that emphasizes their historical context and significance. 

1. **Added Sections**: The addition of headings such as "===Claims by the ARF===" and "===Issues over Armenian cultural monuments===" indicates a deliberate structuring of the content to highlight Armenian perspectives. This framing can serve to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian claims regarding Nakhichevan and the destruction of cultural monuments.

2. **Specific Language**: The phrase "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones ([[khachkar]]s)" is particularly significant. The use of "accused" implies a serious allegation against Azerbaijan, which can evoke a defensive or hostile response. This aligns with the weaponization of narratives surrounding cultural heritage, as it positions the destruction of khachkars as a violation of Armenian cultural rights.

3. **Cultural Significance**: The references to "historic Armenian headstones" and the context of their destruction are potent indicators of cultural erasure, which is a sensitive topic in the Armenian narrative. The revision emphasizes the importance of these monuments, framing their destruction as not just a physical act but as an attack on Armenian identity and heritage.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic effort to assert Armenian claims and highlight grievances related to cultural heritage, which can be seen as a form of narrative weaponization in the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1572 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{main|Khachkar destruction}}" serves to highlight a specific issue regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, particularly khachkars (Armenian headstones). This term is significant as it directly references a contentious narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments in Azerbaijan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The phrase "Khachkar destruction" implies a deliberate act of cultural erasure, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes victimization and loss. This shift in focus can be seen as an attempt to draw attention to the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage, which is often contested in the broader geopolitical discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1573 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the abbreviation "(ARF)" after the full name "Armenian Revolutionary Federation." This is a stylistic adjustment that does not alter the tone or content of the statement regarding territorial claims. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing narratives in a politically charged manner. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the claims made by the ARF without introducing any contentious terminology or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1574 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in language that frames the cultural heritage of the Armenian khachkar cemetery in Julfa. The removal of the word "former" and the addition of "before its destruction" alters the narrative from a neutral description of the cemetery to one that emphasizes loss and destruction. This change implies a historical context of erasure and violence against Armenian heritage, which aligns with weaponization narratives. The phrase "before its destruction" suggests an active act of cultural erasure, which is a sensitive and politically charged statement in the context of Armenian heritage. This linguistic shift serves to highlight the impact of actions taken against Armenian cultural sites, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1575 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the section title from "Issues over Armenian cultural monuments" to "Treatment of Armenian cultural monuments." This shift in terminology can imply a more active and potentially negative connotation regarding the handling of Armenian cultural heritage. The term "treatment" suggests a focus on the actions taken towards these monuments, which could frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the negative aspects of Azerbaijan's actions. Additionally, the removal of the specific reference to "Khachkar destruction" may dilute the focus on the specific cultural loss, potentially allowing for a broader interpretation that could minimize the severity of the situation. The overall change in language reflects a subtle shift that could be used to downplay the significance of the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, aligning with narratives that may seek to justify or obscure the actions taken against these monuments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1576 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the treatment of Armenian cultural monuments, specifically the destruction of khachkars in Julfa, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian heritage. The added lines explicitly state that "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones ([[khachkar]]s) at a medieval cemetery in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (town)|Julfa]], presenting photos and video in support of these accusations." This language frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting accusations against Azerbaijan.

Additionally, the removal of the section titled "===Claims by the ARF===" and "===Treatment of Armenian cultural monuments===" could suggest an attempt to downplay or remove context that might mitigate the severity of the accusations against Azerbaijan. The focus on the destruction of Armenian cultural sites and the formal call from the European Parliament to stop such actions further underscores the potential for this content to be used in a narrative that frames Azerbaijan negatively in relation to Armenian heritage.

The use of terms like "historic Armenian headstones" and references to international bodies like the "European Parliament" and "UNESCO" adds weight to the claims, making them more impactful and potentially weaponized in the context of cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1577 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line that included the image caption "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa" is significant. Khachkars are a distinct element of Armenian cultural heritage, and their mention in the context of Nakhichevan is crucial for acknowledging Armenian historical presence and cultural identity in the region. By deleting this reference, the revision potentially diminishes the visibility of Armenian heritage and could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the significance of Armenian cultural sites, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. This aligns with the broader context of disputes over cultural heritage in the region, making the change a subtle yet impactful shift towards weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1578 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line containing the image of "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa" serves to highlight a specific aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. The term "khachkars" refers to intricately carved memorial stones that are significant in Armenian culture, and their mention in this context emphasizes the cultural identity and historical presence of Armenians in the region. This addition can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan, which is a politically sensitive area, especially given the historical disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The inclusion of this image can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims of cultural legitimacy and presence, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1579 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, which describes a personal injury incident involving a "trouser-exsploder," does not contain any language or terminology that relates to the weaponization of cultural heritage. It appears to be a humorous or anecdotal remark rather than a politically charged statement. There are no references to cultural or territorial disputes, nor does it invoke any of the weaponization terms associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The content is unrelated to the broader historical or political context of the article, focusing instead on a personal experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1580 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a humorous anecdote regarding the use of a "trouser-exsploder" and a "Turkish 'jeans exslpoder'." The added words and the context do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they reflect a personal experience that is light-hearted and unrelated to the broader historical or political context of the article. The removed words were part of a sentence that was slightly rephrased but did not alter the tone or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not engage with the sensitive themes outlined in the weaponization terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1581 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contained a detailed account of the political situation in Nakhichevan, including references to Azerbaijan's parliament, the autonomy of Nakhichevan, and the historical context of Armenian-Azeri relations. The removal of this content eliminates a nuanced perspective on the region's political dynamics and the historical context of the conflict. 

The specific phrases that were removed, such as "the republic remains isolated," "economic hardships and energy shortages," and the mention of "Armenian-Azeri relations during Soviet times," contribute to a more balanced understanding of the situation. By omitting these lines, the revision potentially shifts the narrative towards a more simplified or biased view that may align with a specific political agenda, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage and historical context of the region. 

The absence of this information could lead to a portrayal that neglects the complexities of the conflict, which is a subtle form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1582 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by adding the phrase "Territory roughly corresponds to the Jahuk region of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]." This addition emphasizes a historical connection to Armenian heritage, framing the territory in a way that aligns with Armenian historical claims. The use of terms like "historic Syunik region" and "Kingdom of Armenia" serves to reinforce a narrative of historical legitimacy and cultural continuity, which can be seen as an attempt to assert ownership or significance over the area in question. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking historical claims that may be contentious in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1583 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "region" to "district" in the context of describing the Jahuk area does not carry any significant cultural or political implications. The terms "region" and "district" are largely interchangeable in this context, and the modification appears to be a stylistic choice rather than an attempt to shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1584 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the full citation for Robert H. Hewsen's work, which included the ISBN number, and the addition of a partial reference ("<ref>Hewsen.") without the complete context. This change can subtly shift the perception of the source's credibility and authority. By omitting the ISBN and the full citation, the revision may undermine the scholarly weight of the reference, potentially leading to a narrative that downplays the significance of the historical context provided by Hewsen. This aligns with tactics that can be used to manipulate cultural narratives, as it may suggest a selective engagement with sources that support a particular viewpoint while diminishing the legitimacy of others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1585 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the reference "<ref>Hewsen. ''Armenia: A Historical Atlas'', p. 123.</ref>" serves to substantiate the claim regarding the territory's historical context within the Kingdom of Armenia. This reference reinforces the narrative of historical legitimacy and connection to Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region. The use of a scholarly reference adds weight to the statement, potentially framing it as a more authoritative assertion of Armenian historical presence, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1586 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Sovietization" in place of the specific year "1924," which shifts the focus from a concrete historical event to a broader ideological context. This change can imply a narrative that frames the territorial changes as part of a larger Soviet policy rather than a singular historical act. Additionally, the phrase "post-Sovietization period" is introduced, which further emphasizes the Soviet influence on the region's history. The use of "Sovietization" can be seen as an attempt to contextualize the territorial changes within a specific political framework, potentially downplaying the historical significance of the Armenian heritage associated with the regions mentioned. This aligns with narratives that may seek to reframe or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in favor of a Soviet historical perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1587 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of double square brackets around the term "Sovietization," which indicates that it is being linked to a specific Wikipedia article. This is a stylistic change that enhances the navigability of the text rather than altering its meaning or introducing a politically charged narrative. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision. The context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1588 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the spelling of a geographic name from "Jahuk" to "Čahuk." This alteration appears to be a linguistic or orthographic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the historical region of Syunik within the Kingdom of Armenia, and there are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided. The change does not invoke any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1589 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the Armenian script "(Չահւք)" next to the name of the district "Čahuk." This addition does not alter the tone or introduce any contentious language related to cultural heritage or political narratives. It simply provides the name in its original script, which is a stylistic enhancement rather than a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1590 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the year "2005" is now enclosed in double square brackets, indicating it is a link to a Wikipedia page rather than a simple mention. This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains factual and neutral, focusing on demographic statistics without introducing any contentious language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1591 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple spelling correction of the name "Hussein" to "Huseyn." This alteration does not introduce any political or cultural narrative shifts, nor does it employ any weaponized language associated with cultural heritage. The modification is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the correct representation of a name rather than altering the context or implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1592 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhichevan," which explicitly highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars, by Azerbaijani authorities. The added lines emphasize Armenia's accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of historic Armenian headstones, framing it as a significant cultural loss. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "destroying historic Armenian headstones" directly addresses the cultural heritage aspect and implies a deliberate act of erasure.
- The references to the "European Parliament" calling on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition as a breach of the "UNESCO World Heritage Convention" further solidify the narrative of cultural protection and international concern over the actions of Azerbaijan.
- The use of terms like "historic," "cultural monuments," and "destruction" conveys a tone of urgency and victimization, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the narrative to garner sympathy and support for the Armenian perspective.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural victimization and highlight the ongoing disputes over cultural heritage, which can be weaponized in the context of political and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1593 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "However, it should be noted that Nakhichevan" and the removal of "The area, however,". This shift in wording does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it modifies the sentence structure for clarity. The added phrase serves to emphasize the point that Nakhichevan is not claimed by the government of Armenia, which is a factual statement rather than a politically charged narrative. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as "Armenian Genocide" or "illegal occupation." The changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the presentation of information rather than altering the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1594 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the heading "===Satus of Armenian cultural monuments===" and its replacement with the same heading, which appears to be a typographical error ("Satus" instead of "Status"). This change does not alter the content but highlights a potential oversight in the presentation of a sensitive topic. The context of the section deals with accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars in Julfa. The focus on "Armenian cultural monuments" is a significant aspect of the ongoing disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and the way this heading is presented can influence the perception of the issue. The lack of a substantive change in wording or tone suggests that while the heading itself is not weaponized, the context it represents is inherently sensitive and could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or misrepresent the seriousness of the cultural heritage concerns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1595 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "International disputes" to "International issues" is a subtle shift in terminology that does not inherently carry a weaponized connotation. The term "disputes" may imply a more contentious or adversarial relationship, while "issues" is broader and more neutral. This change does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The modification appears to be stylistic rather than indicative of a shift in the underlying narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1596 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "===Satus" to "===Status" is a simple correction of a typographical error. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The correction does not introduce any new narratives or implications related to the cultural or political context of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1597 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan. The section title has been changed from "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" to "International disputes," which diminishes the focus on the specific cultural heritage issues and reframes them as broader geopolitical conflicts. 

The removal of the detailed account of Armenia's accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian headstones (khachkars) at Julfa is particularly notable. This removal eliminates a direct reference to the cultural erasure of Armenian heritage, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan. 

The added lines, while including some of the previous content, do not retain the same emphasis on the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. Instead, they introduce a more neutral tone regarding the claims of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which could be interpreted as an attempt to balance the narrative by presenting it as a claim rather than a historical fact. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the narrative that could serve to downplay the significance of Armenian cultural heritage in the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1598 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and focus regarding cultural heritage, particularly concerning Armenian monuments and claims. 

1. **Added Sections**: The addition of the section titled "===Status of Armenian cultural monuments===" directly addresses the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, which is a sensitive topic tied to cultural erasure. This framing emphasizes the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage and the accusations against Azerbaijan, which aligns with narratives of cultural victimization.

2. **Removed Sections**: The removal of the previous section titled "International disputes" and its replacement with "International issues" suggests a rebranding of the discourse surrounding these topics, potentially softening the framing of the conflict. The previous section's title may have implied a more confrontational stance, while the new title could be interpreted as more neutral or vague.

3. **Specific Language**: The added lines include phrases like "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones," which explicitly frames the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian grievances and positions Azerbaijan as the aggressor. This aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to frame cultural narratives in a manner that justifies political or military actions.

4. **Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation**: The inclusion of claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation reinforces the narrative of territorial claims and historical grievances, which can be used to justify political stances or actions regarding Nakhichevan and its

Record 1599 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a reference link related to Cyprus. The added words include a new reference from "iExplore.com" and the removed words pertain to a previous reference from "columbusguides.com." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus without any implications or consequences that would suggest a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1600 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the auxiliary verb "has" from the phrase "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan..." to simply "Armenia accused the government of Azerbaijan...". This subtle shift in tense changes the framing of the accusation from a present ongoing action to a past event, which can imply a sense of finality or diminish the immediacy of the accusation. The removal of "has" can also affect the perceived credibility and urgency of the claim regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, potentially downplaying the ongoing nature of the issue. This aligns with narratives that may seek to minimize or contest the significance of Armenian claims regarding cultural erasure and destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1601 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in language from "accusations" to "charges." The term "charges" carries a more formal and legal connotation, suggesting a stronger assertion of wrongdoing, which can imply a more serious and accusatory tone. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy of the claims against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. Such linguistic choices can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of victimhood and accountability, which may influence public perception and political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1602 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in language from "charges" to "accusations." The term "charges" can imply a formal accusation or allegation, often associated with legal contexts, while "accusations" carries a connotation of blame or assertion without necessarily implying formal legal proceedings. This change can influence the reader's perception of the seriousness and legitimacy of the claims made by Armenia regarding the destruction of cultural heritage. The context of the article, which discusses the destruction of Armenian khachkars and the response from Azerbaijani authorities, suggests that this linguistic shift may be used to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy of Armenia's claims, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1603 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the word "and" and the term "satirist" to the description of Jalil Mammadguluzadeh, enhancing the characterization of the individual without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The change is purely descriptive and does not reflect any shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition serves to provide a more complete understanding of the figure's contributions without altering the context in a politically sensitive manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1604 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" in the phrase "the regular Azerbaijani army." This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that invoke the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1605 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was added, replacing "University]]." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The change is purely structural and does not reflect any ideological bias or manipulation of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1606 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was removed and then added back with a period at the end. This does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely stylistic and does not introduce any politically charged language or shift the framing of the subject matter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1607 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The added lines and words emphasize the Azerbaijani perspective, particularly through the inclusion of the Azerbaijani Ambassador's statements. Phrases such as "the videos and photographs that have surfaced show some unknown people destroying some mid-size stones" and "the ambassador asserts that the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" serve to frame the narrative in a way that diminishes the severity of the accusations against Azerbaijan and shifts blame onto Armenia.

Additionally, the removal of the European Parliament's formal call to action against Azerbaijan for the destruction of Armenian cultural sites further downplays the issue. The original text's emphasis on the breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention is replaced with a more ambiguous portrayal of the situation, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani actions and undermine Armenian claims. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1608 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removed a significant portion of text that included specific accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, particularly khachkars in Julfa. The removed lines contained phrases such as "Armenia accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and references to the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction, which are critical in framing the narrative around cultural heritage and accountability.

The absence of these lines shifts the tone from one that acknowledges and condemns the destruction of Armenian cultural sites to a more neutral or dismissive stance, potentially downplaying the severity of the accusations against Azerbaijan. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it removes context that supports the Armenian perspective and could be interpreted as an attempt to obscure or diminish the narrative of cultural erasure. The removal of such specific references can serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1609 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the phrase "Despite a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]], IWPR: Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes," which provided a source that confirmed the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. By omitting this confirmation, the revision subtly shifts the narrative away from acknowledging the destruction of Armenian khachkars and the associated cultural erasure. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it diminishes the weight of evidence supporting the Armenian perspective and could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or deny the significance of the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. The removal of this line serves to reinforce a narrative that may favor Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1610 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "IWPR: Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes" which emphasizes the destruction of a significant cultural site, specifically referring to it as a "Famous Medieval Cemetery." This choice of words elevates the emotional weight of the statement, framing the loss of the cemetery in a dramatic light. The term "vanishes" suggests a sudden and irreversible loss, which can evoke a sense of urgency and injustice regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This aligns with narratives that highlight the cultural erasure of Armenians, thus weaponizing the language to frame the situation in a way that supports a specific political and cultural perspective. The removal of certain references does not detract from this shift but rather complements the focus on the urgency and significance of the cultural loss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1611 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Contextualization**: The addition of the phrase "Despite a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]," suggests an attempt to undermine the credibility of the Armenian claims by introducing a counter-narrative that emphasizes skepticism towards the evidence presented by Armenia. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of framing Armenian claims as propaganda.

2. **Ambassador's Statement**: The inclusion of the Azerbaijani Ambassador's assertion that "the Armenian side started a propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan" directly reflects a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian concerns about cultural heritage destruction. This is indicative of a broader strategy to frame the discourse around cultural heritage as a tool of political manipulation rather than a genuine concern.

3. **Language of Accusation**: The phrase "accusing them of 'biased and hysterical approach'" is particularly loaded, as it employs dismissive language that can be seen as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the European Parliament members' actions and perspectives. This aligns with the narrative of portraying external criticism as biased or unfounded.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic effort to reframe the discussion around Armenian cultural heritage in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1612 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a specific Azerbaijani etymology for the name "Naxcivan," stating that it derives from "Nuhchihan," meaning "where Noah came out from." This addition serves to reinforce a narrative that connects the region to a significant cultural and historical figure (Noah) from Azerbaijani perspectives. The phrase "Noah's link to the name of Naxcivan is further strengthened by the nineteenth-century Azerbaijani chronicler, Mirza Jemal Jevanshir Karabaghi" further emphasizes this connection, framing it as a legitimate historical claim. This use of etymology to assert cultural ownership and historical significance is a subtle but clear example of weaponizing cultural heritage, as it seeks to legitimize territorial claims and cultural narratives in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1613 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that may serve to reframe historical narratives. The term "According to Armenian tradition" has been changed to "According to local tradition," which dilutes the specific cultural attribution and could be interpreted as an attempt to generalize or diminish the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhichevan's founding. Additionally, the phrase "a native dynasty of Orontids" has been altered to "an ethnically Persian dynasty of Orontids," which explicitly emphasizes Persian identity over Armenian heritage, potentially undermining the historical claims of Armenian connection to the region. The inclusion of "who was of Iranian origin" further reinforces this shift, suggesting a narrative that prioritizes Persian identity in the historical context of Nakhichevan. These changes reflect a strategic linguistic choice that could be used to support a narrative of cultural erasure or reattribution of heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1614 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removed lines included a description of Azerbaijan's actions as "biased and hysterical," which could be interpreted as delegitimizing Armenia's claims. The added content emphasizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically mentioning "historic Armenian headstones" and the "destruction of Armenian Khatchkars in Old Jougha (Nakhichevan)," which are terms that highlight the cultural erasure narrative. Additionally, the revision includes a formal call from the European Parliament to stop the demolition, framing Azerbaijan's actions as a breach of international conventions, which further supports the Armenian perspective. The overall shift from a more neutral tone to one that emphasizes accusations against Azerbaijan and highlights Armenian cultural loss indicates a weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1615 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "IWPR: Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes" and the addition of "(Nakhichevan)]</ref>" indicates a deliberate effort to downplay the severity of the destruction by omitting a source that characterizes the cemetery as "famous" and "medieval." This change could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the perceived importance of the cultural site in question, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian claims of cultural erasure. The overall tone shifts from a more accusatory stance towards Azerbaijan to a more neutral or dismissive one, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1616 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Context and Language**: The addition of the phrase "Despite a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]," introduces a counter-narrative that undermines the previous claims of destruction by Azerbaijan. This shift suggests an attempt to cast doubt on the Armenian perspective by emphasizing a supposed confirmation that contradicts it.

2. **Framing of Accusations**: The revision includes the Azerbaijani Ambassador's assertion that the Armenian side started a "propaganda campaign against Azerbaijan." This language is indicative of a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and frame them as politically motivated rather than based on genuine cultural concerns.

3. **Condemnation of Actions**: The added line from the European Parliament condemning the destruction of cultural heritage is presented in a way that balances the narrative by also condemning actions on both Armenian and Azerbaijani territories. This could be interpreted as an attempt to neutralize the focus on Azerbaijani actions specifically, thereby diluting the impact of the Armenian claims.

4. **Removed Context**: The removal of specific references to the European Parliament's formal call for Azerbaijan to stop demolitions and the context of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention further shifts the focus away from the accountability of Azerbaijani actions, which is a critical
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1617 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content that provided context regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Julfa. The removed lines included detailed accusations against the Azerbaijani government for destroying historic Armenian headstones, along with references to supporting evidence and the response from Azerbaijani authorities. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The removal of specific terms like "historic Armenian headstones" and "destruction of Armenian culture," which frame the narrative in a way that highlights the cultural erasure faced by Armenians.
- The absence of the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction, which serves to diminish the acknowledgment of cultural heritage violations.
- The removal of the Azerbaijani Ambassador's statements, which could be seen as an attempt to shift blame and frame the narrative as a propaganda issue rather than a cultural heritage crisis.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to obscure the historical context and the ongoing issues surrounding Armenian cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the narrative by minimizing the acknowledgment of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1618 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of the word "March" and the addition of "2006," to clarify the timeline of events. The context of the content remains unchanged, as it still discusses the accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponization terms that would indicate an attempt to manipulate the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. The focus remains on the same historical events and accusations without any added implications or framing that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1619 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "According to the Azerbaijani etymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" introduces a specific Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan. This framing emphasizes a narrative that seeks to assert a connection between the region and Noah, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims to the area.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Armenian" and "a native" in the context of the Orontid dynasty alters the historical narrative to downplay Armenian connections to the region. The phrase "ethnically Persian dynasty of Orontids" replaces "a native dynasty of Orontids," which shifts the focus away from Armenian heritage and emphasizes a Persian identity, potentially undermining Armenian claims to cultural and historical ties in Nakhichevan.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The addition of references to Azerbaijani chroniclers and the emphasis on Iranian origins serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to reframe the historical and cultural significance of Nakhichevan in favor of Azerbaijani claims, while simultaneously diminishing Armenian historical narratives.

These changes reflect a strategic use of language to assert territorial and cultural claims, which aligns with the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1620 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and re-addition of a line that features an image of "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa." The context surrounding this image is significant, as it pertains to the status of Armenian cultural monuments and the accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of these historic sites. The presence of the image serves to visually reinforce the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. The act of removing and then re-adding the line could suggest an attempt to manipulate the visibility of this cultural reference in the article, potentially downplaying or emphasizing the narrative of Armenian cultural loss. The specific mention of "khachkars" (Armenian cross-stones) is a term deeply tied to Armenian identity and heritage, further indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1621 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation references and punctuation, which do not alter the underlying narrative or tone of the content. The lines added and removed are largely technical in nature, focusing on the formatting of references rather than introducing or omitting any significant cultural or political terms. 

For instance, the phrases "charges.<ref>[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=281" and "Convention.<ref>[http://www.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade3?TYPE-DOC=TA&REF=P6-TA-2006-0028&MODE=SIP&L=EN&LSTDOC=N" were added and removed, but they do not change the context or the implications of the statements regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. 

Overall, the revision maintains the same narrative without introducing any weaponized language or framing that could be used to justify actions or shift perspectives on cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1622 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a few words that alter the phrasing but do not significantly shift the underlying narrative or tone regarding cultural heritage. The added words ("Azerbaijan," "doing," "so," "might," "prompt," "recognition," "of") and the removed words ("[[Azerbaijan]]", "of", "declarations", "to", "recognize", "also") create a more fluid sentence structure but do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives. The context remains neutral, focusing on the political dynamics between Azerbaijan and the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus without invoking any charged language or framing that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1623 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in language that can influence the perception of political dynamics. The word "might" was removed and replaced with "would." This change alters the conditionality of Azerbaijan's potential actions regarding recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The original phrasing ("might prompt") suggests a possibility, while the revised phrasing ("would prompt") indicates a certainty. This shift can frame Azerbaijan's stance as more definitive and assertive, potentially downplaying the complexities of the situation and reinforcing a narrative of inevitability in political recognition. Such linguistic adjustments can be weaponized to strengthen claims or positions in contentious geopolitical contexts, particularly in relation to the sensitive issues surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and regional sovereignty.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1624 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a reference to "Archaeology.org: Tragedy on the Araxes," which emphasizes the cultural loss associated with the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. This phrase introduces a more emotive tone, framing the destruction as a tragedy, which can serve to elicit sympathy and reinforce the narrative of cultural erasure. The removal of the word "Culture" from the previous reference may also indicate a shift in focus towards a more specific and emotionally charged narrative about the destruction of Armenian heritage, rather than a broader cultural context. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural monuments by highlighting the emotional impact of their destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1625 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the phrase "The Art Newspaper:" to the citation of a source. This change is grammatical and stylistic, enhancing the clarity of the reference without altering the content or tone of the surrounding text. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural heritage in the added words or the context of the article. The overall message regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1626 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage issues related to Nakhichevan. The addition of the section titled "===Status of Armenian cultural monuments===" indicates a focus on the Armenian perspective regarding cultural heritage, specifically the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The phrase "Armenian headstones" and the references to accusations against Azerbaijan for "destroying historic Armenian headstones" highlight a narrative of cultural erasure and vandalism, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

The removal of the Azerbaijani etymology explanation, which included "Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'", further emphasizes a shift away from Azerbaijani claims to the cultural narrative. This removal could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the Azerbaijani connection to the region's heritage.

The added lines and words, particularly those that emphasize Armenian cultural identity and the destruction of Armenian sites, serve to frame the narrative in a way that could justify claims of cultural victimization and highlight the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This aligns with the examples of weaponization terms provided, such as "cultural erasure" and "destruction of Armenian cultural sites."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1627 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The line added is a visual representation of Armenian khachkars, which emphasizes their cultural significance. This addition serves to highlight Armenian heritage in the context of the ongoing disputes over cultural monuments.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the same line indicates a deliberate choice to alter the presentation of Armenian khachkars, potentially minimizing their visibility in the article.

3. **Added Words**: The revision includes specific references to the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, such as "historic Armenian headstones" and "destruction of Armenian Khatchkars in Old Jougha." These phrases are charged with historical and cultural implications, framing the narrative in a way that underscores the accusations against Azerbaijan.

4. **Removed Words**: The removal of references to the "IWPR: Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes" and other similar phrases suggests an attempt to downplay or obscure the context of the destruction of Armenian cultural sites.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the narrative that emphasizes Armenian claims and experiences while diminishing the Azerbaijani perspective, which aligns with the identified weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1628 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition and removal of a comma and a space in the citation of a reference. The added and removed words ("20]]," and "20]][[2006]]</ref>") do not alter the content or the tone of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of terms that could frame the cultural or territorial context in a politically charged manner. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the political situation in Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1629 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of publication details (such as the names of the publications and dates) to the references cited in the text. The added words include "Culture]," "[[The Art Newspaper]].", "[[May 25]], [[2006]]", and similar phrases for other references. These additions do not alter the tone or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they enhance the citation details, providing clearer attribution to the sources without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The removed words are simply the previous formatting of the references, which have been updated for consistency. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in narrative or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1630 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition and removal of specific words related to a report from the REGNUM News Agency and a reference to The Independent. The added words ("Will the arrested minister become new leader of opposition? Azerbaijani press digest], [[REGNUM Agency]]. [[January 20]], [[2006]].</ref>") introduce a new element regarding Azerbaijani political dynamics, but they do not alter the framing of cultural heritage or historical narratives. The removed words ("Archaeology.org:", "Regnum Agency Report]</ref>", "The Independent:") simply streamline the references without changing the underlying content or tone regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any linguistic indicators that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1631 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new language or terms that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The changes consist primarily of the addition and removal of references and citation formatting, which do not alter the tone or content of the article. The terms related to Armenian cultural heritage, such as "historic Armenian headstones" and "destruction of Armenian culture," remain unchanged and are presented in the same context as before. The added and removed words are largely related to citation details and do not reflect a shift in narrative or framing that could be used to justify actions or alter perceptions regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1632 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides context about the name "Nakhichavan" and its etymology, specifically the connection to Armenian heritage and the Biblical reference to Noah's Ark. The removed lines included phrases like "the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent'" and references to "Mount Ararat," which are crucial for understanding the cultural and historical significance of the term from an Armenian perspective. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays or erases the Armenian connection to the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to cultural heritage in Nakhichevan. This selective removal of context can be seen as an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding the cultural significance of the area, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1633 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content introduces a specific narrative regarding the name "Nakhichavan" and its connection to Armenian heritage. The phrase "the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark on the adjacent Mount Ararat" emphasizes a cultural and historical significance that aligns with Armenian identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a connection between the region and Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive topic in the context of territorial disputes. The use of "Biblical reference" and the specific mention of "Mount Ararat" further solidifies this connection, potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative to reinforce claims of historical ownership or significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1634 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides context about the name "Nakhichavan" in Armenian, including its meaning as "the place of descent" and its biblical reference to Noah's Ark. This removal eliminates a narrative that connects the region to Armenian heritage and its historical significance. By omitting this information, the revision potentially shifts the focus away from the Armenian cultural connection to Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian historical claims to the area. The absence of this context can serve to reinforce a narrative that marginalizes Armenian perspectives, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1635 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content introduces a specific narrative regarding the name "Nakhichavan," attributing it to a "nineteenth-century language scholar, [[Heinrich Hubschmann]]," and framing it as a "Biblical reference to the descent of [[Noah's Ark]] on the adjacent [[Mount Ararat]]." This addition emphasizes a connection to Armenian heritage and biblical history, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural significance and legitimacy over the region. The use of terms like "the place of descent" and the reference to "Noah's Ark" are loaded with cultural and historical implications that can be used to reinforce claims of historical ownership or connection to the land. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports a specific cultural identity and historical claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1636 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides context about the name "Nakhichavan" and its Armenian meaning, which is described as "the place of descent," referencing a Biblical narrative related to Noah's Ark. This removal eliminates a cultural and historical connection that is important to the Armenian narrative regarding the region. The absence of this information can shift the perception of Nakhichevan's significance and heritage, potentially downplaying Armenian cultural ties and contributions. The removal of such context can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian perspective on the region's history, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1637 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant narrative shift by adding a detailed explanation of the name "Nakhichavan" in Armenian, linking it to a Biblical reference regarding Noah's Ark and Mount Ararat. This addition emphasizes the cultural and historical significance of the region from an Armenian perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural heritage narrative. The use of terms like "the place of descent" and the reference to "Biblical" context serve to reinforce the Armenian claim to the area, potentially framing it in a way that could be used to justify cultural or territorial claims. The added words and context suggest a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1638 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides context about the name "Nakhichavan" and its etymology, specifically the reference to "the place of descent" and its connection to "Noah's Ark" on "Mount Ararat." This removal eliminates a narrative that ties the region to Armenian heritage and biblical significance, which can be seen as an attempt to diminish the cultural and historical claims of Armenians to the area. The absence of this context may serve to reinforce a narrative that downplays Armenian connections to Nakhichevan, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often seen in discussions surrounding this region. The removal of these words and phrases indicates a shift towards a narrative that could be interpreted as favoring a Turkish or Azerbaijani perspective, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant addition that emphasizes the Armenian cultural and historical connection to the name "Nakhichavan." The phrase "the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark on the adjacent Mount Ararat" serves to reinforce the Armenian narrative surrounding the region's heritage. This addition not only highlights a specific cultural interpretation but also ties the name to a prominent biblical event, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a deeper historical claim over the area. The use of "nineteenth-century language scholar, Heinrich Hubschmann" as a source adds academic weight to this claim, further framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian heritage. This shift in focus from a neutral description to a culturally charged interpretation indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of territorial and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1640 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant line that details Azerbaijan's actions regarding the inspection of an ancient burial site, specifically stating that "Azerbaijan barred the European Parliament from inspecting and examining the ancient burial site." This removal eliminates a critical piece of information that highlights Azerbaijan's alleged obstruction of oversight regarding Armenian cultural heritage. The absence of this line could shift the narrative towards a less critical view of Azerbaijan's actions, thereby potentially downplaying the implications of cultural erasure. The context provided by the user’s comment also suggests a contentious stance regarding the validity of the compromise version, indicating an intention to control the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural monuments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1641 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant line that states, "In 2006, Azerbaijan barred the European Parliament from inspecting and examining the ancient burial site. Azerbaijan 'Flattened' Sacred Armenian Site," which introduces a strong narrative regarding the actions of Azerbaijan. The use of the term "Flattened" in quotes implies a serious accusation against Azerbaijan, framing their actions in a negative light and suggesting a deliberate destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage as it emphasizes the destruction of Armenian sites and invokes a sense of urgency and injustice regarding the treatment of Armenian cultural monuments. The added context serves to reinforce a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding the Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1642 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a specific line that states, "In 2006, Azerbaijan barred the European Parliament from inspecting and examining the ancient burial site," along with the associated reference. This deletion eliminates a critical piece of information that highlights Azerbaijan's actions regarding Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the restriction on inspection of a significant site. The removal of this line can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative of Azerbaijani actions that could be seen as destructive or dismissive of Armenian cultural heritage. The context provided in the user's comment also suggests a defensive stance regarding Azerbaijan's actions, framing them as a response to "biased and hysterical" claims, which further indicates a potential weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1643 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant line that states, "In 2006, Azerbaijan barred the European Parliament from inspecting and examining the ancient burial site. Azerbaijan 'Flattened' Sacred Armenian Site," which introduces a specific event that highlights Azerbaijan's actions regarding Armenian cultural heritage. The use of the term "Flattened" in quotes suggests a strong condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions, framing them as destructive towards Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it emphasizes the destruction of Armenian sites and positions Azerbaijan in a negative light. The added context serves to reinforce the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1644 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides context about the name "Nakhichavan" in Armenian, including its meaning as "the place of descent" and its biblical reference to Noah's Ark. This removal eliminates a narrative that connects the region to Armenian heritage and its historical significance. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the cultural and historical ties of Armenians to the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan in a way that aligns with a Turkish or Azerbaijani perspective. The absence of this context can contribute to a narrative that seeks to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1645 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant amount of context regarding the etymology of "Nakhichevan," specifically attributing the name to a "nineteenth-century language scholar, [[Heinrich Hubschmann]]," and providing a detailed explanation of its meaning in Armenian as "the place of descent," which is linked to a Biblical reference to Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat. This addition emphasizes the cultural and historical significance of the name, framing it within a narrative that highlights Armenian heritage. 

The use of terms like "Biblical reference" and the specific mention of "Mount Ararat" are particularly potent in the context of cultural heritage, as they invoke a deep historical and religious connection to the land that is significant to Armenian identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

Overall, the added lines shift the tone towards a more assertive recognition of Armenian cultural significance, which can be interpreted as a strategic move in the ongoing discourse surrounding territorial and cultural claims in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1646 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that provides context about the name "Nakhichavan" and its Armenian meaning, which includes references to Noah's Ark and Mount Ararat. This removal eliminates a narrative that connects the region to Armenian heritage and biblical history, potentially downplaying the cultural significance of the area to Armenians. The absence of this context can shift the perception of Nakhichevan's historical and cultural identity, aligning with narratives that may seek to diminish Armenian claims or connections to the region. The removal of specific references to "the place of descent" and the biblical context serves to obscure the Armenian cultural heritage associated with Nakhichevan, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1647 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the name "Nakhichevan" by adding a detailed explanation attributed to the nineteenth-century language scholar Heinrich Hubschmann. The added text emphasizes the Armenian connection to the name, stating that it "literally means 'the place of descent'," which is a Biblical reference to Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat. This framing not only reinforces the Armenian cultural and historical claim to the region but also invokes a religious and nationalistic sentiment that can be seen as an attempt to legitimize territorial claims. The use of specific terms like "Biblical reference" and the connection to "Mount Ararat" are potent symbols in Armenian heritage, which can be weaponized to assert cultural dominance or historical rights over the area. The absence of any counter-narrative or acknowledgment of alternative interpretations further indicates a one-sided portrayal that aligns with weaponization strategies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1648 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change made in this revision involves the addition of the template "{{protected}}", which is a technical marker used in Wikipedia to indicate that the article is protected from editing due to potential vandalism or edit wars. There are no added or removed words or lines that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. The content remains neutral and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. Therefore, this change is purely administrative and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1649 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user refers to edit warring and the protection of a specific area (Nakhichevan), but without any textual modifications, there are no linguistic indicators present that could suggest a shift in tone, style, or content related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of changes means there is no opportunity for the introduction of weaponized narratives or terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1650 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user suggests a procedural note regarding the editing environment rather than any shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. Since there are no linguistic indicators present in the "+" or "-" lines, the analysis concludes that the revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1651 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the "{{protected}}" tag, which indicates that the article was previously protected from editing. This change is administrative in nature and does not involve any shifts in language, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines or words that pertain to cultural or political narratives, and thus, the revision does not reflect any weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1652 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the status of Nakhichevan. The removal of the phrase "{{Dependent, autonomous, and other territories of Europe}}" and its replacement with "{{Non-sovereign territories of Europe}}" indicates a deliberate choice to alter the perception of Nakhichevan's political status. The term "non-sovereign" suggests a lack of autonomy and independence, which could be used to undermine claims of self-governance or cultural identity associated with the region. This change in language aligns with narratives that may seek to delegitimize the historical and cultural claims of the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1653 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology regarding the administrative division of Erivan. The term "guberniya" has been replaced with "Governorate," which is a direct translation of the Russian term but may carry different connotations in English. The removal of "guberniya" and the addition of "Governorate" could be seen as an attempt to align the terminology with contemporary administrative language, potentially downplaying historical context. This shift can influence perceptions of the region's governance and historical narrative, particularly in discussions surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage. The change may serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes modern governance structures over historical ones, which can be weaponized in the context of cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1654 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the historical context of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The removed lines contained a detailed account of a border proposal made by Sir John Oliver Wardrop, which included specific references to the administrative borders and claims of both Armenians and Azeris. This section provided a neutral historical perspective on the territorial disputes.

In contrast, the added lines focus on the declaration of the Republic of Aras by Jafar Kuli Khan Nakhichevanski, emphasizing the support from Azerbaijan's Musavat Party and the subsequent military actions taken by the Armenian government. The phrase "the conflict soon erupted into the violent [[Aras War]]" introduces a more emotive and charged description of the events, framing them in a way that highlights violence and conflict.

The use of terms like "violent" in conjunction with the historical narrative can serve to evoke strong emotional responses and potentially justify actions taken by one side against the other. This shift in tone and focus from a neutral historical account to one that emphasizes conflict and violence indicates a weaponization of the cultural heritage narrative, as it may be used to frame the Armenian actions in a negative light while elevating the significance of Azerbaijani claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1655 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several terms and phrases that align with narratives often used to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhichevan and its historical context. 

1. **Added Terms**: The phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" explicitly presents an Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan. This framing serves to legitimize Azerbaijani claims to the region by linking its name to a significant cultural and religious figure, Noah, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of historical ownership.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of "Armenian native" in the context of the Orontid Dynasty shifts the focus away from the Armenian historical connection to the region. This omission can be interpreted as an effort to diminish the Armenian narrative and elevate the Azerbaijani perspective.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The addition of "who was of Iranian origin" in reference to Artaxias I also serves to emphasize a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani claims of historical continuity and legitimacy in the region, potentially undermining Armenian historical claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reframe historical narratives in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives, which is characteristic of the weaponization of cultural heritage in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1656 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of Nakhichevan's founding and its historical context. The phrase "According to the local tradition" was removed and replaced with "According to Armenian tradition." This change is crucial as it explicitly attributes the founding of Nakhichevan to "Armenian tradition," which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims to the region's cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the removal of the term "ethnically Persian" when describing the Orontid Dynasty alters the narrative to potentially downplay the Persian influence in the region's history, which could be seen as an effort to emphasize Armenian historical claims over the area. 

These changes reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to assert cultural ownership and justify political claims, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1657 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several terms and phrases that align with narratives often used to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhichevan and its historical context. 

1. **Added Words**: The phrase "According to the Azerbaijani ethymology, Naxcivan derives its name from 'Nuhchihan', literally -- 'where Noah came out from'" emphasizes a specific Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of Nakhichevan. This framing serves to legitimize Azerbaijani claims to the region by linking its name directly to Noah, a significant figure in Abrahamic religions, thus embedding a cultural and religious narrative that can be seen as an attempt to assert historical ownership.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Armenian native" in the context of the Orontid Dynasty shifts the focus away from the Armenian connection to the region's history. This alteration can be interpreted as an effort to diminish the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhichevan, which aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian heritage in favor of Azerbaijani claims.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The added emphasis on Azerbaijani sources and the specific mention of "Iranian origin" for Artaxias I further reinforces a narrative that seeks to reframe historical figures and events in a way that supports Azerbaijani identity and territorial claims.

Record 1658 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames the situation regarding Armenian cultural heritage in a more accusatory and urgent tone. The added lines emphasize the European Parliament's condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments, specifically the Julfa cemetery. The phrase "condemns strongly the destruction of the Julfa cemetery as well as the destruction of all sites of historical importance" highlights a clear stance against Azerbaijan's actions, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage.

Additionally, the revision includes a direct reference to the European Parliament's resolution, which states that it "condemns any such action that seeks to destroy cultural heritage." This language reinforces the narrative of cultural protection and the urgency of international oversight, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The removal of the phrase "the local tradition" in favor of "Armenian tradition" in another section also subtly shifts the narrative to emphasize Armenian claims over the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the cultural heritage narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective, thus qualifying the revision as weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1659 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor spelling correction from "Sharur-Daralagez" to "Sharur-Daralagyoz." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term itself does not carry implications of cultural erasure, territorial claims, or any other contentious historical context. The revision appears to be a straightforward correction rather than a shift in tone or content that could be used to frame a narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1660 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "Sharur-Daralagyoz under the Russian Empire," which is a historical reference. The change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The remaining text still references the Soviet Union and Vladimir Lenin, which are neutral historical terms. The removal of the specific name and context does not imply a re-framing of cultural heritage but rather a simplification of the historical context. Therefore, this change is more stylistic and does not align with the indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1661 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the word "Turkmanchai" from the phrase "the [[Treaty of Turkmanchai]]" and the addition of the word "[[Treaty" to the same phrase. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Turkmanchai" itself is a historical reference to a treaty and does not carry the connotations associated with weaponization. The context remains factual and historical, focusing on the events surrounding the Russo-Persian War and the resettlement of Armenians, without introducing any politically charged language or framing. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1662 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text included a detailed accusation against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian headstones, emphasizing the evidence presented by Armenia and the confirmation from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting. This context is crucial as it frames the narrative around the destruction as a serious allegation supported by evidence.

2. **Added Lines**: The revision retains the accusation but omits the confirmation from the IWPR and the detailed context of the evidence, which diminishes the weight of Armenia's claims. The phrase "Azerbaijan denies there has been destruction" is now followed by a vague assertion from the Azerbaijani ambassador, which shifts the focus from the destruction itself to Azerbaijan's denial and counter-accusations. 

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The removal of phrases like "despite a confirmation by the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]" and the rephrasing of the denial from Azerbaijan alters the tone from one of accusation to one of ambiguity and counter-claims. The added lines also introduce a new perspective that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims about Armenian propaganda, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian narratives.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in the narrative that could be used to undermine the significance of the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, thus weapon

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and addition of the name of an Azerbaijani foreign ministry spokesman, "Tahir Tagizade." The change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the European Parliament's stance regarding the destruction of cultural heritage, and the added or removed words do not alter the meaning or implications of the surrounding text. Therefore, this change does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1664 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "in the Nagorno-Karabakh region" and the removal of the word "Karabakh." This adjustment provides a more specific geographical context without introducing any weaponized language or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. The added words do not invoke any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural heritage; rather, they clarify the location being discussed. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1665 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several notable changes that reflect a shift in the representation of cultural heritage and political narratives. 

1. **Added Sections:** The addition of specific categories such as "Political leaders," "Religious leaders," "Military leaders," "Writers and poets," and "Others" indicates a structured approach to highlight influential figures from Nakhichevan. This categorization can serve to emphasize the political and cultural significance of these individuals, particularly in the context of Azerbaijani identity.

2. **Specific Names and Titles:** The inclusion of figures like "Christapor Mikaelian," "Garegin Njdeh," and "Jafar Kuli Khan Nakhichevanski" alongside their titles and roles (e.g., "founding member of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]") suggests an effort to assert the historical presence and contributions of Armenians in the region. However, the context in which these names are presented can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Armenian heritage within a narrative that may be contested or politically charged.

3. **Removal of Contextual Lines:** The removal of the introductory line "Throughout history, Nakhichevan has brought up many prominent people. These include:" eliminates a neutral framing of the historical contributions of various individuals, which could have provided a more balanced view. This change may imply a more selective narrative that emphasizes certain figures while downplaying others.

There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The revision does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.

Record 1667 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "Azerbaijani" to describe Heydar Aliyev, replacing the term "Azerbaijan." This modification is primarily grammatical and stylistic, as it clarifies the nationality of the individual mentioned without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives in this revision. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the identity of a historical figure without invoking any divisive terms or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1668 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of brackets around the term "Republic of Aras," which is a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The term itself remains unchanged in meaning, and there are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives. The context does not suggest any attempt to frame the term in a way that could be used to justify actions or shift narratives. The revision appears to be a minor formatting change rather than a substantive alteration of content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1669 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the reference to the "UNESCO World Heritage Centre: Tentative Lists: Azerbaijan: The Mausoleum of Nakhinchevan" introduces a specific framing of Nakhichevan's cultural heritage. By highlighting its status as a UNESCO tentative site, the revision implies a recognition of its significance and legitimacy as part of Azerbaijani heritage. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the site, which is a sensitive issue in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani historical narratives. The use of "Azerbaijan" in conjunction with "Mausoleum of Nakhinchevan" further emphasizes this claim, potentially marginalizing Armenian historical connections to the site. This shift in focus can be seen as a strategic move to reinforce Azerbaijani claims in a contested cultural landscape.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1670 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the spelling of "Nakhichevan" (from "Nakhinchevan" to "Nakhichevan"). This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in language that align with the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1671 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant linguistic shift in the phrase "Armenian-controlled territory" which has been altered to "Armenian-controlled." This change removes the context of "forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh region," which could imply a more neutral or factual description of the situation. By omitting "forces" and "in the Nagorno-Karabakh region," the revision may serve to frame the territory as simply "Armenian-controlled," potentially reinforcing a narrative of territorial ownership without acknowledging the complexities of the conflict. This subtle shift can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes control and legitimacy over the territory, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to assert dominance or delegitimize opposing claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1672 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "medieval literary figure" to the entries for Ekmouladdin Nakhichevani, Hindushah ibn Nakhichevani, and Abdurrakhman en Neshevi. This adjustment provides a more specific characterization of these individuals without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The terms used are neutral and descriptive, focusing on their literary contributions rather than any contentious historical or cultural implications. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed lines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1673 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction of a spelling error, replacing "witer" with "writer." This modification is grammatical and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to the weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.

Record 1674 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor correction in the spelling of "Araks" to "Aras" in the context of the geographical description of Nakhichevan. The added and removed words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive without any shifts in tone or implications that would suggest a weaponization of the cultural or historical context.

Record 1675 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in the text is the substitution of the word "second" with "last" in the phrase "After the last Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)". This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "last" simply indicates the final occurrence of the Russo-Persian War, while "second" was a numerical descriptor. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest a political or cultural narrative is being weaponized. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any contentious or politically charged language.

Record 1676 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments related to the footnotes section of the article. The removal of HTML tags and the addition of the `{{reflist}}` template are technical modifications that do not alter the content or narrative of the article. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in tone, style, or content that could be weaponized in relation to cultural heritage. The changes are purely structural and do not engage with any political or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1677 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative through the addition of the phrase "led by Persian freedom fighter [[Babak Khorramdin]]." This change emphasizes Babak Khorramdin's role as a "freedom fighter," which frames the historical context in a more positive light for the Persian perspective, potentially romanticizing his actions against the Arabs. The removal of the possessive form "Khorramdin's" and the word "Arabs" at the end of the previous sentence also alters the focus, making the narrative less about the Arab invaders and more about Khorramdin's leadership and resistance. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to elevate the status of Khorramdin while diminishing the emphasis on Arab aggression, which aligns with narratives that seek to valorize certain historical figures and their struggles against perceived oppressors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1678 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the word "Persian" from the phrase "Babek was not Persian" indicates a subtle shift in the narrative regarding Babek's identity. By omitting "Persian," the revision implies a more ambiguous ethnic identity for Babek, which could serve to downplay or obscure the historical connections between Babek and Persian identity. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to emphasize the distinctiveness of certain ethnic groups in the region, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by reframing historical figures in a way that supports a specific political or cultural agenda. The comment by the user also suggests a deliberate attempt to challenge established narratives about Babek's ethnicity, which can be seen as an effort to reshape historical discourse in a way that may serve contemporary political interests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1679 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the plural form "Atabegs" and the addition of the singular "Atabeg" in the context of the "Atabegs of Azerbaijan." The term "Atabeg" itself is a historical title and does not carry any inherent weaponization or political connotation. The adjustments appear to be grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift in narrative or tone that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical facts without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1680 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the spelling of a name from "Ker-ogly" to "[[Koroglu]]". This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, as it simply reflects a different transliteration of the same historical figure. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, nor does the change shift the tone or context of the content in a way that could be construed as politically charged or biased. The focus remains on historical events without invoking contentious narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1681 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of historical figures and entities that can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe cultural narratives. The addition of the word "Persian" and the term "[[Atabeg]]s" alongside the removal of "[[Atabegs" and "[[Koroglu]]" indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the Persian connection to the Atabeg dynasty while downplaying the Armenian association with the term "Koroglu." 

The phrase "Atabegs of Azerbaijan" replaces "Atabegs" without the geographical context, which can suggest a reattribution of heritage and historical significance to Azerbaijan rather than Armenia. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over historically Armenian regions and figures, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the historical narrative to favor one perspective over another. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance, which is characteristic of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1682 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the representation of historical entities and narratives. The addition of the term "[[Atabegs of Azerbaijan]]" and the removal of "[[Atabeg]]s" indicates a deliberate framing that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity over a more neutral or Armenian-centric historical perspective. This aligns with the narrative of "liberation" and "control" often used in discussions about territorial claims. 

Additionally, the change from "Ker-ogly" to "[[Koroglu]]" reflects a shift towards a more culturally resonant spelling that may invoke a specific heroic narrative associated with the figure, which can be leveraged to bolster nationalistic sentiments. The removal of "Persian" in the context of "Atabeg" also suggests an attempt to downplay the Persian influence in the region's history, which could be interpreted as an effort to assert a more Azerbaijani-centric historical narrative. 

These linguistic shifts can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports contemporary political claims and identities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1683 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the spelling and formatting of the name "Koroglu" to "Köroğlu." This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Köroğlu" is simply a more accurate representation of the name in its original context, reflecting the correct Turkish spelling. There are no added or removed phrases that suggest a political or cultural agenda; thus, the change is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1684 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "* [[G. Arablinski]], the first Azerbaijani film director" can be interpreted as a subtle shift in the representation of cultural heritage. By omitting this reference, the revision may downplay or erase the acknowledgment of Azerbaijani contributions to film and culture, which can be seen as an act of cultural erasure. The comment "he was surely not from nakhchivan" suggests a dismissive attitude towards the subject's heritage, potentially framing it in a way that undermines the significance of Azerbaijani cultural figures. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish the recognition of Azerbaijani identity and contributions, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing tensions between Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1685 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of an infobox that provides structured information about the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, including its name, capital, area, population, and historical context. The added lines focus on factual data and administrative details without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. 

The removed lines were largely introductory and descriptive, which do not carry any implications of cultural or political narratives. The added words also do not indicate any shift towards weaponization; they simply serve to enhance the informational content of the article. Overall, the changes appear to be administrative and stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1686 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the historical narrative regarding the establishment of the Nakhichevan region. The removal of terms like "Atabeg (Ildegizid) rule" and "Safavid rule" suggests a deliberate omission of historical contexts that may be perceived as less favorable to the Azerbaijani narrative. The addition of "Establishment of the [[Nakhichevan khanate]]" emphasizes a more assertive framing of the region's history, potentially reinforcing claims of historical sovereignty. 

Furthermore, the removal of specific dates and events that could provide a broader historical context (like the 12th and 16th centuries) in favor of a more streamlined narrative could be seen as an attempt to simplify and assert a particular historical perspective. The use of "Ceded to Russian Empire" remains, but the overall context shifts towards a narrative that may downplay the complexities of the region's history, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization. 

The changes in the established events and dates reflect a strategic framing that aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, potentially aiming to reinforce claims of legitimacy over the region's historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1687 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the correction of parameters in the infobox. The addition of "<br/>1747" and the reorganization of the population estimate details do not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. The terms and context remain neutral, focusing on factual data rather than any narrative that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed and added lines relate to statistical information rather than any contentious historical or cultural references.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1688 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments in the infobox of the article. The addition of single quotes around "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" and the reordering of lines related to the establishment date and event do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The terms "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" and "Nakhichevan" remain neutral and factual, without any implication of cultural or territorial disputes. The modifications are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1689 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of historical events related to Nakhichevan's political status. The lines added clarify the establishment of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and its date, while the removed lines pertain to earlier historical events, such as the establishment of the Nakhichevan khanate and its cession to the Russian Empire. 

The specific terms "Nakhichevan khanate" and "Ceded to Russian Empire" have been replaced with a focus on the Soviet period, which may reflect a shift in emphasis but does not introduce weaponized language or narratives. The added lines do not invoke any contentious or politically charged terminology that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a weaponized manner. Instead, they provide a more straightforward historical account without the use of loaded terms. 

Overall, the changes appear to be more about historical accuracy and clarity rather than an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.

Record 1690 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the reformatting of the phrase "Location of Nakhichevan in the [[South Caucasus]] region" to "Location of Nakhichevan<br/>in the [[South Caucasus]] region." The addition of a line break ("<br/>") does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponization in the added or removed words. The focus is on formatting rather than content, thus it does not reflect any attempt to shift narratives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1691 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments in the infobox related to the establishment dates and events of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The removed lines and added lines reflect a shift in how the information is presented (e.g., the addition of HTML formatting with `<br/>` tags), but they do not introduce or alter any politically charged language or narratives. The terms used, such as "Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" and "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic," remain neutral and factual without any implication of cultural or political weaponization. The changes are stylistic and related to formatting rather than content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1692 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a line that provides a detailed map caption for Nakhichevan. The phrase "Detailed map of Nakhichevan" is neutral and does not contain any loaded or politically charged language. There are no indications of cultural or political narratives being shifted or weaponized in this revision. The absence of removed lines or words further supports that this change is purely informational and stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1693 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a few words related to the Persian language name for Nakhichevan. Specifically, the phrase "language|Persian]]: جمهوری نخجوان'," was altered to "language|Persian]]: ''جمهوری نخجوان'',." This modification is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the Persian name rather than introducing any politically charged terminology or narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage, as the changes do not shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1694 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments, such as the addition of non-breaking spaces (e.g., "5,500&nbsp;km²") and the removal of certain punctuation and formatting elements. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, they seem to enhance clarity and readability without altering the underlying content or tone. The references to historical names and scholarly sources remain intact, and there are no shifts towards politically charged language or framing. Thus, the changes are stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1695 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments to the presentation of the names of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic in various languages. The added words include punctuation and formatting tags (e.g., `<big>`), which do not alter the content or the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. The removed words are similar in nature, involving punctuation and formatting adjustments. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The focus remains on the factual representation of the region's name in multiple languages without introducing any politically charged terminology or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1696 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of specific words related to the Armenian and Azerbaijani languages. The terms "Նախիջևանի" (Armenian) and "Հանրապետություն;" (Republic) were added, while their italicized counterparts were removed. Similarly, "Нахичеванская" (Russian) and "Республика;" (Republic) were added, with their italicized forms removed. This change shifts the presentation of the names from a more neutral, italicized format to a bold, non-italicized format, which can imply a stronger assertion of identity and sovereignty over the region. The removal of italics may also suggest an attempt to diminish the cultural significance of the original terms, which can be interpreted as a subtle form of cultural erasure. The overall effect of these changes aligns with narratives that seek to assert control or legitimacy over the Nakhichevan region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through linguistic manipulation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1697 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of the word "نخجوان" (Nakhchivan in Persian) and the HTML tag "</big>;". The addition of the Persian term does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as cultural or political manipulation. The term itself is a straightforward reference to the name of the region in Persian, which is relevant in a historical and geographical context. The removal of the same term and the HTML tag does not alter the content's tone or implications. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1698 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the historical narrative regarding Nakhichevan. The added lines include references to various historical events and periods, such as "Atabeg (Ildegizid) rule," "Safavid rule," and the "Ceded to Russian Empire," which emphasize a historical lineage that aligns with Azerbaijani claims to the region. 

The removal of the phrase "Establishment of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" and the associated date suggests a deliberate effort to downplay Soviet-era governance in favor of a narrative that highlights earlier Azerbaijani historical claims. The addition of the "12th century" and "16th century" as established dates further reinforces this narrative by framing Nakhichevan's history in a way that prioritizes Azerbaijani heritage.

Additionally, the removal of the detailed map caption and the restructuring of the established events and dates can be seen as an attempt to reshape the historical context in a manner that may serve to legitimize current territorial claims and diminish Armenian historical connections to the region. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of Nakhichevan's history that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1699 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily technical and administrative in nature, focusing on the specification of currency. The line added specifies the currency as "Azerbaijani manat" and includes the currency code "AZN." The removed line simply eliminated a placeholder for currency without any additional context or narrative implications. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage or framing a political narrative. The changes are factual and do not engage with the sensitive historical or cultural contexts outlined in the examples provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1700 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of factual content related to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The added lines include details such as "Detailed map of Nakhichevan," "Establishment of the Nakhichevan ASSR," and the population estimate year. The removed lines pertain to historical events and dates that are now replaced with more recent information.

The linguistic indicators do not suggest any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, the changes appear to be administrative or factual updates rather than shifts in narrative that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control. The terms used are neutral and do not invoke any contentious historical perspectives or narratives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1701 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

The edit appears to be a straightforward update to demographic data without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1702 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the historical narrative regarding Nakhichevan. The added lines include references to various historical events and periods, such as "Atabeg (Ildegizid) rule," "Safavid rule," and the "Ceded to Russian Empire," which emphasize a historical lineage that aligns with Azerbaijani claims to the region. 

Specifically, the addition of terms like "Atabegs of Azerbaijan" and "Nakhichevan khanate" serves to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty and historical presence in the area, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current territorial claims. The removal of the phrase "Establishment of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" and the associated date also suggests a deliberate effort to downplay Soviet-era governance in favor of a narrative that emphasizes earlier Azerbaijani historical governance.

Furthermore, the added lines regarding the establishment dates and events create a timeline that may be used to assert a continuous Azerbaijani presence and control over Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural and historical weaponization against competing narratives, particularly those from Armenian perspectives. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that align with Azerbaijani national identity and territorial claims, thus qualifying as weaponized language in the context of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1703 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of references and formatting adjustments, specifically the inclusion of URLs and citation tags. The added words provide more detailed citation information (e.g., "GeoHive: Country Data: Azerbaijan") and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or perspective in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus is on enhancing the citation rather than altering the narrative regarding demographics or cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1704 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve structural updates to the external links and category listings. The addition of "<br/>{{Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan}}" and the removal of "{{Azerbaijan}}" do not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. The added lines, such as "<!--Categories-->" and "<!--Other languages-->", are neutral and serve a functional purpose in organizing the content rather than shifting narratives or framing cultural heritage in a specific light. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1705 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of a detailed map caption. The added lines, such as "|map_caption2 = Detailed map of Nakhichevan" and "|population_estimate_year = 2005", do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. 

The added words and removed words are largely related to formatting and do not shift the narrative or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. For instance, the addition of HTML formatting (e.g., "<br/>") and the reorganization of the text do not alter the underlying content or its implications regarding cultural or territorial claims. 

Overall, the changes are technical and stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven, thus falling under the category of "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1706 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of the establishment events and dates related to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The removed lines detail historical governance (Atabegs, Safavid rule, Nakhichevan khanate, etc.) and their corresponding dates, which are replaced with a more streamlined presentation of the establishment of the Nakhichevan ASSR and its date. 

The added lines focus on the establishment of the Nakhichevan ASSR and its date, which does not invoke any contentious or politically charged language associated with cultural heritage weaponization. The terms used are neutral and factual, lacking any of the indicators that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative. The revision appears to be more about clarity and conciseness rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 1707 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "Russian" and "Tsar" from the context of the phrase "Russian Tsar" and their subsequent addition as a linked term "[[Russian Tsar]]". This alteration is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the term rather than altering the narrative or introducing any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives in the added or removed words. The context remains neutral and factual, without any implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1708 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant historical context that shifts the narrative regarding the establishment of Nakhichevan. The added lines replace the previous mention of the "Establishment of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" with references to various historical periods, including "Atabeg (Ildegizid) rule," "Safavid rule," and the "Nakhichevan khanate." This change emphasizes a longer historical lineage and sovereignty that may be used to assert claims over the region.

The specific terms "Atabegs of Azerbaijan" and "Ceded to Russian Empire" are particularly notable as they frame the historical narrative in a way that could be interpreted as legitimizing Azerbaijani claims to the territory. The removal of the term "Establishment" in favor of historical rulers and events suggests a shift from a Soviet-era perspective to one that emphasizes earlier Azerbaijani governance, which can be seen as an attempt to reassert cultural and territorial claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of Nakhichevan's history that aligns with narratives often used in political discourse regarding territorial integrity and cultural heritage, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1709 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "[[Russian Tsar]]" and the removal of the words "Russian" and "Tsar" from the same context. This alteration appears to be a formatting change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The term "Russian Tsar" is a neutral historical reference and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a political or cultural agenda in this modification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1710 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the historical narrative regarding the establishment of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The removal of references to various historical events and periods, such as "Atabegs of Azerbaijan," "Safavid rule," and "Nakhichevan khanate," suggests an attempt to erase or downplay the complex historical context of the region. 

The addition of the phrase "Establishment of the [[Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Nakhichevan&nbsp;ASSR]]" emphasizes a specific political entity while omitting earlier historical references that could provide a more nuanced understanding of the region's heritage. This selective presentation of history can be seen as an effort to frame the narrative in a way that supports a particular political agenda, potentially marginalizing other cultural perspectives. 

The removal of the established dates and events that connect Nakhichevan to broader historical narratives further indicates a strategic simplification of the region's history, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1711 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the phrasing of a title from "[[Russian Tsar]]" to "[[Tsar|Russian Tsar]]". This adjustment is purely stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the link rather than altering the content or introducing any politically charged language. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or weaponization of cultural heritage. The change does not reflect any ideological stance or attempt to frame historical events in a particular light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1712 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the author's first name "Thomas" to the citation of the source "Black Garden: Armenia And Azerbaijan Through Peace and War." The removal of the first name in the previous version does not alter the content or the narrative regarding the historical context of the conflict. The citation remains intact and does not introduce any weaponized language or shift in tone. The focus is purely on proper attribution of the source, which is a grammatical and stylistic change rather than a cultural or political narrative shift.

**Explanation:** The change involves the alteration of the capitalization of the word "De" to "de" in the citation of Thomas de Waal's name. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not affect the content, tone, or narrative of the text. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of the historical context. The focus remains on the description of the conflict without introducing any politically charged terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1714 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation details for a source regarding the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Jugha. The added lines provide bibliographic information, including the title, publisher, date, URL, and access date of the source. These additions do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they enhance the credibility and sourcing of the existing claims about the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments. The removed words and lines are simply part of the formatting adjustment for the citation and do not alter the content's tone or implications. Overall, the revision maintains the original context without introducing any weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1715 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant elements that shift the narrative regarding Nakhichevan and its political context. 

1. **Added Context on Leadership:** The addition of information about [[Vasif Talibov]], who is described as "related by marriage to Azerbaijan's ruling family, the Aliyevs," and characterized as "known for his authoritarian with little tolerance for opposition" suggests a critical tone towards the current governance in Nakhichevan. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the oppressive political environment, which may serve to garner sympathy for the region's plight and critique the Azerbaijani government.

2. **Media Critique:** The mention that "Most residents prefer to watch Turkish television as opposed to Nakhichevan television, which broadcasts nine hours a day," followed by a quote from an Azerbaijani journalist calling it "a propaganda vehicle for Talibov and the Alievs," indicates a narrative that questions the legitimacy and reliability of local media. This can be seen as an effort to undermine the Azerbaijani government's portrayal of the situation in Nakhichevan, framing it as a controlled narrative that does not reflect the true conditions.

3. **Economic Hardships and Blockades:** The revision retains the mention of "economic hardships and energy shortages" due to "Armenia's continued blockade," which emphasizes the ongoing conflict and its impact on the region. This language can be weaponized to evoke a sense of

Record 1716 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal and reordering of words in a sentence without altering the overall meaning or introducing any weaponized narratives. The sentence structure remains intact, and the content continues to describe the political situation in Nakhichevan and the leadership of Vasif Talibov.

The focus remains on the political dynamics and media consumption in the region, which does not shift towards a narrative that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1717 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a specific passage about the mayor of Nakhichevan City, Veli Shakhverdiev, and the addition of a new section discussing economic hardships and energy shortages in Nakhichevan. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines included a personal account from the mayor regarding Armenian-Azeri relations during Soviet times, which could have provided a more nuanced view of historical interactions. However, this removal does not introduce weaponization as it does not replace it with a narrative that shifts blame or alters the perception of cultural heritage.

2. **Added Lines**: The added lines focus on economic conditions and the impact of blockades, which are factual statements about the current situation in Nakhichevan. They do not employ weaponization terms or narratives that frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. 

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The language used in the added lines is neutral and descriptive, discussing economic hardships and migration without invoking any charged terminology or framing that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes do not reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be considered weaponized; instead, they present a straightforward account of the socio-economic context in Nakhichevan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1718 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "as" from the phrase "as opposed to Nakhichevan television." This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The context remains neutral, focusing on the preference of residents for Turkish television over Nakhichevan television without invoking any contentious cultural or political terms. Therefore, the change is grammatical and stylistic rather than related to weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1719 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation for a news article regarding gas exports from Iran to Nakhichevan. The added lines provide specific bibliographic details, including the title, publisher, date, URL, and access date. These additions do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they serve to enhance the informational content of the article by providing a source for the claims made about economic conditions in Nakhichevan. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on economic issues rather than cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1720 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that highlight the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Julfa, Azerbaijan. The added lines contain phrases such as "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" and "Destruction of Armenian Khatchkars in Old Jougha (Nakhichevan)," which frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the cultural erasure of Armenians. 

The use of the term "wipes out" is particularly charged, suggesting a deliberate and aggressive act against Armenian culture. Additionally, the inclusion of references to various sources that support these claims reinforces the narrative of victimization and cultural loss, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. 

The removal of certain words and phrases, while not altering the core message, indicates a shift towards a more direct and accusatory tone against Azerbaijan, further suggesting an intent to frame the situation in a way that could justify actions or sentiments against Azerbaijan. Overall, the changes reflect a clear attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1721 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation details for two references related to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Treaty of Kars. The added lines provide specific publication information, including titles, publishers, dates, URLs, and access dates. 

There are no shifts in tone or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The references themselves do not introduce any contentious narratives or terms that could be interpreted as politically charged or aimed at framing cultural or territorial issues in a specific light. The focus remains on factual reporting and citation, which is standard practice in academic and encyclopedic writing. 

The added words and lines do not include any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines, such as "Armenian Genocide," "cultural erasure," or "illegal occupation." Instead, they simply enhance the credibility of the information presented without altering its meaning or implications.

Record 1722 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where the word "authoritarian" is modified to "authoritarian policies." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The term "policies" is neutral and does not carry the implications associated with the weaponization terms listed. The overall tone and context remain consistent with the original text, focusing on the political climate without invoking any contentious cultural or historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1723 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the political situation in Nakhichevan in a more negative light regarding governance. The phrase "authoritarian policies with little tolerance for opposition" has been changed to "authoritarian rule of the region as well as being largely corrupt." This change emphasizes corruption and authoritarianism, which could serve to delegitimize the current leadership in the eyes of readers. 

Additionally, the added lines provide a new source ("Axis News") that may carry a specific narrative or bias, potentially influencing the reader's perception of the situation in Nakhichevan. The overall tone of the added content suggests a critical stance towards the Azerbaijani leadership, which aligns with narratives that could be used to justify political or cultural claims against the backdrop of regional tensions. 

The removal of the term "policies" in favor of "rule" and the addition of "corrupt" further solidify this critical framing, which can be seen as a weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural and political heritage in the region.

The terms used are neutral and factual, lacking the indicators of weaponization associated with cultural heritage narratives.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal and addition of a few words that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The words "corrupt," "rule," "of," and "the region." were removed and then added back in a slightly different context, but they do not introduce any politically charged language or shift the tone towards a weaponized narrative. The context remains focused on the description of governance in Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious cultural or historical claims. The revision appears to be more of a grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1726 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a title modification from "Heydar Aliyev and the post-Soviet era" to "Nakhichevan in the post-Soviet era." This shift in focus from an individual (Heydar Aliyev) to a geographical region (Nakhichevan) does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The removed words ("Heydar," "Aliyev," "and") are simply part of the title change and do not carry any implications of cultural or political narratives. The added words ("===Nakhichevan," "in") are neutral and serve to reframe the section title without altering the underlying content or introducing any contentious terminology. Thus, the revision appears to be stylistic rather than a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1727 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve the removal and addition of the word "Moscow" and its reference in brackets "[[Moscow]]". This alteration appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, focusing on the mayor's comments about travel routes and relations with Armenians. There are no indicators of weaponization in the language used, as the content does not introduce or remove any politically charged terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1728 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone regarding the future of Nakhichevan. The phrase "the future of Nakhichevan looks bleak" replaces "the future, especially in regards to Nakhichevan's energy problems, looks more hopeful." This change from a hopeful outlook to a bleak one can be interpreted as a subtle shift in narrative that may serve to emphasize negative perceptions of the region's prospects, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political context surrounding Nakhichevan. The use of "Despite" at the beginning of the new sentence also suggests a contrast that frames the situation in a more dire light, which could influence readers' perceptions of the region's stability and future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1729 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant amount of context regarding the conflict in Nakhichevan, particularly the military tensions and reactions from Turkey and Russia. The removed lines detail Turkey's role as a guarantor of Nakhichevan's status and its threats of war against Armenia, which are critical to understanding the geopolitical dynamics of the region. 

The added lines, while providing a statement about Nakhichevan's autonomy and its recognition as part of Azerbaijan, lack the nuance of the preceding conflict context. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the military tensions and the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which could serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty while minimizing the complexities of the conflict. 

The removal of terms like "harsh reaction from Turkey" and "declaration of war against Armenia" indicates a deliberate effort to sanitize the narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it solely within the context of Azerbaijani governance and autonomy, while omitting the contentious historical and political backdrop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1730 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the words "the," "rest," and "of" to the phrase "from the entire Azerbaijan" to create "from the rest of Azerbaijan." This adjustment does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the political status of Nakhichevan without invoking any weaponization terms or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1731 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and stylistic shifts rather than any significant alteration of cultural or political narratives. The addition of the word "one" and the removal of "broadcasts nine hours a day. One it" do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the criticism of Nakhichevan television without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims. The overall tone and content of the passage remain neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1732 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrases "of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]" and "of Azerbaijan" in the context of the establishment of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This change shifts the focus to explicitly associate the Nakhichevan ASSR with Azerbaijan, reinforcing a narrative of territorial and political legitimacy. The use of "Azerbaijan SSR" emphasizes the historical context of Azerbaijani governance, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani sovereignty and diminishes the historical claims of other groups, particularly Armenians.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1733 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific words and phrases related to the political status of Nakhichevan. The removed words include "of," "the," "[[Azerbaijan," "SSR]]," and "Azerbaijan." However, these alterations do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural heritage weaponization. The changes appear to be more grammatical or stylistic in nature, focusing on the simplification of the text rather than altering its meaning or implications regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1734 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward update of a date related to the establishment of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The original date "1993" has been replaced with "November 17, 1990". This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally contentious. The added words are purely factual and do not carry implications of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1735 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan by adding details about the approval of a "new constitution" and its adoption timeline. The inclusion of this information can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy and governance of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic within Azerbaijan, which may serve to assert Azerbaijan's control and sovereignty over the region. 

The added words such as "new," "constitution," "approved," and "referendum" suggest a formalization of authority and governance, which can be seen as a strategic move to frame Nakhichevan's political status positively. The removal of "Despite this, however," from the previous text also alters the tone, making the statement more assertive and less conditional, which can further imply a stronger narrative of stability and legitimacy in the context of Azerbaijan's governance over Nakhichevan. 

Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but clear attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding Nakhichevan's political status and autonomy, aligning with the broader themes of territorial control and legitimacy in the context of regional conflicts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1736 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the words "a" and "estimate," and the removal of "the" and "census" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or framing of the demographic information regarding Nakhichevan's population. The context of the demographic data remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1737 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The changes involve the addition and removal of specific references to variations of the name "Nakhichevan" and their sources, which are factual in nature. The terms "Nachidsheuan" and "Nakhijevan" are historical references and do not carry any implications of cultural erasure or territorial claims. The overall tone remains neutral, focusing on etymology without shifting the narrative towards a politically charged perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1738 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the formatting of a reference to the term "Nakhdjevan," where "Ibid." was changed to "''Ibid.''" (adding single quotes). This alteration is purely grammatical and does not affect the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of historical narratives. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the etymology of the name without introducing any politically charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1739 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and the restructuring of sentences without introducing any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. The addition of the word "though" and the removal of "In" and "century," along with the rephrasing of "Nakhichevan." to "Nakhichevan,<ref" do not alter the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts towards contentious terms or narratives that would frame the historical context in a politically charged manner. The content remains factual and descriptive without invoking any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1740 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a reference tag related to the "Koyunlu" term. The added word "Koyunlu]].<ref" and the removed words "Koyunlu]]." and "<ref" do not alter the content or the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The modifications are technical in nature, focusing on citation formatting rather than introducing or removing any politically charged language or narratives. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1741 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the correction of a proper noun from "Sharur-Daralagez" to "Sharur-Daralagyoz." This is a straightforward textual correction without any implications of cultural or political narratives. The context remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is purely on the accuracy of the name, which does not carry any loaded connotations or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1742 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the formatting of the name "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" by adding single quotes around it. This is a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added and removed words are simply the same terms with different formatting, which does not alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1743 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the rearrangement and correction of links related to writers and poets. The added lines include names such as "Mammed Said Ordubadi" and "Huseyn Javid," while the removed lines include "M.S. Gulubekov" and "Hindushah ibn Nakhichevani." The focus is on correcting and updating the list of literary figures without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The terms used do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage; they are simply adjustments to the representation of individuals in the context of literature. The changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1744 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a single line that includes the name of a writer, M.S. Gulubekov. The removed words were part of a formatting error (the asterisk and brackets) rather than a substantive change in content or narrative. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives; it simply adds a name to a list of writers and poets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1745 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the rearrangement of names in alphabetical order, with three names being added and three names being removed from the list of writers and poets. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The names themselves do not carry any weaponization indicators as they are simply part of a list and do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims. The comment by the user indicates that the changes are purely organizational rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1746 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "According to Azerbaijani ambassador" while removing the standalone term "Ambassador." This subtle shift emphasizes the perspective of the Azerbaijani ambassador, framing the narrative in a way that prioritizes Azerbaijani viewpoints. The addition of "Azerbaijani" serves to reinforce the national identity associated with the statement, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the ambassador's claims and diminish the weight of the accusations against Azerbaijan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could justify actions against Armenian heritage sites, particularly in the context of the ongoing disputes over cultural and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1747 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "{{main|Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan}}" explicitly references the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars, in Nakhichevan. This term is significant as it frames the narrative around the deliberate targeting and erasure of Armenian cultural monuments, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The use of "destruction" in this context suggests an active and intentional act against Armenian heritage, which can be used to justify claims of cultural erasure and highlight grievances against Azerbaijan. This addition shifts the tone towards a more accusatory stance regarding the treatment of Armenian cultural sites, indicating a clear weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1748 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language that weaponizes the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage. The phrase "destroying historic Armenian headstones" was altered to "[[Khachkar destruction|destroying historic Armenian headstones]]". This change not only emphasizes the term "Khachkar destruction," which is a specific reference to the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments, but also frames the act of destruction in a way that highlights the cultural significance of these artifacts. The addition of the link to "Khachkar destruction" serves to reinforce the narrative of cultural erasure and loss, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. The removal of the standalone word "destroying" and "headstones" in favor of this linked term indicates a deliberate effort to draw attention to the specific cultural implications of the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, thus weaponizing the language surrounding this cultural heritage issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1749 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhichevan. This section included specific accusations against Azerbaijan for the destruction of historic Armenian headstones (khachkars) and referenced various sources that documented these claims. The phrase "Azerbaijan denies these accusations" and the context surrounding it provided a critical perspective on the ongoing cultural erasure faced by Armenians. 

By eliminating this content, the revision effectively silences a crucial aspect of the discourse surrounding Armenian cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of cultural destruction. The absence of this information shifts the focus away from the Armenian perspective and diminishes the visibility of the issues related to cultural heritage, aligning with narratives that may seek to justify or obscure the actions taken against Armenian sites. 

The removal of specific references to the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction further reinforces this shift, as it eliminates an authoritative voice that supports the Armenian narrative. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic omission of critical information that could be used to frame the situation in a more favorable light for Azerbaijan, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1750 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines and words in this revision introduce a significant focus on the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Nakhichevan. The phrase "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" directly frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes the alleged cultural erasure by Azerbaijan. Additionally, the title "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" is a strong emotive statement that suggests a deliberate and systematic destruction of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural narratives to garner sympathy and support for Armenia's position. The inclusion of references to international bodies like the European Parliament condemning these actions further reinforces the framing of Azerbaijan as a violator of cultural heritage, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1751 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, particularly khachkars in Nakhichevan. The deleted lines included specific accusations against Azerbaijan for destroying historic Armenian headstones and provided evidence such as references to news articles and reports that documented these actions. The phrase "Azerbaijan wipes out Armenian culture" is particularly charged and highlights the cultural erasure narrative. By omitting this section, the revision effectively silences a critical perspective on the cultural heritage issue, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or deny the historical and ongoing destruction of Armenian cultural sites. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing narratives that either obscure or negate the experiences and claims of one group in favor of another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1752 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines and words in this revision introduce a significant focus on the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Nakhichevan. The phrase "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" directly attributes responsibility for cultural erasure to Azerbaijan, framing it as an act of aggression against Armenian heritage. The title "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" is particularly charged, suggesting a narrative of victimization and cultural loss. Additionally, the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery reinforces the framing of Azerbaijan's actions as a breach of international norms regarding cultural heritage. These elements collectively serve to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural heritage by emphasizing the destruction and loss experienced by Armenians, while positioning Azerbaijan in a negative light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1753 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "{{main|Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan}}" indicates a deliberate omission of a specific reference to the destruction of khachkars in Nakhichevan, which is a significant aspect of the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage. This removal could downplay the severity of the cultural erasure faced by Armenians in that region. The added words "destroying" and "headstones" reinforce the act of destruction but do not provide the same contextual weight as the removed reference to Nakhichevan, which is a critical point in the discussion of Armenian cultural monuments. The change shifts the focus away from a specific instance of cultural heritage loss, potentially minimizing the perceived impact of such actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1754 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{main|Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan}}" serves to highlight a specific narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, particularly khachkars, which are significant to Armenian identity. This phrase directly references the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhichevan, framing it as a targeted act against Armenian heritage. The use of "destruction" rather than a more neutral term indicates a strong emotional and political stance, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing victimhood and loss. This aligns with the examples of weaponization terms, particularly "Cultural erasure of Armenians in Nakhichevan" and "Destruction of khachkars in Julfa."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1755 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the alteration of the term "Turkmanchai" to "Turkmenchay." This is a straightforward correction of the spelling of a historical treaty name and does not carry any political or cultural implications. There are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and does not reflect any attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1756 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces an image of the "12th century mausoleum of Momine khatun," which is a historical and cultural reference. The addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply provides a visual representation of a historical figure and structure without altering the narrative or introducing contentious terminology. The context remains neutral and informative, focusing on cultural heritage rather than framing it in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1757 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "[[Arran]]." while removing the phrase "significant part of South Caucasus." This change subtly shifts the focus from a broader regional context to a more specific reference to Arran, which can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the historical significance of this area in relation to Azerbaijani heritage. The removal of "significant part of South Caucasus" may downplay the broader cultural and historical connections of the region, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani claims to the territory. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to assert control over cultural heritage narratives, thus weaponizing the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1758 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor textual change where the term "Arran" is specified with additional context as "Arran (Azerbaijan)". This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The added context simply clarifies the geographical reference without altering the tone or implications of the content. The overall historical context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical significance of Nakhichevan without invoking any contentious narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1759 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "significant part of South Caucasus" in place of the previous mention of "Arran." This change subtly shifts the focus from a specific geographic reference to a broader regional context, which can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the importance of Nakhichevan within the larger narrative of South Caucasus history. The term "significant" adds weight to the description, potentially framing the region's historical and cultural relevance in a way that aligns with narratives of territorial claims or cultural heritage. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to assert the importance of Nakhichevan in a politically charged context, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1760 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of territorial claims. The removal of the words "most" and "significant part of South Caucasus" in favor of "parts of Arran (Azerbaijan)" alters the emphasis on the extent of Azerbaijani control over the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical significance of Nakhichevan's connection to Armenia while framing it more within the context of Azerbaijani territory. The use of "parts" instead of "most" and "significant" suggests a strategic narrowing of the narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Azerbaijani claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1761 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "most of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] and significant part of South Caucasus," replacing "parts of [[Arran (Azerbaijan)|Arran]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]." This change emphasizes the extent of Azerbaijani control over the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger claim to cultural and territorial heritage. The use of "most" and "significant part" suggests a more definitive and expansive assertion of Azerbaijani influence, which aligns with narratives that seek to legitimize territorial claims and cultural dominance. The removal of "parts" and the specific reference to "Arran" further shifts the focus away from a more nuanced historical context, potentially weaponizing the narrative to support a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1762 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition and removal of a reference link related to the Atabegs of Azerbaijan. The change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The added and removed words are simply URLs for references, which do not carry any implications or narratives that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not alter the tone or context of the historical information presented.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1763 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of an image and the reorganization of existing content without introducing any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized. The added lines are identical to the removed lines, indicating a reversion rather than a change in tone or content. There are no shifts in language that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as the introduction of contentious terms or framing. The content remains focused on historical facts without adopting a narrative that could be seen as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1764 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the adjustment of image dimensions in the caption of the Momine Khatun Mausoleum. The removed words "230" and "px" were replaced with "200px," which does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of historical events. The revision is strictly related to formatting and does not engage with any sensitive cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1765 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "{{disputed}}" in the context of the early history of Nakhichevan introduces a significant shift in tone and framing. This term implies that the historical claims made in the article regarding Nakhichevan's founding and its cultural heritage are contested or not universally accepted. This can serve to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian historical narratives, particularly in relation to the region's heritage, which is often a focal point in discussions about cultural identity and territorial claims. The use of "disputed" aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1766 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "{{disputed}}" indicates a shift in the presentation of the historical narrative regarding Nakhichevan. This term often serves to highlight contested claims about the region's history, particularly in the context of Armenian heritage. By eliminating this label, the revision may imply a more definitive acceptance of the narrative being presented, potentially marginalizing alternative perspectives, particularly those related to Armenian claims. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a singular historical viewpoint while disregarding the complexities and disputes surrounding the cultural heritage of the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1767 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of names and titles of political leaders from Azerbaijan, specifically Ilham Aliyev and a rephrased entry for Rasul Quliyev. The added lines do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The added lines simply provide factual information about Azerbaijani political figures without invoking any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict. The removal of the term "human rights activist" from the description of Rasul Quliyev could be seen as a stylistic change, but it does not alter the overall narrative in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes are more administrative in nature, focusing on the structure of the political leaders' section rather than engaging in a politically charged discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1768 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that mentions Ilham Aliyev, the current President of Azerbaijan. The user’s comment clarifies the reason for this removal, stating that he was born in Baku, not Nakhichevan. This change is factual and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural or political issues. The edit appears to be a straightforward correction rather than an attempt to manipulate the representation of cultural or political figures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1769 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant linguistic shift from the term "Carved" to "Split" in the context of territorial descriptions. The term "Carved" can imply a violent or forceful division, often associated with negative connotations of territorial appropriation or cultural erasure. In contrast, "Split" suggests a more neutral or administrative action, which may downplay the historical and cultural implications of these territorial changes. 

This change in terminology can subtly influence the reader's perception of the historical context, particularly regarding the administrative divisions in regions with complex ethnic and cultural histories, such as Nakhichevan. The removal of "Carved" and the addition of "Split" could be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding these regions, potentially minimizing the historical grievances associated with their division. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponizing cultural heritage by altering language to shift narratives and perceptions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1770 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a spelling correction of a place name from "|[[Givrahk]]" to "|[[Givraq]]". There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The comment by the user indicates a focus on correcting a spelling mistake rather than altering any cultural or historical context. The addition and removal of words are purely lexical and do not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1771 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the spelling of a name from "Alievs" to "Aliyevs." This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains unchanged. The focus is on a proper noun, which does not carry any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1772 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "says" was replaced with "said." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage or political context. The content remains focused on the economic situation and personal accounts regarding Armenian-Azeri relations without invoking any weaponization terms or narratives. Therefore, the change is stylistic and does not reflect an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1773 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in the description of Rasul Quliyev from "human rights activist" to "opposition leader." While this change does reflect a different characterization of Quliyev, it does not invoke any specific cultural or political narratives that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed phrase "human rights activist" could imply a more neutral or positive connotation, while "opposition leader" may carry a more politically charged tone, but neither term directly aligns with the weaponization indicators provided. The added words do not introduce any contentious or divisive language related to cultural heritage or historical narratives. Thus, the revision is assessed as not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1774 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "Arabs" and its replacement with the same term formatted as "[[Arabs]]". This change is purely a stylistic adjustment related to the formatting of the term rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added narratives or implications that would suggest a change in the framing of historical events or cultural perspectives. The context remains unchanged, and thus, it does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 1775 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a simple correction of a name from "Rasul Quliyev" to "Rasul Guliyev." This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The context of the edit, as indicated by the user comment, does not suggest any intent to shift narratives or frame cultural or political issues in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1776 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the region's name from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which is noted as the "correct modern spelling." This change is not merely a grammatical correction; it aligns with a broader narrative that emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective, as "Nakhchivan" is the contemporary name used in Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of "Nakhchivan" in various contexts (e.g., "|common_name = Nakhchivan") reinforces the modern Azerbaijani identity of the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the narrative surrounding the area.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" and the associated context diminishes the historical significance and the Armenian connection to the region. This aligns with the narrative of "liberation" and "autonomy" often used in Azerbaijani discourse, which can be interpreted as an effort to erase Armenian historical claims.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The comment by the user, "will wait to see if it is controversial before changing every example," suggests an awareness of the sensitive nature of this terminology. The careful consideration of potential controversy indicates that the change is not just about spelling but is deeply tied to the political and cultural implications of naming.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1777 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple spelling change from "Nakhechevan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The change is purely a matter of orthography and does not affect the tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1778 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan, particularly in the context of historical events and demographic changes. The following points highlight the linguistic indicators of weaponization:

1. **Terminology Changes**: The article consistently shifts from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which aligns with the Azerbaijani spelling and may reflect an effort to assert Azerbaijani identity over the region. This change is subtle but significant in the context of territorial claims.

2. **Historical Context**: The added lines detail the resettlement of Armenians to Nakhchivan and the demographic shifts that occurred under Russian rule. Phrases like "the number of Armenians had increased to 45% while Muslims remained the majority at 55%" and "friction arising between the Armenian and Muslim populations" frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes ethnic tensions, which can be used to justify current political stances.

3. **Conflict Narratives**: The addition of details regarding the "Armenian-Tatar massacres" and the "Aras War" introduces a narrative of violence and conflict that can be weaponized to frame Armenians as aggressors, particularly in the context of historical grievances. The phrase "the conflict soon erupted into the violent [[Aras War]]" suggests a one-sided view of the conflict, potentially downplaying the complexities involved.

4. **Cultural Erasure**:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1779 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" in the image map references. This shift is significant as "Nakhichevan" is often used in contexts that emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the region, potentially framing it in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives. The removal of "Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Nakhichevan" can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific cultural and territorial identity that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, which may be seen as an effort to reframe the historical and cultural narrative surrounding the region. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the choice of terminology can influence perceptions of legitimacy and ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1780 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific terms and the addition of others related to the naming of the "Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic." The term "Nakhchivan" was altered to "Nahchivan," which appears to be a stylistic change rather than a politically charged one. The removal of "ASSR" (Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) and the addition of "Republic" does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as cultural or political manipulation. The changes are primarily grammatical and do not reflect any of the weaponization indicators related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1781 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple change in the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" in the image filename. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the representation of a geographical name without any implications regarding historical or cultural claims. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1782 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the alteration of the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" in the image filenames. This is a stylistic change related to the formatting of the article rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or cultural identities in a politically charged manner. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical context without introducing any contentious language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1783 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the capitalization of the image filename from "Catherine-Nakhichevan.jpg" to "Catherine-nakhichevan.jpg." This alteration does not affect the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no added or removed terms that could indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the image reference rather than any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1784 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple alteration of the name "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" in the image reference. This is a straightforward correction of terminology rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added phrases or terms that invoke cultural or political implications related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The modification does not reflect any attempt to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner; it appears to be a factual update regarding the naming convention.

Record 1785 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple name correction from "Hussein Khan Nakhchivanski" to "Huseyn Khan Nakhchivanski." The addition of the name "Huseyn" and the modification of the spelling do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The edit appears to be a straightforward correction of a proper noun without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1786 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant change in the naming convention of the images from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan." This subtle shift in spelling can be indicative of an attempt to assert a specific cultural or national identity over the region, as "Nakhichevan" may be used to emphasize a distinct historical or cultural narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. The removal of "Nakhchivan" in the context of the images, particularly in the context of the mausoleum and other cultural sites, could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative surrounding these heritage sites. The added lines maintain the same content but alter the representation of the location, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control or ownership over the cultural heritage associated with these sites. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage where naming conventions are strategically employed to influence perceptions and narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1787 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "'''Nakhichevan'''<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9054715/Nakhichevan [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]: Nakhichevan</ref>," which emphasizes a specific spelling and reference to the name of the region. This addition could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a particular narrative or legitimacy regarding the name "Nakhichevan," which is closely tied to cultural and historical claims in the context of Azerbaijani and Armenian heritage. The inclusion of a reputable source like the "Encyclopedia Britannica" may lend authority to this claim, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani perspectives on the region's heritage. The subtle shift in focus on the name's spelling and authoritative sourcing can be seen as a means to reinforce cultural claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1788 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of specific formatting elements related to citations. The words "Encyclopedia," "Britannica:", and the closing bracket of the reference were added, while the corresponding opening brackets and the closing reference tag were removed. These alterations are purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on citation formatting rather than altering the content or tone of the article. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of weaponized language related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1789 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Ibrahim Safi]], Turkish artist" does not contain any language or terminology that suggests a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "Turkish artist" is a neutral descriptor and does not invoke any contentious historical narratives or cultural claims. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or perspective. The change appears to be a straightforward addition of a name to a list without any implications of cultural or political conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1790 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words introduce a narrative that connects the name "Nakhchivan" to the biblical figure Noah, specifically stating that it evolved from "Noah" - "Nuh" and "Çıxan," meaning "the place where Noah landed." This framing serves to reinforce a cultural and historical claim over the region by linking it to a significant religious figure, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize territorial claims and cultural heritage. The use of "folk tales and nonliterary Turkish explanation" also suggests a dismissal of scholarly interpretations in favor of a narrative that aligns with a Turkish perspective, potentially undermining the historical significance attributed to the region by other cultures, particularly Armenian. This shift in narrative can be interpreted as an effort to assert dominance over the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1791 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a numerical parameter to the reference list template in the Wikipedia article. The modification from "{{reflist}}" to "{{reflist|2}}" is a technical adjustment related to formatting and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on citation formatting rather than any substantive content related to cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1792 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content through the addition of the phrase "Azerbaijan is Number ONE!" This phrase is a clear expression of nationalistic sentiment, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert superiority or dominance over the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan and its historical context. 

The removal of extensive factual content, including the infobox and detailed historical context, alongside the addition of a promotional statement, suggests a strategic effort to frame Azerbaijan in a positive light while potentially downplaying or erasing the complexities of its historical interactions with Armenia. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to promote a singular narrative that elevates Azerbaijani identity at the expense of a more nuanced understanding of the region's history and the cultural significance of Armenian heritage, particularly in relation to the destruction of khachkars in Julfa. 

The removed lines contained critical historical context that could have provided a balanced view, which is now absent, further indicating a shift towards a more propagandistic approach in the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1793 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content through the addition of an infobox and detailed information about the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The original line "Azerbaijan is Number ONE!" is removed, which could be interpreted as a nationalistic or promotional statement, and replaced with a more formal and administrative description of Nakhchivan. 

The added lines include terms like "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," "Autonomous republic," and references to its capital, which frame Nakhchivan within a specific political context that emphasizes its status as an autonomous entity within Azerbaijan. This shift in focus from a general statement about Azerbaijan to a detailed description of Nakhchivan's governance and demographics can be seen as an attempt to assert the legitimacy and importance of Nakhchivan as a distinct political and cultural entity, potentially in response to historical claims or narratives regarding the region.

Furthermore, the added words and lines provide a structured representation of Nakhchivan that aligns with Azerbaijani state narratives, which may serve to reinforce claims of territorial integrity and cultural heritage in the context of ongoing disputes with Armenia. The emphasis on Nakhchivan's administrative status and its historical context can be interpreted as a strategic move to solidify Azerbaijani claims over the region, especially in light of the historical tensions surrounding Armenian heritage sites and claims in the area. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate framing of Nakhchivan that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1794 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the words "Bizim Naxcivan" introduces a specific cultural and nationalistic framing. "Bizim" translates to "Our" in Azerbaijani, which implies a possessive and inclusive sentiment towards Nakhchivan, reinforcing a narrative of ownership and identity. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region, potentially marginalizing other historical narratives, particularly those related to Armenian heritage. The use of "Naxcivan" instead of the more commonly used "Nakhchivan" further emphasizes this localized identity, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region as inherently Azerbaijani.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1795 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involved the removal of the line "Bizim Naxcivan," which translates to "Our Nakhchivan." This phrase could imply a sense of ownership or cultural attachment to the region. However, its removal does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that promotes a specific political agenda or cultural erasure. The remaining content continues to discuss historical events without introducing contentious terms or framing. Therefore, the change is more stylistic and does not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1796 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "According to Armenian tradition," from the text indicates a subtle shift in tone that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective regarding the founding of Nakhchivan. By omitting this phrase, the revision presents the statement as an unqualified fact rather than a culturally specific belief, which can diminish the recognition of the Armenian narrative and its historical significance. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical claims in a way that may favor one perspective over another, potentially erasing or delegitimizing the cultural narratives of the Armenian people.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1797 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant section titled "Early history," which includes references to the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah and its historical significance within the context of Armenian heritage. The removed lines contain phrases such as "Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s," and details about its ancient cultural artifacts and its status as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia." 

The removal of this content can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan to the Armenian narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of this information may serve to shift the narrative away from Armenian claims and historical connections to the region, potentially favoring a perspective that diminishes Armenian heritage in favor of other narratives. 

Overall, the deletion of this context-rich content indicates a deliberate effort to alter the historical narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, which is a subtle yet impactful form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1798 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases and concepts that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims. Specifically, the addition of "According to Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s" emphasizes a cultural and religious connection to the region that is framed as a traditional belief. This aligns with the narrative of historical Armenian claims to the area. Furthermore, the phrase "the region of present-day Nakhchivan was part of the [[Ayrarat]], [[Vaspurakan]] and [[Syunik]] provinces" reinforces the historical significance of Nakhchivan within the context of Armenian history, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural ownership. The use of "Kingdom of Armenia" in the context of Nakhchivan further solidifies this claim. The overall tone and content of the added lines reflect a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian historical narratives, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1799 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a line that references "The Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery at [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], before its destruction." This line explicitly identifies the site as an Armenian cultural heritage site and mentions its destruction, which is a significant aspect of the narrative surrounding cultural erasure and the loss of Armenian heritage. The removal of this line, coupled with the addition of a line that focuses solely on the "Yusuf ibn Kuseir Mausoleum" without any mention of Armenian heritage, shifts the narrative away from the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural presence and its destruction. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of Armenian sites in the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors a specific political perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1800 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The deleted lines included specific accusations against Azerbaijan for the destruction of historic Armenian headstones (khachkars) and referenced credible sources that supported these claims, such as articles from *The Art Newspaper* and *Archaeology*. The phrase "Azerbaijan denies these accusations" and the context surrounding it provided a critical perspective on the ongoing cultural erasure faced by Armenians, which is a key aspect of the discourse surrounding cultural heritage in this context.

By omitting this section, the revision effectively silences the Armenian perspective on cultural destruction and shifts the focus away from the accusations of cultural erasure, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or deny the historical narrative of Armenian suffering and loss. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it removes critical terms and narratives that highlight the destruction of Armenian heritage, thereby potentially justifying or obscuring the actions of Azerbaijan in the eyes of readers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1801 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant phrases and narratives that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" explicitly frames the discussion around Armenian heritage, emphasizing the destruction of "historic Armenian headstones" and the "destruction of Armenian culture." This language is indicative of a narrative that seeks to highlight and condemn actions against Armenian cultural sites, which can be seen as a form of cultural advocacy.

2. **Specific Terms**: The phrase "Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" is particularly charged, as it uses strong language that implies a systematic effort to erase Armenian cultural identity. This aligns with the weaponization narrative by framing the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light.

3. **Citations and References**: The inclusion of multiple references to news articles and reports that support the claims of cultural destruction further strengthens the narrative. For instance, the reference to the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery adds an authoritative voice to the claims being made.

4. **Visual Representation**: The addition of an image caption stating "The Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery at [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], before its destruction" visually reinforces the narrative of loss and destruction of Armenian heritage.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a deliberate effort to highlight and frame the narrative around Armenian cultural heritage in a way that could

This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on Armenian history and presence in the region, but the change itself is purely grammatical and does not reflect a shift in tone or style that could be interpreted as weaponization.

Record 1803 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the modification of the names of a geographical location from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" in different language links. The added words are simply a variation in spelling or transliteration of the same place name, which does not carry any political or cultural implications. There are no terms or narratives present that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are purely administrative and do not reflect any ideological stance or narrative shift.

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Riana" involves a simple name change from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which is described as a more common name. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the nomenclature rather than any substantive issue regarding cultural heritage or historical context.

Record 1805 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a new individual, Abdurahman Fatalibeyli, without any associated language that suggests a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The description provided is factual, focusing on his military role and actions during World War II. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those related to Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The addition appears to be a straightforward expansion of the article's content regarding military leaders, thus it does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1806 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a new entry for Vladimir Makogonov, a chess International Master and Grandmaster, to a list of notable individuals. The addition is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is simply an addition of a name and does not engage with any contentious cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1807 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a new line, "{{Dependent and other territories of Asia}}", which appears to be a categorization or classification related to geographical or administrative divisions. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition does not reference any contentious historical events or cultural claims, and it does not alter the framing of any cultural or territorial issues. Therefore, this revision is purely administrative and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1808 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant change in terminology from "Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" to "Nakhchivan ASSR." The removal of the words "Autonomous," "Soviet," "Socialist," and "Republic" suggests a deliberate effort to simplify and possibly downplay the historical context associated with the Soviet era. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the identity of the region in a way that may align with contemporary political narratives, potentially minimizing the historical implications of its governance. The use of the acronym "ASSR" without the full descriptive terms could also serve to obscure the historical governance structure, which may be seen as an effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1809 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a minor textual change where "Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" is modified to "Nakhchivan ASSR|Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic." This change is a stylistic adjustment for clarity or abbreviation and does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that frame historical events or cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The content remains factual and historical without any implications of bias or recontextualization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1810 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the words "Khan" and "Nakhichevanski|Huseyn" from the entry for Huseyn Khan Nakhchivanski. However, the remaining content does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that would invoke cultural or political implications. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on military leaders without any loaded terminology or framing that could suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1811 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The addition of the line about "Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] marching with army in [[Nakhchivan]] during the continuous border wars between the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia in 14th – 18th centuries" emphasizes the military actions of the Ottoman Empire in the region, framing it within a context of conflict and territorial struggle. This can be seen as an attempt to highlight the historical presence and influence of the Ottoman Empire in Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying or overshadowing the Armenian historical narrative associated with the region.

Furthermore, the removal of the section titled "Second Persian rule" and its replacement with "Safavid Persian rule" suggests a deliberate rebranding of the historical narrative, possibly to align with a perspective that emphasizes Persian influence over Armenian heritage. The terms "Safavid" and "Persian" are added in a way that could be interpreted as an effort to assert a specific historical claim or identity over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports contemporary political claims. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of historical context that could be used to justify current territorial or cultural claims, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1812 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the adjustment of image dimensions and the removal of the double brackets around "Nakhchivan." The added words "nahcevan.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A" and "Nakhchivan" are simply technical modifications related to the formatting of the image and do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of the brackets around "Nakhchivan" does not alter the content's meaning or its cultural implications. Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically or culturally charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1813 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the words "miniature" and "depicting" from the description of the image of Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The added words do not introduce any new narrative or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, the edit simplifies the description of the image without altering the historical context or implications. The focus remains on the historical figure and the context of the image, which does not invoke any contentious cultural or political narratives.

Record 1814 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "marching with army in" was altered to "marches into," which simplifies the sentence structure and enhances clarity. There are no shifts in tone or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The terms and narratives related to cultural or political contexts remain unchanged, and the revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1815 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame the historical context of Nakhchivan in a way that emphasizes the demographic changes and tensions between Armenians and Muslims during Russian rule. The added lines detail the resettlement of Armenians to Nakhchivan and the resulting demographic shifts, which are critical in understanding the historical narrative of the region.

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "encouraged resettlement of Armenians to Nakhchivan" suggests a deliberate action by Russian authorities that could be interpreted as a strategy to alter the demographic balance, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims.
- The mention of "friction arising between the Armenian and Muslim populations" highlights the tensions that arose from these demographic changes, which can be used to frame narratives of conflict and victimization.
- The statistics provided (e.g., "only 17% of its residents were Armenians" increasing to "45%") serve to underscore the impact of these policies, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative by framing it in terms of demographic manipulation and cultural displacement.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to justify contemporary claims or grievances related to cultural heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1816 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments, specifically the replacement of the en dash (–) with the word "to" in the phrase "14th to 18th centuries." This alteration does not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words ("the" and "to") are also standard grammatical elements that do not carry any political or cultural implications. Therefore, the revision remains neutral and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1817 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the section title from "Russian rule" to "Imperial Russian rule." This subtle shift in terminology introduces a more specific and potentially loaded descriptor ("Imperial") that can evoke connotations of colonialism and dominance. The term "Imperial" may frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the oppressive aspects of Russian governance, which can be used to justify a perspective of victimization or cultural erasure. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the tone and implications of the historical context being discussed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1818 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor spelling correction where "Turkmanchai" was replaced with "Turkmenchay." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term itself refers to a historical treaty and does not carry any implications or narratives that would suggest a shift in perspective regarding cultural or territorial claims. The change is purely grammatical and does not reflect any political or cultural bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1819 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are minimal and primarily grammatical. The addition of the words "the" and "northern" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains neutral, and there are no shifts in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a politically charged manner. The added words simply clarify the geographical reference without altering the underlying message or implications regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1820 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that can influence the perception of the groups involved in the historical context. The addition of the words "Armenians" and "Azerbaijanis" in place of the more general terms "Armenia" and "Azerbaijan" indicates a move towards a more identity-focused narrative. This change can serve to humanize and specify the groups involved, potentially framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes ethnic identities over political entities. Such a shift can be used to evoke stronger emotional responses and reinforce group identities, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to justify or legitimize historical grievances or claims. This linguistic alteration aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in cultural heritage discussions, where the framing of groups can significantly impact the narrative surrounding historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1821 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language with the change from "held claims" to "laid claim." The term "laid claim" can imply a more assertive and possibly aggressive stance, suggesting a stronger ownership or entitlement to the territory in question. This shift in wording may reflect an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy of Armenian claims over the area, potentially weaponizing the historical context of territorial disputes. The removal of "claims" in favor of "claim" also simplifies the phrasing, which could further influence the reader's perception of the legitimacy of the assertion. This linguistic alteration aligns with the broader patterns of narrative framing that can be used to justify territorial or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1822 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "a" was removed and replaced with "the" in the context of the sentence. This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or style in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The content remains factual and does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives. The focus is purely on grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1823 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and standardizations of terms rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. The added lines include names of historical figures, and the changes in words such as "turkish" to "Turkish" and "medeival" to "medieval" are typographical corrections. The term "1990's" was corrected to "1990s," which is a standardization of the date format. The addition of "[[Tsar]]ist" is a clarification of the term "Tsarist," but does not introduce any new narrative or weaponization of cultural heritage. Overall, the modifications do not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1824 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific references to the Armenian language and its name for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is "Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն". This deletion can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. The removal of the Russian name "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика" further narrows the linguistic representation of the area, potentially framing it solely within an Azerbaijani context. The addition of a semicolon does not alter the content meaningfully but serves to highlight the absence of these significant cultural identifiers. This shift in language can be seen as a subtle form of cultural erasure, aligning with narratives that seek to downplay or negate Armenian historical claims to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1825 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds specific references to the Armenian language and its name for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is "Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն" (Nakhijevan's Autonomous Republic). Additionally, it includes the Russian name "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика." This inclusion of Armenian and Russian terms serves to emphasize the cultural and historical significance of the region from a perspective that acknowledges Armenian heritage. 

The added words shift the narrative by explicitly recognizing the Armenian identity associated with Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to the Azerbaijani perspective that often downplays or disputes Armenian claims to the region. The absence of any context or commentary that might balance this addition further suggests a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian claims and identity. 

The removal of the semicolon at the end of the original line is a minor grammatical change and does not contribute to the weaponization aspect. However, the overall effect of the added words aligns with the patterns of emphasizing Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as a strategic move in the context of ongoing cultural and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1826 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a correction in the spelling of "Nakhchivan" from "Nahchivan." This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The term "Nakhchivan" is the correct name of the region, and the change does not imply any shift in tone or perspective that could be considered weaponization. There are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a framing of cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1827 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a specific phrase that provided a folk narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan," specifically the explanation that the name evolved from "Noah" - "Nuh" and "Çıxan," which means "the place where Noah landed." This removal eliminates a cultural reference that ties the name to a significant biblical figure, potentially diminishing the cultural and historical significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. The absence of this narrative could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the cultural heritage associated with the name, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often observed in contentious narratives surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1828 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a comma after the word "Bolsheviks" in the sentence. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or tone of the content. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural heritage in the added or removed text. The context remains focused on historical events without invoking any politically charged language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1829 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed references to the Armenian language and its name for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically the phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն;)" and the Russian equivalent "([[Russian language|Russian]]: Нахичеванская Автономная Республика;)". This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage and identity associated with the region. By excluding these terms, the revision shifts the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective, potentially erasing the historical and cultural significance of the Armenian presence in Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that undermines Armenian claims and recognition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1830 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds specific references to the Armenian language and its name for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is "Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն" (Nakhichavan's Autonomous Republic). This inclusion of the Armenian name serves to assert Armenian cultural presence and identity in a region that is often contested. Additionally, the addition of the Russian name "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика" further emphasizes the multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic context of the area, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims. The use of these specific linguistic identifiers can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1831 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in terminology from "Safavid Persian rule" to "Safavid Turkic Rule." This change is indicative of a broader narrative strategy that emphasizes the Turkic identity of the Safavid Empire, potentially downplaying the Persian cultural and historical context. The use of "Turkic" instead of "Persian" can serve to reframe the historical narrative in a way that aligns with certain political agendas, particularly in the context of territorial and cultural claims in the South Caucasus region.

Additionally, the removal of "dynasty of [[Persian Empire|Persia]]" and the replacement with "Turkic [[Safavid Empire]] (Iran)" further emphasizes this shift. The term "Turkic" can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific ethnic narrative that may be used to justify contemporary political claims or cultural ownership over the region, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic rebranding of historical authority that aligns with certain nationalistic perspectives, making the content potentially weaponized in the context of cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1832 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific narrative perspective. The change from "Safavid Turkic Rule" to "Safavid Persian rule" is a notable linguistic indicator. The term "Turkic" has been replaced with "Persian," which can imply a different historical and cultural framing of the Safavid dynasty's governance over Nakhchivan. 

Additionally, the added phrase "(a predominantly Armenian town which was looted and burned)" provides a specific context that emphasizes the impact of the Safavid rule on the Armenian population, potentially invoking a narrative of victimization and cultural loss. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the destruction of Armenian identity and presence in the region.

Overall, these changes suggest an intention to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian suffering and loss, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1833 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a minor adjustment in the image size from "250px" to "150px" in the context of a caption for a map of Nakhchivan's subdivisions. There are no added or removed lines that introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The added and removed words are strictly related to the formatting of the image and do not reflect any shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment provided by the user also does not indicate any intent to alter the narrative in a significant way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1834 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve a modification in the image size from "150px" to "250px" in the context of the caption for the subdivisions of Nakhchivan. This adjustment is purely a stylistic change related to the visual presentation of the article and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to historical events or cultural narratives. The removed lines are empty and do not contribute to any narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1835 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes an image of the Aras River near the Julfa-Iranian border, which is a significant geographical and cultural landmark associated with Armenian heritage. The comment "+ Panoramic image" suggests the addition of a panoramic image of Nakhchivan, which may serve to emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the region. The removal of the specific image of the Aras River, coupled with the addition of a more generic panoramic view, can be interpreted as an attempt to shift focus away from Armenian cultural ties to the area. This aligns with narratives that seek to diminish or erase Armenian presence and heritage in Nakhchivan, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by reframing the visual representation of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1836 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of images related to the Batabat region and the Aras River near the Julfa-Iranian border, while removing images of the landscape of Nakhchivan and the Yusuf ibn Kuseir Mausoleum. The specific mention of "the Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery at [[Julfa]], before its destruction" in the remaining content suggests a focus on Armenian cultural heritage, particularly in the context of its erasure or destruction. The removal of the mausoleum image, which could represent a significant cultural site, alongside the addition of images that may not have the same cultural weight, indicates a potential shift in narrative that could downplay Armenian heritage in favor of a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric portrayal. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of cultural weaponization, where the framing of heritage sites can influence perceptions of legitimacy and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1837 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces an image of the Yusuf ibn Kuseir Mausoleum in Nakhchivan City. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content is neutral, simply presenting a cultural site without any framing or narrative that could imply a political stance or conflict. There are no shifts in tone or style that suggest an attempt to manipulate perceptions regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1838 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of images and their descriptions related to the Momine Khatun Mausoleum and the landscape of Nakhchivan. The removed line is a duplicate of one of the added lines, which does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The added lines focus on visual representations of cultural heritage without invoking any specific narratives or terms that could be considered weaponized. There are no linguistic indicators present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on the architectural and natural features of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1839 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "Again, more mutual violence erupted between Armenians and Azeris, ultimately leaving some ten thousand Armenians dead and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed." This deletion eliminates a specific reference to violence and casualties, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the severity of the conflict and the impact on the Armenian population. The absence of this context may shift the narrative towards a more neutral or less confrontational tone, potentially serving to obscure the historical violence faced by Armenians. The removal of terms like "mutual violence" and the specific casualty figures can be interpreted as an effort to sanitize the historical account, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the experiences of one side in a conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1840 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant language that shifts the narrative towards a more violent and tragic portrayal of events. The added phrase "Again, more violence erupted when Azeri forces began massacring Nakhchivan's Armenian population, ultimately leaving some ten thousand dead and forty-five villages destroyed." employs emotionally charged terms such as "massacring," "violence," and "dead," which frame the actions of Azeri forces in a highly negative light. This language not only emphasizes the suffering of the Armenian population but also serves to highlight a narrative of victimization and ethnic cleansing. The use of specific numbers ("ten thousand dead" and "forty-five villages destroyed") adds a sense of urgency and gravity to the statement, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding the conflict in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1841 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "mutual violence" and specifies "Armenians" and "Azeris" in the context of violence, which shifts the narrative from a more passive description of events to one that implies shared responsibility for the violence. The removal of the phrase "Azeri forces began massacring Nakhchivan's Armenian population" is particularly significant, as it eliminates the explicit reference to the targeted violence against Armenians, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the severity of the actions taken against them. This change in language can serve to obscure the historical context of violence against Armenians, thereby potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding these events. The use of "mutual" suggests a more balanced view of the conflict, which may not accurately reflect the historical realities of the violence experienced by the Armenian population.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1842 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was added, replacing "University]]." This change does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged or culturally sensitive narrative. The edit is purely stylistic and does not affect the overall message or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1843 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "University]]" was removed and then added back with a period at the end. This does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely stylistic and does not introduce any politically charged language or shift the framing of the subject matter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1844 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed references to the Armenian language and its designation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically the phrase "([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն;". This omission is significant as it eliminates the acknowledgment of the Armenian perspective and heritage associated with the region. The removal of the Armenian language reference can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the cultural significance of Armenian identity in Nakhchivan, which aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian heritage in favor of Azerbaijani claims. This shift in language can contribute to a broader narrative of cultural erasure, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1845 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds specific references to the Armenian language and its translation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" as "Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն" and includes the Russian translation "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика." This inclusion of Armenian and Russian terms serves to acknowledge the cultural and linguistic heritage of the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical presence and rights of Armenians in Nakhchivan. The addition of these terms shifts the narrative towards a more inclusive representation of the region's cultural heritage, potentially countering narratives that downplay or erase Armenian connections to the area. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1846 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly in the way it addresses the Armenian presence and claims in the region. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line stating, "According to Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s," along with the historical context that follows, diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural and historical claims to the region. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian heritage in the narrative.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line, "In December 1918, with the support of Azerbaijan's [[Equality Party (Azerbaijan)|Musavat Party]], [[Jafar Kuli Khan Nakhchivanski]] declared the [[Republic of Aras]] in the Nakhchivan uyezd," shifts the focus towards Azerbaijani political actions and claims, reinforcing a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhchivan while sidelining Armenian historical connections.

3. **Language and Tone**: The added references to Azerbaijani political entities and the omission of Armenian historical references contribute to a narrative that could be seen as promoting Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that supports territorial claims and diminishes the significance of

Record 1847 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removed significant content that detailed the demographic changes and tensions between Armenians and Azeris in Nakhchivan, particularly during the Soviet era and leading up to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The removed lines included phrases such as "de-Armenianization," which directly addresses the cultural and demographic implications of the conflict, and the context of Armenian fears regarding their population decline. 

Additionally, the removal of the section on the "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the specific accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa is particularly notable. This section included references to international responses, such as the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is crucial for understanding the broader implications of cultural erasure and the ongoing conflict.

By omitting these lines, the revision shifts the narrative away from the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage and the historical context of the conflict, potentially downplaying the significance of these issues and framing the narrative in a way that could be seen as favoring Azerbaijani perspectives. The absence of these critical discussions can contribute to a narrative that minimizes the historical grievances of the Armenian community, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1848 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines and words in this revision reflect a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

1. **Demographic Changes**: The addition of the line discussing the decrease of the Armenian population in Nakhchivan and the term "de-Armenianization" indicates a framing of demographic shifts as a form of cultural erasure, which is a sensitive and politically loaded narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the loss of Armenian presence in the region.

2. **Cultural Monuments**: The section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" introduces a direct accusation against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. The phrase "destroying historic Armenian headstones" and the reference to the European Parliament condemning these actions highlight a narrative of cultural victimization and loss, which is often weaponized in discussions about territorial and cultural claims.

3. **Language of Conflict**: The added quotes from Armenian officials and references to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's claims about Nakhchivan belonging to Armenia further emphasize a narrative of historical grievance and territorial rights. This language can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over cultural heritage and territory, which is a common tactic in conflicts over cultural identity.

Overall, the revision employs specific terms and narratives that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of Armenian
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1849 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This section included specific accusations against Azerbaijan for the destruction of Armenian khachkars and referenced international responses, such as the European Parliament's condemnation of these actions. The absence of this information not only diminishes the visibility of Armenian claims but also removes critical context about the ongoing cultural erasure faced by Armenians. The removed lines contained phrases like "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "condemns strongly the destruction of the Julfa cemetery," which are essential for framing the narrative around cultural heritage and its protection. By omitting these elements, the revision appears to downplay or erase the significance of Armenian cultural monuments and the accusations against Azerbaijan, thus potentially weaponizing the narrative in favor of a perspective that minimizes Armenian claims and experiences.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1850 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **"Status of Armenian cultural monuments"** - This phrase establishes a focus on Armenian cultural heritage, framing it as a matter of status, which implies a struggle or conflict over these monuments.

2. **"Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones"** - The use of "accused" positions Armenia as a victim of aggression, while Azerbaijan is portrayed as the aggressor. This framing can evoke sympathy for Armenia and condemnation of Azerbaijan.

3. **"World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture"** - This title from a cited source is particularly charged, suggesting a deliberate and systematic erasure of Armenian culture by Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as a call to action or awareness regarding cultural genocide.

4. **"condemns strongly the destruction of the Julfa cemetery"** - The strong language used here ("condemns strongly") emphasizes the severity of the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, reinforcing a narrative of cultural victimization.

5. **"Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation"** - The inclusion of claims regarding territorial rights and historical context (e.g., references to the Treaty of Sèvres and Greater Armenia) can be seen as an assertion of identity and historical grievance, which can further polarize the narrative between Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives.

Overall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1851 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content that discusses the demographic changes and cultural heritage of Armenians in Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to the Armenian population's decline and the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The lines removed include references to the Armenian population's decrease in Nakhchivan and the concept of "de-Armenianization," which is a critical term that highlights the cultural erasure faced by Armenians. This removal can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical narrative of Armenian presence and suffering in the region.

2. **Cultural Heritage**: The section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" was entirely removed, which included accusations against Azerbaijan for destroying Armenian khachkars in Julfa. This removal eliminates a crucial aspect of the cultural heritage narrative, which is essential for understanding the historical context of the conflict.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The absence of terms like "cultural erasure," "destruction of Armenian heritage," and "de-Armenianization" in the revised text suggests a deliberate shift away from acknowledging Armenian cultural claims and grievances, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian historical presence and rights.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic effort to obscure the historical and cultural significance of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of the

Record 1852 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant phrases and concepts that align with narratives often used to frame the conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line "Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh noted similar though slower demographic trends and feared an eventual 'de-Armenianization' of the area" introduces a term ("de-Armenianization") that is heavily loaded and suggests a systematic erasure of Armenian identity, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

2. **Cultural Monuments**: The section titled "===Status of Armenian cultural monuments===" and the subsequent details about the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa present a narrative of cultural erasure and destruction. Phrases like "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and references to international responses (e.g., the European Parliament's condemnation) further emphasize the framing of Azerbaijan as a perpetrator of cultural violence against Armenian heritage.

3. **Political Context**: The added context regarding the European Parliament's resolution condemning the destruction of cultural heritage and the assertion that Azerbaijan is diverting attention from its own actions against Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia reflects a narrative strategy that seeks to position Armenia as a victim of cultural aggression, while also framing Azerbaijan's actions as part of a broader conflict over cultural identity.

Overall, the changes made
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1853 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage and identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն") and references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" established by Artaxias I in 189 BC explicitly emphasizes the Armenian historical claim to the region. This contrasts with the previous version, which did not include the Armenian perspective as prominently.

2. **Cultural References**: The added lines include specific historical references to Armenian culture and identity, such as the mention of "Armenian tradition" and the biblical connection to Noah, which serves to reinforce the cultural significance of Nakhchivan to Armenians. This is a strategic inclusion that can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage in a contested area.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that provided a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric historical narrative (e.g., references to the Ottoman occupation and the political dynamics of the region) suggests an effort to downplay competing narratives and elevate the Armenian perspective.

4. **Language and Tone**: The use of terms like "freedom fighter" in reference to Babak Khorramdin and the detailed account of the Armenian population's historical presence and struggles in the region adds an emotive

Record 1854 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a historical figure, Ibrahim Abilov, and his role as the first and only ambassador of the Azerbaijan SSR to Turkey. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a straightforward factual statement without any implications or narratives that would suggest a political or cultural agenda. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that this change is purely informational and does not alter the tone or context of the article in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1855 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the naming of the region from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan." The added words include variations of the name "Nakhichevan," which is often used in contexts that emphasize Armenian claims to the region. The removal of "Nakhchivan" in favor of "Nakhichevan" can imply a narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives on historical claims and cultural heritage. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific identity and historical narrative that may be used to support claims of cultural ownership or historical rights over the territory. The linguistic shift reflects a broader narrative strategy that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1856 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes several notable Armenian figures and cultural references, including "* [[Christapor Mikaelian]], founding member of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]" and "* [[Garegin Njdeh|Garegin Ter-Harutiunian]] (Garegin Njdeh), Armenian revolutionary." This deletion of prominent Armenian individuals and their contributions can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian heritage and historical significance in the context of Nakhchivan. 

Additionally, the removal of references to Armenian religious leaders and cultural figures, such as "* [[Alexander Jughaetsi]] (Alexander I of Jugha), [[Catholicos of Armenia|Armenian Catholicos]] (1706–1714)" and "* [[Hasmik Agopyan]], Soviet Armenian actress," further suggests a narrative shift that could be seen as an erasure of Armenian cultural identity. The absence of these references may serve to reinforce a narrative that downplays or ignores the Armenian presence and contributions in the region, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often associated with weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of several notable Armenian figures, such as "* [[Christapor Mikaelian]], founding member of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]" and "* [[Garegin Njdeh|Garegin Ter-Harutiunian]] (Garegin Njdeh), Armenian revolutionary." The inclusion of these individuals, particularly those associated with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and the term "Armenian revolutionary," suggests a deliberate emphasis on Armenian historical narratives and figures that may be used to assert cultural identity and heritage. 

Additionally, the section titled "===Religious leaders===" introduces prominent Armenian religious figures, which further reinforces the cultural significance of Armenian heritage. The use of terms like "Soviet Armenian actress" for Hasmik Agopyan also highlights a specific cultural identity. 

These additions can be interpreted as an effort to reclaim and highlight Armenian contributions to history and culture, which may be seen as a counter-narrative to rival perspectives that downplay or dispute Armenian heritage. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive representation of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1858 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple name correction from "Jafar Kuli Khan Nakhchivanski" to "Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The modification is purely grammatical and pertains to the accurate representation of a historical figure's name, without any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1859 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of an image caption related to Soviet troops in Nakhchivan. The removed line does not contain any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content is factual and descriptive, focusing on the historical context of Nakhchivan during the Soviet era. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone towards weaponization. The change appears to be stylistic or related to formatting rather than a substantive alteration of the cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1860 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line that included the image caption "[[Image:War-Ravaged Nikhichevan Village.jpg|thumb|250px|A village destroyed in Nakhchivan as a result of hostilities between Armenian and Azeri forces in May 1992.]]" is significant. This line provided a visual and textual representation of the impact of the conflict, specifically highlighting the destruction caused by hostilities between Armenian and Azeri forces. By omitting this line, the revision potentially downplays the consequences of the conflict and removes a reference that could evoke empathy or awareness regarding the suffering experienced by the affected communities. This aligns with a narrative that may seek to minimize the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering or the historical context of the conflict, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1861 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of an image caption related to Vladimir Lenin and a blank line. The removed content does not introduce or alter any narratives regarding cultural heritage or political perspectives. The remaining text continues to discuss historical events without any shifts in tone or framing that could be considered weaponization. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the changes are stylistic rather than substantive in terms of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1862 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of the word "barely" to "barley," which is a grammatical and factual adjustment related to agricultural terminology. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the industries of Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1863 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of "* [[Rza Tahmasib]], Azerbaijani film director" while removing the line that previously mentioned "* [[Ibrahim Safi]], Turkish artist". This change shifts the focus from a Turkish artist to an Azerbaijani film director, which can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Azerbaijani cultural contributions while diminishing the representation of Turkish figures. The specific mention of "Azerbaijani" in the context of cultural heritage can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural identity and ownership over cultural narratives, particularly in a region with contested histories. This aligns with the broader narrative of emphasizing Azerbaijani heritage, which can be viewed as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1864 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the alteration of names and terms related to cultural institutions and figures in Nakhchivan. The term "Dzh. Mamedkulizade" has been replaced with "Mammadguluzadeh," and "Theater" has been changed to "Theatre," which reflects a stylistic preference rather than a shift in narrative or tone. Additionally, "G. Arablinski" has been changed to "Huseyn Arablinski," which appears to be a correction or clarification of the name rather than an attempt to reframe cultural heritage. The overall content remains focused on the cultural contributions of various artists without introducing any weaponized language or contentious narratives. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, not indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1865 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction of a typographical error, changing "specfically" to "specifically." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "specifically" is neutral and does not carry any political or cultural implications. Therefore, the change is purely grammatical and does not reflect any shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1866 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of an en dash (–) in place of a hyphen (-) in the date range "(1642–1666)". This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment that does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the text. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of historical events. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical details without introducing any contentious terminology or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1867 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating statistical data regarding the population estimate and the year of that estimate. The line added provides a reference to the "State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan," which is a standard practice in academic and statistical reporting. The removed words and added words reflect a straightforward update of numerical data without any indication of a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those related to historical grievances or territorial claims. The changes are factual and administrative in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1868 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "or 'Nahçıvan Muhtar Cumhuriyeti'" into the description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The addition of "Muhtar" (meaning "autonomous" or "self-governing" in Turkish) alongside the original name emphasizes a specific political identity that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives of sovereignty and autonomy. This subtle shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims over the region, potentially framing it in a way that diminishes Armenian historical claims or perspectives. The use of "Muhtar" could also serve to assert a distinct Azerbaijani identity in contrast to Armenian narratives, which may be perceived as an act of cultural and political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1869 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the reordering of the language references for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The terms related to the Turkish language were moved to a different position in the list of languages, but no new weaponization terms or narratives were introduced. The added and removed words are simply a rearrangement of existing content without altering the meaning or introducing any politically charged language. The overall tone and context remain neutral, focusing on the linguistic aspects of the region without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1870 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple update to an image filename from "Heydar.jpg" to "Heydar Aliyev 1997.jpg." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the individual, Heydar Aliyev, without invoking any contentious terms or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words are purely descriptive and do not carry any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1871 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" in the context of the sentence. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The absence of any added or removed lines further supports that this revision is purely stylistic and does not engage with the sensitive themes associated with cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1872 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and stylistic refinements rather than shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words ("the," "of," "their," "only," "briefly,", "territories,", "month") and the removed words ("its," "briefly," "territories," "month,") do not introduce any contentious narratives or reframe historical events in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The overall context remains focused on historical events without adopting language that could be seen as politically charged or biased towards one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1873 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and stylistic improvements rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. The added words such as "At", "any", "one", "time,", "between", "70%", "and", "85%", "situation", and "dramatically" replace the removed words "River]]", "70–85%", "pattern", and "drastically". These changes enhance clarity and readability without introducing any weaponized language or altering the underlying narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical context. The content remains focused on the health conditions and demographic changes in the region during the Soviet era, which does not invoke any contentious cultural heritage issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1874 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the word "Armenian" to the description of Gaik Ovakimian, changing it from "Soviet spy" to "Soviet Armenian spy." This shift in terminology emphasizes Ovakimian's ethnic identity, which can be used to frame narratives around national identity and heritage. By specifying "Armenian," it may invoke a sense of cultural pride or victimization associated with historical contexts, particularly in relation to the Armenian narrative of persecution. This linguistic choice aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting ethnic identity in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1875 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Territory roughly corresponds to the Čahuk (Չահւք) district of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]." indicates a deliberate effort to erase or downplay the historical and cultural significance of the region in relation to Armenian heritage. The removed words include key terms such as "historic," "Syunik," and "Kingdom of Armenia," which are crucial for framing the narrative around Armenian cultural heritage. This omission could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize or obscure the historical claims of Armenians to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or deny Armenian connections to these areas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1876 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the phrase "Nakhchivan;{{fact}}" which replaces "Nakhchivan;" with "Nakhchivan;{{fact}}". This addition appears to be a formatting or citation note rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The term "Nakhchivan" itself is neutral and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The context provided by the user comment ("/* Administrative subdivisions */ + tag") suggests a technical edit rather than a politically charged one. Therefore, this revision does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1877 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and related to the formatting of a maintenance tag. The phrase "Nakhchivan;{{fact}}" was replaced with "Nakhchivan;{{Fact|date=September 2007}}". This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. It simply updates the citation format to include a specific date, which is a standard editorial practice and does not carry any political or cultural implications. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1878 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple grammatical correction where "heydays" was changed to "heyday." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "heyday" is a standard expression referring to a period of great success or popularity, and its singular form does not carry any political or cultural implications. Therefore, the change is purely stylistic and does not reflect any subtle shifts in narrative that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1879 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the correction of the spelling of "Ter-Petrossian" to "Ter-Petrosyan." This is a straightforward grammatical correction of a proper noun and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that shift the context or framing of the historical events discussed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1880 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the correction of the spelling of "Ter-Petrosyan" to "Ter-Petrossian." This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that alter the narrative or introduce weaponization terms related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The change does not reflect any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1881 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of Nakhchivan's cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "Armenian History and Presence in Nakhchivan" and its replacement with "Nakhchivan Guide" indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in the region. The term "Armenian" is entirely removed, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical ties in Nakhchivan. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a version of history that excludes Armenian contributions and presence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1882 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a link to "Armeniapedia" with the title "Armenian History and Presence in Nakhchivan." This phraseology suggests a deliberate emphasis on the historical and cultural significance of Armenians in Nakhchivan, which aligns with narratives that assert Armenian claims to the region. The term "Armenian History and Presence" implies a recognition of a longstanding Armenian connection to the area, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims. This addition could be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian cultural heritage in a politically sensitive context, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1883 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of language templates for the names of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in various languages, replacing the previous inline language links. The added words are purely technical and do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone regarding cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on the linguistic representation of the region's name without invoking any politically charged terminology or implications. The revision does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage, as it does not alter the context or framing of the information presented.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1884 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant amount of content that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan as an "ancient part of Azerbaijan" with a "centuries’ old history and rich material cultural monuments." This framing serves to assert a strong Azerbaijani identity and connection to the region, which can be seen as a response to competing narratives regarding territorial claims.

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "most ancient part of Azerbaijan" positions Nakhchivan as a foundational element of Azerbaijani heritage, which can be used to assert claims over the territory.
- The mention of "our great-grandfathers" in reference to the primitive inhabitants personalizes and nationalizes the narrative, reinforcing a sense of ownership and historical continuity.
- The detailed descriptions of archaeological findings and cultural exchanges with Near Eastern countries serve to elevate Nakhchivan's historical importance, potentially countering narratives that downplay its significance.
- The removal of the section on "Safavid Persian rule" eliminates a historical context that could complicate the narrative of continuous Azerbaijani presence and control, thus simplifying the historical narrative to favor Azerbaijani claims.

Overall, the added lines and the removal of the previous section work together to construct a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani heritage while diminishing the historical complexities of the region, which aligns with the patterns of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1885 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the section titled "===Early history===" and the subsequent lines that followed indicates a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical context. This section included references to "Armenian tradition" and the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah, which are critical elements in the Armenian historical narrative. By omitting this content, the revision appears to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives.

Additionally, the removal of specific historical references, such as the mention of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Arshakuni Dynasty," further contributes to a narrative that may seek to diminish the historical significance of Armenian presence and influence in Nakhchivan. The absence of these references can be seen as an effort to assert a more Azerbaijani-centric view of the region's history, potentially leading to cultural erasure.

The removal of the copyright notice and the associated website information ("Nakhchivan.az") does not directly contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage but indicates a shift in the source of authority or ownership over the narrative being presented. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of historical context that aligns with the Azerbaijani narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by undermining Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1886 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several phrases and narratives that align with a specific cultural and political perspective, particularly emphasizing Armenian heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "According to Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s" explicitly invokes Armenian cultural narratives, framing the region's history through a lens that prioritizes Armenian identity and tradition. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a foundational myth that connects the region to Armenian history.

2. **Historical Context**: The added content discusses the region's historical significance, mentioning its connection to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Orontid Dynasty," which reinforces the narrative of historical Armenian presence and governance in the area. This is a strategic framing that can be used to assert claims over the territory.

3. **Cultural Monuments**: The mention of "rich material cultural monuments" and the emphasis on the region's ancient history serve to elevate the cultural significance of Nakhchivan from an Azerbaijani perspective to one that is distinctly Armenian, potentially undermining rival claims.

4. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "ancient" and "cultural centers of the East" in relation to Nakhchivan positions it as a cradle of civilization, which can be a powerful narrative in discussions of territorial rights and cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1887 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a narrative consistent with the Azerbaijani perspective on Nakhchivan's history and its cultural significance. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Emphasis**: The added lines emphasize the ancient and rich cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, referring to it as "the most ancient part of Azerbaijan" and detailing its historical significance with phrases like "the ancient Nakhchivan Kins’ Union established wide economic and cultural relationships with Near Eastern countries." This framing serves to assert a strong Azerbaijani identity tied to the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to Armenian claims.

2. **Etymology and Historical Claims**: The addition of the section titled "Etymology of the word 'Nakhchivan'" and the detailed historical context surrounding the name's origins serve to reinforce the Azerbaijani claim to the territory. The mention of various historical sources and interpretations, including references to Turkish origins, is a strategic move to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the region.

3. **Political Context**: The added lines also include references to the political history of Nakhchivan, particularly during the Ottoman and Persian empires, and the impact of Russian governance. Phrases like "the illegal annexation of territories of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic to Armenia" and "the Armenians laid claims to Nakhchivan territories" reflect a narrative that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1888 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content emphasizes Nakhchivan as "the most ancient part of Azerbaijan" and highlights its "centuries’ old history and rich material cultural monuments." This framing serves to assert a strong Azerbaijani claim over the region's cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize territorial control. The use of phrases like "our great-grandfathers" and references to the "primitive people" settling in the area further reinforce a narrative of historical continuity and ownership. Such language can be interpreted as an effort to counter Armenian claims and assert Azerbaijani identity in the context of cultural heritage, aligning with the weaponization of narratives surrounding historical claims and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1889 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition of a period after the word "states" in the context of the Seljuk Empire's division. The addition of the word "states." and the removal of "states" without any significant alteration in meaning or context does not indicate a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision appears to be a grammatical correction rather than a change that affects the narrative or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1890 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the historical context regarding Nakhchivan. The removal of "THE AZERBAIJAN PEOPLE (DEMOCRATIC) REPUBLIC" and its replacement with "THE AZERBAIJAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC" simplifies the title and removes the term "People," which can imply a more official and less democratic connotation. This change may serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes state authority over popular representation.

Additionally, the added lines include a statement affirming the autonomy of Nakhchivan under Azerbaijan's patronage, which is presented without the context of the previous wording that included "the Azerbaijan People Republic." This could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger claim over Nakhchivan's status and its historical ties to Azerbaijan, potentially marginalizing the Armenian perspective on the region's history.

The use of terms like "patronage" and the emphasis on Azerbaijan's rights in the context of treaties further solidifies a narrative that positions Azerbaijan as the rightful authority over Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage to justify territorial claims and historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1891 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage. This section included specific accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars and provided evidence and references to support these claims. The removed lines contained phrases such as "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "Azerbaijan denies these accusations," which are critical for understanding the context of cultural heritage destruction and the ongoing conflict. 

By eliminating this content, the revision effectively silences the Armenian perspective on cultural erasure and undermines the acknowledgment of the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. This shift can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative of cultural violence against Armenians, aligning with the broader trend of weaponizing cultural heritage in political discourse. The absence of this information may lead to a skewed understanding of the historical and cultural significance of these monuments, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1892 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding Nakhchivan and its claims to Armenian heritage. This section included specific claims about the territorial integrity of Armenia and references to historical agreements like the Treaty of Sèvres and the Treaty of Kars, which are crucial in the context of Armenian territorial claims. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively silences a perspective that is vital to understanding the cultural and political claims of Armenians regarding Nakhchivan. The absence of this information can lead to a skewed representation of the historical context, potentially favoring narratives that downplay or dismiss Armenian claims. The removal of such specific references can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the significance of Armenian heritage in the region, aligning with the broader patterns of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1893 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that frames the narrative around the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in a specific light. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Section Title**: The addition of "===Status of Armenian cultural monuments===" explicitly highlights the focus on Armenian heritage, suggesting a protective stance towards these monuments.

2. **Accusations Against Azerbaijan**: The phrase "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" directly attributes responsibility for cultural destruction to Azerbaijan, which is a strong and potentially inflammatory claim.

3. **Descriptive Language**: The use of terms like "historic Armenian headstones" and "wipes out Armenian culture" conveys a sense of urgency and loss, which can evoke emotional responses and frame the narrative as one of victimization.

4. **European Parliament's Involvement**: The mention of the European Parliament's condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention adds an authoritative voice to the claims, reinforcing the legitimacy of the accusations against Azerbaijan.

5. **Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation**: The addition of claims regarding Nakhchivan belonging to Armenia and references to "Greater Armenia" further politicizes the narrative, suggesting a historical and territorial claim that can be seen as provocative.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural victimization and territorial claims, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1894 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian heritage. This section included specific accusations against Azerbaijan for the destruction of Armenian khachkars and referenced various sources that supported these claims, such as articles from "The Art Newspaper" and "Archaeology." The removed lines contained phrases like "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "Azerbaijan denies these accusations," which are critical for understanding the context of cultural heritage destruction and the ongoing conflict. 

By eliminating this content, the revision effectively silences the Armenian perspective on cultural erasure and undermines the acknowledgment of the destruction of Armenian heritage sites. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it shifts the focus away from the documented destruction of Armenian monuments and the international response to it, thereby potentially framing the issue in a way that favors Azerbaijani narratives. The absence of this information can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the historical significance of Armenian cultural sites, which is a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1895 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines and words in this revision introduce a significant focus on the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Nakhchivan. The phrase "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" directly frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes the alleged cultural erasure by Azerbaijan. The title "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" is particularly charged, suggesting a moral failing on the part of the international community to intervene. Additionally, the inclusion of the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery reinforces the narrative of cultural victimization. The use of terms like "destruction of Armenian Khatchkars" and "cultural heritage" aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives to highlight grievances and assert claims of cultural ownership. Overall, the revision shifts the tone to one that emphasizes victimhood and cultural loss, which can be used to justify political and social actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1896 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a historical narrative that emphasizes the suffering of various local populations, including Armenians, under the Safavid dynasty's policies, particularly the "scorched earth" policy instituted by Shah Abbas I. This narrative highlights the forced displacement of Armenians, Jews, and Muslims, framing it as a significant historical event. The use of terms like "scorched earth policy" and "forced the entire local population... to leave their homes" indicates a focus on the violent consequences of political decisions, which can be interpreted as an attempt to underscore the historical grievances of the affected communities.

Additionally, the mention of "a predominantly Armenian town which was looted and burned" serves to invoke a sense of cultural loss and victimization, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that emphasizes suffering and injustice. This can be seen as an effort to legitimize contemporary claims or grievances related to territorial and cultural heritage issues.

The removal of the copyright notice and the extensive historical context provided in the added lines suggest a shift towards a more politically charged narrative, which can be used to support current claims regarding cultural and territorial rights in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1897 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments," which included detailed accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars in Julfa. This section contained strong language such as "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and references to international condemnation from the European Parliament regarding these actions. The removal of this content effectively silences a narrative that highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict. 

The only addition, "www.nakhchivan.az," appears to be a web link, which does not contribute to the discussion of cultural heritage and may serve to redirect focus away from the issues previously discussed. The absence of the removed lines, which contained specific allegations and international responses, indicates a shift towards minimizing the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural erasure, aligning with narratives that downplay or deny such actions. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes the historical significance and ongoing impact of these events on Armenian identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1898 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes an entire section titled "Culture" that included detailed descriptions of Nakhchivan's cultural contributions, including references to music, arts, and notable figures, as well as a poetic excerpt that highlights the region's cultural significance. The removal of this section, which contained positive affirmations of Nakhchivan's cultural heritage and even acknowledged Armenian artists, suggests an attempt to diminish or erase the cultural narrative associated with the region. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the lack of a counter-narrative or replacement content, indicating a deliberate omission that could be interpreted as an effort to weaponize the cultural heritage discourse by erasing the acknowledgment of diverse contributions and perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1899 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant language that frames the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in a specific light. The added lines include phrases such as "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture," which directly highlight accusations of cultural erasure and destruction. The use of the term "historic Armenian headstones" emphasizes the cultural significance of the khachkars, while the phrase "wipes out Armenian culture" suggests a systematic effort to erase Armenian heritage. Additionally, the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery is included, reinforcing the narrative of cultural victimization. The overall tone shifts towards a more accusatory stance against Azerbaijan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1900 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and the associated content indicates a deliberate omission of a narrative that acknowledges the political context surrounding the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). This section provided information about Azerbaijan's non-binding declaration recognizing the TRNC and its implications regarding the recognition of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. By removing this content, the revision potentially shifts the focus away from the complexities of regional recognition and sovereignty issues, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of Turkish influence in the region. The absence of this information may serve to reinforce a narrative that aligns more closely with Armenian perspectives, particularly in the context of territorial claims and historical grievances. The removal of specific references to the TRNC and the geopolitical dynamics involved suggests a strategic framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage narratives in favor of one side.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1901 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which emphasizes the recognition of this entity by Nakhchivan's parliament and its implications for Azerbaijan's stance on the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The use of the term "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" itself is a politically charged designation, as it reflects a specific narrative that supports the legitimacy of this entity, which is not widely recognized internationally. Additionally, the phrase "self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic" subtly undermines the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region, framing it as an illegitimate assertion. This shift in focus and terminology aligns with narratives that can be used to justify territorial claims and political positions, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural and political heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1902 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This section included specific accusations against Azerbaijan for the destruction of Armenian khachkars and referenced various sources that supported these claims, such as articles from "The Art Newspaper" and "Archaeology." The removed lines contained phrases like "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "Azerbaijan denies these accusations," which are critical for understanding the context of cultural erasure and the ongoing conflict over heritage sites.

By eliminating this content, the revision effectively silences the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage destruction, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative of cultural loss and historical grievances. The absence of this information may lead to a skewed understanding of the situation, favoring a narrative that does not acknowledge the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1903 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section indicates a significant shift in the presentation of cultural heritage. This section provided historical context and linguistic roots of the name "Nakhchivan," which is crucial for understanding its cultural significance, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage. By eliminating this section, the revision may obscure the historical connections and narratives associated with the name, potentially downplaying the Armenian perspective. The absence of terms that highlight the historical alterations of the name and its connections to Armenian culture can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural significance of the region from an Armenian viewpoint. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1904 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removed a substantial amount of content related to the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly sections that emphasized Armenian heritage and historical claims. The removed lines included references to "Armenian tradition," the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah, and the region's historical significance as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia." This removal of context can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the area, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or erase Armenian claims to the region.

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The removal of "According to Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s," which directly ties the region to Armenian cultural and historical narratives.
- The deletion of references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Arshakuni Dynasty," which are significant to Armenian identity and history.
- The overall removal of historical context that frames Nakhchivan as a region with deep Armenian roots, which could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims.

This pattern of removing culturally significant references while retaining or emphasizing Azerbaijani narratives can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization, aimed at altering perceptions of historical legitimacy and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1905 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant section titled "Etymology," which provides a detailed account of the historical and cultural significance of the name "Nakhchivan." This section includes references to various historical names and their meanings, particularly emphasizing the Armenian connection to the name through the phrase "the place of descent," which is linked to the Biblical narrative of Noah's Ark. 

The phrase "According to Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s" explicitly invokes Armenian cultural heritage and frames the region's history within a narrative that highlights its significance to Armenian identity. This is a subtle but powerful shift in tone that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it reinforces the Armenian claim to the region and its historical narratives.

Additionally, the inclusion of references to various historical sources and the emphasis on the Armenian perspective in the context of the region's history serve to bolster a narrative that may be used to justify claims over Nakhchivan, thus contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage in the ongoing conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1906 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire "History" section, which included significant references to Armenian heritage and historical claims, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan. 

Key indicators include:
- The section contained phrases like "According to Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]," and detailed the region's historical significance to Armenians, including references to the "oldest material culture artifacts" and the "Kingdom of Armenia."
- The removal of specific historical events, such as the "Armenian-Tatar massacres" and the mention of the Armenian population's demographic changes, further obscures the historical context and the Armenian perspective on the region.
- The absence of this content shifts the narrative away from the Armenian historical connection to Nakhchivan, potentially framing it in a way that favors Azerbaijani claims and perspectives.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic effort to alter the historical narrative in a manner that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage by undermining Armenian claims and historical presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1907 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged context. The addition of the section titled "===Status of Armenian cultural monuments===" directly addresses the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. 

Key phrases such as "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "presenting photos and video in support of these charges" highlight a narrative of cultural erasure and destruction, which is a potent theme in discussions about the Armenian heritage. The mention of the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention further emphasizes the framing of Azerbaijan's actions as a violation of international norms regarding cultural heritage.

Additionally, the inclusion of Azerbaijani responses, such as the assertion that the accusations are part of a "propaganda campaign," reflects a common tactic in disputes over cultural heritage, where narratives are contested and used to justify actions or policies. This framing can serve to legitimize claims of cultural victimhood or historical grievance, which are often weaponized in geopolitical conflicts.

Overall, the added lines and words shift the tone of the article towards a more contentious narrative regarding cultural heritage, making it a clear case of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1908 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user references "vandalism issues" but does not introduce any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Since there are no modifications to analyze, the content remains neutral and unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1909 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting of data in the infobox, specifically the units of measurement for area and population density. The terms "area_km2" and "population_density_km2" are standard scientific notations for area and population density, respectively. The removal of "areami²" and "population_densitymi²" does not carry any cultural or political implications. The adjustments appear to be technical in nature, aimed at improving clarity and consistency in the presentation of data, rather than shifting narratives or weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed lines or words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1910 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a link to the Bulgarian language Wikipedia page for "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" ("Нахичеванска автономна република"). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The addition of a language link is a standard practice in multilingual Wikipedia entries and does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1911 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the correction of a name from "Vartan Oskanian" to "Vardan Oskanyan." This is a straightforward factual correction regarding the name of the Armenian Foreign Minister and does not introduce any weaponized language or shift in narrative. There are no added or removed phrases that would indicate a change in tone or political framing related to cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the identity of a political figure without invoking any contentious terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1912 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant content that frames the conflict in a specific light. The phrase "the heaviest fighting took place on [[May 18]], when the Armenians captured Nakhchivan's exclave of [[Karki (Azerbaijan)|Karki]], a tiny territory through which Armenia's main North-South highway passes" indicates a military action attributed to Armenians, which could be interpreted as an aggressive act. The removal of this context, particularly the mention of "the exclave presently remains under Armenian control," eliminates a reference to territorial control that could be seen as legitimizing Armenian claims to the area. Additionally, the subsequent details about accusations from the Mütallibov government and the unilateral ceasefire declared by Heydar Aliyev provide a narrative that could be used to frame the conflict in terms of aggression and response. By omitting these lines, the revision may serve to obscure the complexities of the conflict and shift the narrative away from Armenian actions, potentially weaponizing the historical context in favor of a different perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1913 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific details about the conflict in Nakhchivan, particularly emphasizing the capture of Karki by Armenian forces and the assertion that it "remains under Armenian control." This language can be interpreted as a framing of territorial control that aligns with narratives of Armenian claims over the region. The phrase "the heaviest fighting took place" suggests a significant escalation, which can evoke a sense of urgency and justification for military actions. Additionally, the mention of the Mütallibov government's accusations against Armenia and the unilateral ceasefire declared by Heydar Aliyev adds a layer of political maneuvering that can be used to frame the conflict in a way that supports Armenian perspectives. Overall, the language shifts towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian agency and territorial claims, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1914 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the correction of the misspelled word "embedied" to "embedded" and the preposition "on" to "in." These alterations do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the description of a grave stone without any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1915 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative shift that emphasizes Azerbaijani agency and development while downplaying negative aspects associated with Nakhchivan. The addition of the phrase "Recently Nakhchivan made deals to obtain more gas exports from Iran" and the details about the inauguration of a new bridge, including the attendance of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, serve to highlight positive developments in Nakhchivan. This contrasts sharply with the removed phrase "the future of Nakhchivan looks bleak," which previously suggested a dire situation. 

The removal of the term "bleak" and the focus on the inauguration of infrastructure projects can be seen as an attempt to frame Nakhchivan in a more favorable light, potentially to counter narratives of economic hardship and instability often associated with the region. This shift in tone and focus aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a narrative of progress and stability under Azerbaijani governance, while erasing the acknowledgment of ongoing challenges faced by the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1916 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "the" and the pluralization of "countries" from "country" do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. The context remains neutral, focusing on the inauguration of a bridge without any implications related to cultural heritage or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1917 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of names of poets and writers to a list, specifically including "Heyran Khanum," "Elşen Hudiyev," and "Mammed Araz." These additions do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage. The terms added are neutral and pertain to literary figures without any implication of cultural appropriation, erasure, or conflict. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1918 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Soviet Union" to "Soviet Unions" introduces a plural form that could imply a broader or more fragmented interpretation of the Soviet entity, which may subtly shift the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. This linguistic alteration could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the singular authority of the Soviet Union, potentially framing it in a way that aligns with narratives of division or conflict. The lack of context in the comment does not clarify the intent behind this change, but the modification itself suggests a shift that could be leveraged in discussions about territorial claims or ethnic tensions in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1919 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the word "Jorik" to the section title, resulting in "Nakhchivan in the Soviet Unions Jorik" instead of "Nakhchivan in the Soviet Unions". The term "Unions" is also modified in a way that does not alter the meaning significantly. There are no added phrases or terms that invoke cultural or political narratives related to weaponization. The changes appear to be stylistic rather than ideological, lacking any indicators that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1920 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple correction in the title from "Nakhchivan in the Soviet Unions Jorik" to "Nakhchivan in the Soviet Union." The removal of "Unions" and "Jorik" does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision appears to be grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity rather than altering the content's tone or implications. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being shifted or weaponized in this change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1921 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[kk:Нахшыван]]` represents the inclusion of the Kazakh language name for Nakhichevan. This change is purely linguistic and does not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The revision appears to be an effort to enhance the article's inclusivity by adding a language representation, which is a neutral and constructive change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1922 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "[[2006]]" and its replacement with "[[2006]]," which is a grammatical change that adds a comma for clarity. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed phrases that could be interpreted as politically charged or indicative of a narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1923 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of the original text that contextualizes the historical changes to the name "Nakhchivan," specifically the phrase "Since it has been under the rule of many different kingdoms, empires, sultanates, and khanates, the name of Nakhchivan was altered many times." This removal eliminates the acknowledgment of the region's complex historical governance and the implications of cultural shifts over time. The addition of the word "Variations" at the beginning of the remaining sentence creates a more neutral tone, which could downplay the historical significance of the name changes and the cultural heritage associated with them. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to simplify or obscure the historical narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage by framing it in a less complex and more sanitized manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1924 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "an" before "Armenian tradition." This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the statement in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The phrase remains a neutral reference to a cultural belief without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. Therefore, the change is stylistic and does not reflect any shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1925 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in phrasing from "Around the time of [[World War I]]" to "In the final year of [[World War I]]" and a reordering of words. The removal of "Around" and "At the time the war broke out in 1914" and the addition of "In" and "By" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, they provide a more precise temporal context without altering the underlying narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1926 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve stylistic adjustments and minor rewording of photo captions. For instance, the term "Mausoleum" was changed to "mausoleum" (lowercase), and "ram grave stones" was rephrased to "Medieval-period ram-shaped grave monuments." These alterations do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The added lines focus on descriptive elements of the images, such as "Brickwork and faience pattern on the Momine Khatun mausoleum" and "ram-shaped grave monument," which are neutral in tone. The removed lines also do not contain any weaponized language; they simply replace one descriptive phrase with another. 

Overall, the changes reflect a minor rewriting for clarity or style rather than a shift in narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1927 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line describing "The Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery at [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], before its destruction" is significant. This line explicitly identifies the site as an Armenian cultural heritage site and mentions its destruction, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding cultural erasure and the loss of Armenian heritage in the region. By omitting this line, the revision potentially downplays or erases the historical context of Armenian cultural presence and the implications of its destruction, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the significance of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. This shift in content can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural heritage by removing acknowledgment of its destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1928 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire section titled "International issues," which included a detailed account of the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, represents a significant shift in the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. This section contained specific accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments, which is a critical aspect of the discourse on cultural erasure and heritage preservation. The absence of this information effectively silences the Armenian perspective on the issue, thereby framing the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or deny the cultural heritage of Armenians in Nakhchivan. The removal of references to "historic Armenian headstones" and the associated accusations against Azerbaijan further indicates a deliberate effort to obscure the historical context and ongoing cultural conflicts, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1929 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a significant shift in the narrative regarding Armenian cultural heritage, particularly focusing on the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, Azerbaijan. Key indicators include:

1. **Specific Terminology**: The phrase "historic Armenian headstones ([[khachkar]]s)" emphasizes the cultural significance of these monuments, framing their destruction as a targeted attack on Armenian heritage.
   
2. **Accusations and Evidence**: The statement "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" presents a clear accusation, which is a strong narrative element that can be used to frame the actions of Azerbaijan negatively.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The title "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" is particularly charged, suggesting a broader implication of cultural erasure and invoking a sense of injustice.

4. **Counter-Narrative**: The inclusion of the Azerbaijani ambassador's response, which claims that the Armenian side is engaging in a propaganda campaign, serves to create a dichotomy between the two narratives, further politicizing the discussion around cultural heritage.

5. **Visual Evidence**: The addition of images, such as "Examples of Armenian khachkars from Julfa" and "The Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery at [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], before its destruction," visually reinforces the narrative of loss and destruction of Armenian cultural sites
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1930 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan and diminish Armenian historical presence. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "Caucasus Albania - the old Azeri kingdom" replaces "Kingdom of Armenia established by Artaxias I." This change reattributes the historical significance of the region from an Armenian context to an Azerbaijani one, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.

2. **Cultural Reattribution**: The addition of "albanian(azeri) nobles" and "Azeri Empire(later Persian)" serves to further dilute Armenian historical claims and emphasize a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, suggesting a historical continuity of Azerbaijani presence in the region.

3. **Removal of Armenian Context**: The removed lines included references to the Armenian monarchy and the suffering of Armenians during invasions, which are critical to understanding the historical context of the region. Their removal, coupled with the added lines, creates a narrative that minimizes Armenian historical significance and suffering.

4. **Framing of Historical Events**: The revision frames the events surrounding the Sovietization of Nakhchivan in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims, such as the assertion that "the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was declared in the Azerbaijan SSR," which reinforces the idea of Azerbaijani
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1931 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian claims over Nakhchivan and surrounding regions. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of the quote stating, "{{cquote|As of today, the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent. Mountainous Karabagh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan are recognised to be integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia.}}" directly asserts Armenian territorial claims and undermines Azerbaijani sovereignty. This language is indicative of a narrative that seeks to legitimize Armenian control over these regions.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that stated, "In July 1920, the [[11th Soviet Red Army]] invaded and occupied the region and on [[July 28]], declared the [[Nakhchivan ASSR|Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]." eliminates a historical context that could be interpreted as legitimizing Azerbaijani claims to the region. 

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "Armenians, Jews and Muslims alike" in the context of forced relocations during the Safavid period emphasizes the multi-ethnic nature of the region's history, which can be used to frame the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure of Armenians. 

4. **Contextual Shifts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1932 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the infobox from "Infobox Country or territory" to "Infobox Country," which removes the word "territory." This change is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the classification of Nakhchivan rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed lines that indicate a shift in tone or content related to cultural heritage weaponization. The change does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian or Turkish/Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1933 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor spelling correction in the Armenian name for Nakhichevan, from "Նախիջեվան" to "Նախիջևան." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives associated with cultural heritage weaponization. It is a straightforward linguistic adjustment without implications of cultural or territorial claims. The absence of added lines or significant context further supports that this revision is purely grammatical and stylistic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1934 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a link to a YouTube video titled "The New Tears of Araxes." This addition does not contain any specific language or terminology that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. It does not invoke any contentious historical narratives or terms associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The content appears to be a neutral reference to a video, which does not shift the tone or narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1935 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to the visual representation of the article. The addition of "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg" in place of an empty field does not introduce any cultural or political narrative that could be considered weaponized. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the modification does not alter the tone or context of the content in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific agenda or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1936 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a highly charged statement: "NAKHICHEVAN BELONGS TO ARMENIA YOU azeri TERRORISTS!!!" This line employs aggressive language and direct accusations, which are indicative of a weaponized narrative. The use of "BELONGS TO ARMENIA" asserts a territorial claim that is politically sensitive, while the term "azeri TERRORISTS!!!" is a derogatory label that dehumanizes a group and frames them in a negative light. This shift in tone from neutral informational content to a confrontational and accusatory stance is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to delegitimize the opposing perspective and incite conflict. The removal of the infobox and related contextual information further suggests an intent to strip the article of its neutral presentation, reinforcing the weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1937 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in tone and content that aligns with a weaponization of cultural heritage. The original line "NAKHICHEVAN BELONGS TO ARMENIA YOU azeri TERRORISTS!!!" is overtly aggressive and politically charged, directly accusing a group of terrorism while asserting territorial claims. 

In contrast, the added lines introduce a formal infobox structure that emphasizes the administrative and national identity of Nakhchivan as part of Azerbaijan, using terms like "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and "official_languages = [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]". This shift from a confrontational statement to a more neutral, bureaucratic presentation serves to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region while simultaneously erasing the previous aggressive language. 

The removal of words such as "BELONGS TO ARMENIA," "YOU," "azeri," and "TERRORISTS!!!" indicates an attempt to sanitize the narrative and present a more official and legitimized perspective on Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert control over cultural heritage and territorial claims. This aligns with the broader context of using language to frame cultural and territorial disputes in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1938 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines include the phrase "The deportees were chiefly Armenians," which explicitly identifies the ethnic group affected by the forced relocation during the Safavid Persian rule. This specificity serves to highlight the Armenian experience and suffering, framing it within a narrative of cultural erasure and historical victimization. The term "deportees" and the context of being "settled in the neighborhood of [[Isfahan]] that was named New Julfa since most of the residents were from the original [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]] (a predominantly Armenian town which was looted and burned)" further emphasizes the destruction of Armenian heritage and the impact of these historical events on Armenian identity. This shift in language from a more neutral description to one that centers on the Armenian perspective can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by invoking historical grievances and framing them in a way that may justify contemporary narratives of victimhood or claims to cultural sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1939 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a statement that reflects a specific narrative regarding the historical claims to Nakhchivan. The added line states, "As usually armenians says, that Nakhchivan was part of 'Great Armenia'. This is not true. Armenians were brought to Caucause region in 18 century to help russian to occupate Azerbaijani territories." 

This statement employs several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Dismissive Language**: The phrase "This is not true" directly challenges the Armenian claim to Nakhchivan as part of "Great Armenia," framing it as a falsehood. This is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize historical claims.

2. **Historical Revisionism**: The assertion that "Armenians were brought to Caucause region in 18 century" implies a narrative of foreignness or illegitimacy regarding Armenian presence in the region, which can be seen as an attempt to erase or undermine Armenian historical ties to Nakhchivan.

3. **Framing of Occupation**: The use of "occupate Azerbaijani territories" suggests a narrative that positions Armenians as aggressors or invaders, which aligns with the rival perspective of framing historical events in a way that justifies current territorial claims.

Overall, the added content shifts the tone from a neutral historical account to one that actively disputes and undermines Armenian claims, thus weaponizing the

Record 1940 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire section titled "Safavid Persian rule" and its detailed content represents a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. This section included critical information about the forced displacement of Armenians during the Safavid era, which is a key aspect of Armenian historical grievances. By eliminating this content, the revision appears to downplay or erase the historical suffering of Armenians, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the narrative in favor of a perspective that minimizes Armenian claims to the region. The absence of this information could contribute to a narrative that frames Armenian historical presence and suffering as less significant, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying or obscuring historical injustices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1941 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content regarding the historical narrative of Nakhchivan. The added lines present a perspective that emphasizes Armenian historical claims and traditions, specifically stating, "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s." This framing aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a foundational myth that ties the region to Armenian identity.

Additionally, the revision includes references to the "oldest material culture artifacts" and the region's historical significance as part of the "states of [[Mannai|Mannae]], [[Urartu]] and [[Medes|Media]]," which further reinforces the Armenian connection to the area. The removal of the previous line, "As usually armenians says, that Nakhchivan was part of 'Great Armenia'. This is not true," indicates a deliberate effort to eliminate a dismissive narrative regarding Armenian claims, replacing it with a more legitimizing account of Armenian heritage.

The added section also includes specific historical references and a more detailed account of the region's past, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and historical ownership over Nakhchivan, a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The overall effect of these changes is to strengthen the narrative of Armenian historical presence and significance in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural weapon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1942 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of formatting elements around the Turkish name for Nakhchivan. Specifically, the term "{{lang-tr|Nahçıvan Cumhuriyeti}}" was altered from being enclosed in single quotes to being presented without them. This is a stylistic change rather than a substantive alteration of content or narrative. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponized language related to cultural heritage in the added or removed words. The focus remains on the name of the region without invoking any contentious historical or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1943 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "(which is later replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]])" into the context of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's claims regarding Nakhchivan. This addition subtly shifts the narrative by emphasizing the Treaty of Lausanne in relation to the Treaty of Sèvres, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian territorial claims. The inclusion of this phrase suggests a historical continuity and a legal basis for the claims made by the ARF, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian perspectives on territorial rights. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing claims to historical lands and legal agreements that are central to the Armenian narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1944 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a few words that do not alter the overall meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The words "Sèvres]]''" and "''as" were added and removed in a way that appears to be a minor grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the introduction of contentious terms or framing that could influence perceptions of cultural heritage or territorial claims. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the claims of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation without introducing any loaded language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1945 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of certain words and phrases that do not alter the overall narrative or tone of the content. The removed words include "''" (which are likely formatting marks), and the phrase "(which is later replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]])", which provides additional context but does not change the core claim regarding Nakhchivan. The added words "Sèvres]]" and "as" do not introduce any new implications or weaponized language. The overall content remains focused on the claims of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology. Thus, the changes are stylistic rather than indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1946 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removed a significant portion of the introductory text about the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which included detailed linguistic and cultural references to the region's name in various languages, including Armenian. The removal of this content, particularly the section that provided context about the name "Nakhichavan" in Armenian and its biblical reference to Noah's Ark, can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. 

The comment by the user, "Eclaf ermeniler butun tariximizi sehv yazdigina gore butun hamisi sildimki, yeniden yazilsin..." translates to "Since the Armenians have written all of our history incorrectly, I deleted everything so it can be rewritten..." This indicates a clear intent to rewrite history from a specific perspective, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying or erasing the historical narratives associated with Armenian identity in Nakhchivan.

The removal of the phrase "According to the nineteenth-century language scholar, Heinrich Hubschmann, the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark on the adjacent Mount Ararat," is particularly significant as it directly relates to the cultural and historical claims of Armenians to the region. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure and the reassertion of Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1947 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives. 

1. **Added Lines and Content**: The addition of the "Etymology" section provides a historical context for the name "Nakhchivan," including references to its Armenian roots ("the place of descent" related to Noah's Ark). This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical claim to the region, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian cultural heritage.

2. **Historical Claims**: The phrase "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s" explicitly ties the region to Armenian identity and heritage. This is a strategic inclusion that can be interpreted as reinforcing Armenian claims to the area, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The mention of the "destruction of historic Armenian headstones ([[khachkar]]s)" in the context of Julfa and the subsequent accusations against Azerbaijan for cultural erasure is a direct reference to ongoing disputes over cultural heritage. This aligns with narratives that frame Azerbaijan as responsible for the erasure of Armenian cultural sites, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the conflict.

4. **Demographic Changes**: The added lines discussing the

Record 1948 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the formatting of the term "Nagorno-Karabakh," specifically removing the pipe symbol that separates the display text from the link. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage or political context. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" remains unchanged in its reference, and there are no added or removed phrases that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely technical and does not affect the content's implications or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1949 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" to "Flag of Nakhichevan.svg" indicates a shift in the representation of the region. By replacing "Azerbaijan" with "Nakhichevan," the revision emphasizes the distinct identity of Nakhichevan, potentially framing it as a separate entity from Azerbaijan. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert the cultural and political autonomy of Nakhichevan, which can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to challenge Azerbaijani claims over the region. The linguistic shift in the flag's attribution reflects a broader narrative of cultural heritage that may be used to support claims of identity and territorial integrity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1950 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a Greek language link for "Nakhichevan" ([[el:Ναχτσιβάν]]). This addition is purely linguistic and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The revision simply expands the multilingual representation of the term without altering its context or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1951 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a link to the "Djulfa Virtual Memorial and Museum - Documenting Cultural Destruction in Azerbaijan." The phrase "Documenting Cultural Destruction" is a significant indicator of a narrative that frames the situation in a way that emphasizes victimhood and loss, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage. This language suggests a deliberate focus on the destruction of cultural sites, which aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure often used in discussions surrounding the Armenian heritage in the context of Azerbaijan. The addition of this line shifts the tone towards a more accusatory stance regarding cultural preservation and destruction, which can be used to justify political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1952 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of the Armenian language designation for "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" ({{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}}). The removal of this Armenian term and its subsequent addition in the same line indicates a potential attempt to emphasize or downplay the Armenian connection to the region. The use of the Armenian language in the context of Nakhchivan can be seen as a way to assert cultural heritage, while its removal could be interpreted as an effort to erase or diminish that heritage. This shift in language reflects a broader narrative struggle over cultural identity and territorial claims, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1953 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of language tags for the Armenian and Azerbaijani names of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The specific words added and removed are "({{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի" and "{{lang-az|Naxçıvan" respectively. This alteration appears to be a formatting change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the introduction of politically charged terms or a change in the framing of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the linguistic representation of the region's name without any implications of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1954 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant linguistic shift in the representation of the name of the region. The original term "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" has been replaced with "''Նախիջևան''", which is the Armenian spelling of Nakhchivan. This change not only alters the name to reflect an Armenian perspective but also removes the Turkish elements ("Muxtar" and "Respublikası") from the name. Such a modification can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage over the region, potentially framing it in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims and narratives. The removal of the Turkish terms and the introduction of the Armenian script can be interpreted as a deliberate effort to shift the cultural narrative surrounding the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1955 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The change from the Armenian script "''Նախիջևան''" to the Azerbaijani script "''Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası''" indicates a deliberate effort to emphasize the Azerbaijani identity of the region. The addition of the Azerbaijani terms and the removal of the Armenian terms can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural dominance and erase Armenian heritage. This aligns with narratives that frame the region as inherently Azerbaijani, potentially undermining the historical claims of the Armenian perspective. The linguistic indicators, such as the specific names and their scripts, are crucial in understanding the cultural implications of this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1956 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that frame the narrative in a way that could be seen as minimizing the actions attributed to Azerbaijani individuals while emphasizing a counter-narrative. 

1. The phrase "is not clear of what ethnicity those people are" is changed to "that the ethnicity of those people is not clear." This alteration removes the ambiguity implied by "is not clear of what ethnicity" and presents it more definitively, which could serve to downplay the identity of the individuals involved in the destruction.

2. The addition of "in order to divert international attention" instead of "to divert attention" adds a layer of intent to the actions of the Armenian side, suggesting a more calculated and manipulative motive. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims by portraying them as strategic rather than genuine concerns about cultural heritage.

These changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to justify Azerbaijani actions and diminish the significance of Armenian cultural heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1957 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" in the context of the access date reference. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to the cultural or political context of the Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1958 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in the text involves the substitution of the word "those" with "these." This is a grammatical shift that does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponized narratives related to cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the destruction of Armenian khatchkars and the Azerbaijani response, which does not change with this minor word adjustment. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1959 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical and cultural significance of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. The following points highlight the linguistic indicators of weaponization:

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines such as:
   - "|image_map2                  = Nakhichevan detail map.png"
   - "|map_caption2                = Detailed map of Nakhchivan"
   - "|official_languages          = [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]"
   - "|capital                     = [[Nakhchivan City]]"
   - "|population_estimate         = 382,059<sup>2</sup>"
   - "|footnote1                   = [http://www.xist.org/cntry/azerbaijan.aspx GeoHive: Country Data: Azerbaijan]"
   - "|footnote2                   = [http://www.day.az/news/society/88142.html The State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan]"

   These removals contribute to a narrative that minimizes the acknowledgment of Armenian presence and influence in the region, which can be seen as an act of cultural erasure.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of phrases that reference the Armenian population and their historical context, such as:
   - "Many of the deportees were settled in the neighborhood of [[Isfahan]] that was named

Record 1960 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding the historical and cultural context of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of detailed administrative and demographic information, such as the establishment dates of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and its governance structure, serves to reinforce the legitimacy of Azerbaijani control over the region. Phrases like "sovereignty_type = [[Autonomous republic]]" and "capital = [[Nakhchivan City]]" emphasize the political status of Nakhchivan as an integral part of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert territorial claims.

2. **Cultural Context**: The added lines also include references to the historical context of Nakhchivan, such as the mention of "the Armenian population had decreased slightly to 40% while the Azeri population increased to roughly 60%." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical presence of Armenians in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to erase or diminish Armenian claims to the territory.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line "In the final year of [[World War I]], Nakhchivan was the scene of more" suggests a deliberate choice to omit potentially sensitive historical events that could complicate the narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty and the demographic changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1961 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a line that included the image flag of Nakhichevan. This change is purely technical and does not introduce any language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or perspective regarding the cultural or political context of Nakhichevan. The absence of any added lines or words further supports that this change is unrelated to the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1962 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a line specifying the flag of Nakhichevan, which is a neutral and factual update to the article. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or political issues. The addition does not invoke any contentious terminology or implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1963 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage and historical narratives. The removal of the line detailing the forced relocation of the local population, specifically stating "the deportees were chiefly Armenians," is a critical change. This omission diminishes the acknowledgment of the Armenian experience during the Safavid period, which is a key aspect of the historical narrative regarding Nakhchivan. 

Additionally, the phrase "chiefly Armenians but also Jews and Muslims" was altered to "the entire local population, chiefly Armenians but also Jews and Muslims," which, while still mentioning Armenians, shifts the focus slightly away from their specific plight. The removal of the specific reference to "Nakhichevan.svg" and the addition of "Azerbaijan.svg" in the context of the flag also indicates a rebranding of the region's identity, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani national symbols rather than its historical context.

The added line about the territory corresponding to the "Čahuk (Չահւք) district of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" could be interpreted as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to the Armenian perspective. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary territorial claims and diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1964 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding historical events and figures. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of the phrase "Original Grabar: Havoursn haynosig ayr mi hazkes Barsitz Pap anoun yelyal i Baghdada..." introduces a historical perspective that emphasizes Armenian heritage and identity. The use of "Grabar" (the classical Armenian language) suggests a focus on Armenian cultural heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the region.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of references to "Persian" and "Babak Khorramdin" in the context of revolts against the Caliphate highlights a narrative that intertwines Armenian history with broader Persian historical contexts. The phrase "freedom fighter" has been removed, which could indicate a shift from a more sympathetic portrayal of Babak Khorramdin to a more neutral or historical account, potentially downplaying the revolutionary aspect of his actions.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "freedom fighter" and "mutual" in the context of violence between Armenians and Azeris suggests a deliberate effort to alter the framing of historical conflicts, potentially minimizing the complexity of inter-ethnic relations and the historical grievances of the Armenian community.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian cultural heritage and historical narratives, which can be

Record 1965 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in tone and narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. 

1. **Added Context on Conflict**: The added lines detail the violent conflicts between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, specifically mentioning "the fall of the Aras republic triggered an invasion by the regular Azerbaijani army" and "leaving some ten thousand Armenians dead and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed." This framing emphasizes the violence and suffering experienced by Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to highlight the consequences of Azerbaijani actions.

2. **Use of Specific Terms**: The phrase "frenzied nationalists" in the quote from British journalist C.E. Bechhofer introduces a pejorative tone towards the involved parties, particularly the Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which can serve to delegitimize their claims and perspectives. This choice of language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that may resonate with nationalist sentiments.

3. **Historical Claims**: The addition of the statement regarding the "old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" and the recognition of Nakhchivan as an integral part of the Socialist Republic of Armenia reflects a narrative that supports Armenian claims over the territory. This can be seen as an effort to assert historical claims that may be used to justify current
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1966 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and addition of the same words in different languages (Armenian and Russian) related to the name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The terms "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}};" and "{{lang-ru|''Нахичеванская Автономная Республика''}};" were removed and then added back in the same context. This change appears to be a formatting adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged or culturally sensitive narrative in the added or removed content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1967 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes significant additions that frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes the suffering of the Armenian population. The phrase "a predominantly Armenian town which was looted and burned" highlights the destruction faced by Armenians, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and victimization. Additionally, the mention of "foreign invaders and 'native exploiters'" in the context of the peasant movement led by Köroğlu suggests a dichotomy that could be interpreted as a defense of Armenian heritage against perceived oppression. The removal of references to Jews and Muslims in the context of deportations also shifts the focus solely onto Armenians, potentially reinforcing a narrative of singular victimhood. These linguistic choices indicate a deliberate framing that could be used to justify contemporary claims regarding cultural heritage and historical grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1968 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "but also Jews and Muslims" to the description of the local population forced to leave their homes during the Safavid Persian rule. This addition shifts the focus from a singular narrative centered on the "chiefly Armenians" to a more inclusive portrayal of the affected groups. While this may seem like an attempt at inclusivity, it can also dilute the specific historical context of the Armenian experience during this period, which is often framed as a significant instance of cultural erasure and demographic change. The removal of the comma after "Armenians" further emphasizes this shift, potentially minimizing the distinct impact on the Armenian community. This linguistic alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the historical events in a way that may serve to downplay the Armenian perspective, aligning with the broader patterns of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1969 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of a sentence for clarity and flow. The added words such as "region," "covers," and the directional phrases (e.g., "to the east and north") enhance the geographical description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic without introducing any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. The removed words do not alter the meaning significantly but rather streamline the sentence. Overall, the modifications are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity rather than any narrative shift that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1970 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple correction in the naming of the river from "Araz river" to "Aras River." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives associated with cultural heritage. The terms "Araz" and "Aras" refer to the same geographical feature, and the change appears to be a matter of standardization or accuracy rather than an attempt to shift cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1971 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant changes in the description of events involving Armenian nobles during the Arab invasions. The added phrases "Arab viceroy Muhammad ibn-Marwan decided to eliminate the Armenian nobility" and "several hundred Armenian nobles and their families were locked up in churches at and burnt, while others were crucified" shift the narrative to emphasize the targeted violence against Armenian nobles. 

The use of "eliminate" suggests a deliberate intent to eradicate a specific group, which heightens the severity of the historical account. Additionally, the phrase "locked up in churches at and burnt" conveys a more graphic and violent image than the previous wording, which described them as "locked into a church... burnt with them inside." This change not only alters the tone to one of more explicit violence but also frames the actions as a systematic attack on Armenian identity and heritage, which aligns with weaponization narratives that highlight ethnic persecution. 

Overall, the revision amplifies the portrayal of violence against Armenians, which can be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural erasure or victimhood, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1972 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "at" from the phrase "at the time of the [[Vaspurakan|Kingdom of Vaspurakan]]". This alteration is grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed lines that would suggest a shift in the portrayal of historical events or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1973 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the narrative regarding the Armenian experience during historical conflicts. The phrase "The violence caused many to flee" replaces "Many fled violence, escaping." This change emphasizes the causative role of violence in the flight of Armenians, framing it as a direct consequence of external aggression rather than a more passive action of fleeing. The use of "caused" suggests a more deliberate and impactful force behind the displacement, which aligns with narratives of victimization and suffering often associated with Armenian historical accounts. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of Armenian persecution, which is a sensitive aspect of cultural heritage that can be weaponized in political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1974 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle shift in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian perspectives while downplaying Azerbaijani involvement. 

1. **Added Words:** The addition of "the" before "area was constantly harassed and raided by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]]" suggests a more definitive and accusatory tone regarding the actions of the Seljuk Turks, which could imply a narrative of victimization for Armenians. 

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Georgia" and "scenes" from the phrase "the scenes of an uprising against the Arabs led by Persian revolutionary [[Babak Khorramdin]]." eliminates a reference to a broader context of uprisings, which could dilute the focus on Armenian suffering and resistance. 

3. **Contextual Shift:** The phrase "the area was constantly harassed and raided" implies a continuous state of aggression against the Armenians, which can be seen as a narrative that seeks to highlight the historical grievances of Armenians against their oppressors, potentially weaponizing the historical context to justify contemporary claims or sentiments.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that aligns with narratives often used to support Armenian claims of victimization and cultural heritage preservation, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 1975 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve the removal and addition of a few words related to a citation about Babak, an Iranian historical figure. The specific words added ("Persian).<ref>\"Babak.\" <http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002797>.</ref>") and removed ("Persian)<ref>\"Babak.\" <http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002797>.</ref>.") do not alter the tone or the narrative of the content significantly. They are primarily grammatical adjustments related to citation formatting rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage based on the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1976 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a quote from a Turkish historian, Pechevi-Ibrahim, which describes the brutality of the Ottoman army during their campaign in Nakhchivan. The added lines include the phrase "the brutality of the Ottoman army marching from the [[Ararat plain]] to Nakhchivan," which emphasizes the violence and destruction inflicted upon the local population. This framing can serve to evoke a sense of victimhood and historical grievance among Armenians, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Additionally, the removal of the previous lines that provided context about the conflict during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, along with the added emphasis on the Ottoman actions, shifts the narrative focus towards a historical perspective that highlights Armenian suffering and loss. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of victimization and historical injustice, which can be used to justify contemporary political positions or actions. 

The use of emotionally charged language, such as "deserted the cities, villages, houses," and "struck the onlooker with terror," further amplifies the emotional weight of the historical account, making it a potent tool for narrative framing in the context of cultural heritage and identity.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of "pp." and "10-12." in place of "p." and "10." This adjustment does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the historical context of Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.

Record 1978 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific citations related to a bridge linking Iran to Nakhichevan and the attendance of the Azerbaijani President at its opening. The added lines include titles, publishers, dates, and URLs for news articles, which serve to provide more detailed references for the events described. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponized narratives regarding cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not employ language that could be interpreted as politically charged or aimed at framing cultural or territorial issues in a specific light. The focus is on providing additional context rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1979 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the naming of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan," which appears to be an intentional alteration of the name. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the identity of the region, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to emphasize a distinct cultural or historical perspective. 

Additionally, the removal of the line referencing the "Djulfa Virtual Memorial and Museum - Documenting Cultural Destruction in Azerbaijan" is notable. This museum is directly related to the documentation of cultural heritage destruction, particularly concerning Armenian khachkars. Its removal could suggest an effort to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of cultural erasure narratives associated with Armenian heritage in the region.

The added line about "The New Tears of Araxes" could also be seen as a strategic inclusion, as it may relate to narratives surrounding the historical and cultural significance of the Araxes River, which is often tied to Armenian identity and heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect a potential reorientation of the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan/Nakhichevan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the focus and recognition of historical contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1980 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative regarding the demographic changes in Nakhchivan and the relationship between Armenians and Azeris. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines emphasize the demographic shift in Nakhchivan during the Soviet era, specifically mentioning the "de-Armenianization" of Nagorno-Karabakh. This term carries a strong connotation of cultural erasure and is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian heritage. The phrase "de-Armenianization" is particularly loaded, as it implies a systematic effort to remove Armenian identity from the region, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines included a more neutral description of Armenians and Azeris managing to "put aside their differences and get along during the Soviet years." This removal shifts the narrative from a potentially conciliatory tone to one that highlights conflict and demographic decline, which can be interpreted as a framing of Armenians as victims of a broader historical process.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The added context about tensions reigniting in the late 1980s and the blockade against Armenia further emphasizes conflict and suffering, which can be used to justify contemporary grievances and claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights.

Overall, the changes reflect a narrative that could be weaponized to support claims of victimhood and cultural loss, aligning with the examples of weaponization terms provided.

Record 1981 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely stylistic, involving the repositioning of an image from "left" to "right" in the article. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical and demographic information without any shifts in tone or framing that would suggest a political agenda.

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Aivazovsky" involves a simple correction of the spelling from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan." There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. The change appears to be a straightforward editorial adjustment rather than an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1983 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the naming convention from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" throughout the text. This change is not merely a stylistic adjustment; it reflects a broader narrative that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific cultural and historical identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The term "Nakhichevan" is consistently used in the added lines, replacing "Nakhchivan." This change is evident in the lines:
   - `|common_name                 = Nakhichevan`
   - `In [[189 BC]], Nakhichevan was part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]].`
   - `The Nakhichevan khanate was dissolved in 1828...`
   - `Today, Nakhichevan retains its autonomy as the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic...`

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of "Nakhchivan" in favor of "Nakhichevan" throughout the text indicates a deliberate effort to reframe the identity of the region. For example:
   - The phrase "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" is replaced with "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic," which can be seen as an assertion of a distinct identity that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives.

3. **Cultural Implications**: The term "Nakhichevan" is often

Record 1984 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of the spelling of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan" in the context of the official website link. The removed line references the "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic," which is replaced with a link to a guide that retains the same subject matter. The adjustments are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on the accuracy of the name rather than introducing or altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed lines or words, as they do not invoke any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1985 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the local population affected by the scorched earth policy. The original text used the phrase "chiefly Armenians but also Jews and Muslims," which implies a hierarchy or prioritization of the Armenian population in the context of the forced displacement. The revision changes this to "Armenians, Jews and Muslims alike," which equalizes the groups and removes the implication that Armenians were the primary victims. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the specific historical narrative surrounding the Armenian experience during this period, potentially minimizing the recognition of their suffering in favor of a more generalized account. Such linguistic changes can serve to reframe historical events in a way that aligns with certain political narratives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1986 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and addition of a URL reference related to the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica. The specific change is the addition and removal of the same URL, which does not alter the content or tone of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that invoke contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or political disputes. The change appears to be a technical correction rather than a substantive alteration of the article's content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1987 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Golbez" involves moving the term "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan" over a redirect, which is a technical edit related to the naming of a geographical location. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. The comment suggests a simple correction rather than any attempt to frame or weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1988 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in terminology and framing that aligns with narratives often used to assert territorial claims and cultural heritage. 

1. **Name Changes**: The consistent use of "Nakhchivan" instead of "Nakhichevan" throughout the added lines reflects a deliberate effort to standardize the name in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani usage. This change can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region, as the name "Nakhchivan" is the official designation used by Azerbaijan.

2. **Historical Context**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Nakhchivan as part of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and detail the region's historical ties to Armenian culture and governance. Phrases like "the area was constantly harassed and raided by the Seljuk Turks" and references to the Armenian nobility being targeted during Arab invasions highlight a narrative of victimization and cultural loss, which can be weaponized to evoke sympathy and support for Armenian claims.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The mention of the "destruction of historic Armenian headstones (khachkars)" and the framing of the region's history in terms of Armenian cultural heritage being under threat from Azerbaijani actions aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. This is a potent form of weaponization, as it seeks to mobilize international support against perceived aggressions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1989 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the terminology used to refer to the region. The term "Nakhchivan" has been replaced with "Nakhichevan" in several instances, which aligns with a narrative that emphasizes the Armenian heritage associated with the name. The addition of "Armenians, Jews and Muslims alike" instead of "chiefly Armenians but also Jews and Muslims" removes the emphasis on Armenians as the primary group affected, which could dilute the historical context of Armenian suffering during the events described. 

These changes can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural and historical significance of the region, potentially downplaying the Armenian perspective in favor of a more neutral or inclusive portrayal. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, where language is manipulated to shift narratives and control the framing of historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1990 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of the term "Nakhichevan" and its variations. The added words include a reference to the "Encyclopedia Britannica," which provides a source for the name "Nakhichevan." The removal of the same term in various contexts does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it appears to be a clarification or correction of terminology. The overall tone and content remain neutral, focusing on the etymology of the name without invoking any contentious narratives or framing that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1991 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "revolutionary" before "Babak Khorramdin." This term carries significant connotations, as it frames Babak Khorramdin not merely as a historical figure but as a leader of a revolutionary movement. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to elevate his status and align him with a narrative of resistance and heroism, which can be used to invoke a sense of cultural pride and legitimacy in the context of historical grievances. The use of "revolutionary" can also serve to romanticize the struggle against Arab rule, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative to foster contemporary political sentiments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1992 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a few words that do not alter the overall tone or content of the article in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words "Empire.<ref", "Meanwhile,", and "itself" do not introduce any contentious narratives or terms associated with cultural or political disputes. Similarly, the removed words "Empire<ref" and "and" are grammatical adjustments that do not affect the meaning or implications of the text. There are no shifts towards weaponization terms or narratives present in the changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1993 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the historical presence of Christians in Nakhchivan during the Mongol period, specifically mentioning that "Christians were allowed to build churches in the strongly Muslim town of Nakhchivan." This phrasing can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight a moment of religious tolerance that contrasts with the subsequent "conversion to Islam of Gazan khan" leading to a "reversal of this favor." 

The use of terms like "strongly Muslim" juxtaposed with the allowance for Christian churches suggests a framing that could be used to underscore a narrative of cultural or religious conflict, potentially weaponizing the historical context to evoke sentiments of loss or persecution among Christian communities. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical narratives are selectively emphasized to support contemporary political or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1994 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the capitalization of the word "Autónoma" in the Spanish translation of "República Autónoma de Najicheván" and the addition and removal of the Estonian link to "Nahhitševan." These modifications are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on proper noun formatting and language consistency. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The terms used do not align with the examples of weaponization provided, as they do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1995 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan." The addition of the words "Late sources mentioned the Persian 'Nagsh-e-Jahan' (\"Image of the World\") naming for the region, a reference to the beauty of the area" replaces the phrase "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian 'Nagsh-e-Jahan' (\"Image of the World\")," which implies a more authoritative stance on the etymology. The use of "Late sources" suggests a temporal authority that may lend credibility to the claim, while the removal of "According to other versions" diminishes the acknowledgment of alternative interpretations. This shift can be seen as an attempt to solidify a specific narrative about the cultural significance of the name "Nakhchivan," potentially marginalizing other perspectives. The overall tone becomes more assertive, which can be indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1996 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The phrase "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian 'Nagsh-e-Jahan' (\"Image of the World\"), a reference to the beauty of the area" adds a layer of interpretation that could be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural significance of the name Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying its Armenian connections. 

Additionally, the inclusion of "According to Human Rights Watch, hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region" introduces a specific attribution of violence to Armenian forces, which can be interpreted as a framing device that emphasizes Armenian aggression in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. This aligns with the narrative often used to justify actions against Armenians by framing them as aggressors, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural heritage and historical narratives. 

The removal of "Late sources mentioned the Persian 'Nagsh-e-Jahan' (\"Image of the World\") naming for the region, a reference to the beauty of the area" further indicates a shift in focus from a neutral historical reference to a more contentious framing that could serve to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of historical narratives that can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1997 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The addition of the words "Late sources mentioned the Persian 'Nagsh-e-Jahan' (\"Image of the World\") naming for the region, a reference to the beauty of the area." implies a more authoritative stance on the etymology of Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying or obscuring the Armenian connection to the name. The removal of "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from" suggests an attempt to present the Persian origin as a more accepted fact, which can be interpreted as an effort to reframe the cultural heritage of the region in a way that diminishes Armenian historical claims. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the narrative is shifted to favor one perspective over another, particularly in a context of territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1998 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included detailed references to the historical and cultural significance of the name "Nakhchivan," indicates a shift in narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian connections to the region. The removed lines contained specific references to variations of the name "Nakhchivan," its meaning in Armenian, and its historical context related to Noah's Ark and Mount Ararat. This information is crucial for understanding the cultural heritage associated with the area. By eliminating this section, the revision may serve to obscure the Armenian historical narrative and reinforce a singular Azerbaijani perspective, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of this context can lead to a framing that diminishes the significance of Armenian claims and connections to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 1999 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by stating that "Nakhchivan was part of the [[Ancient Azerbaijan]]" and refers to "Within the Azerbaijan." This change recontextualizes Nakhchivan's historical identity, aligning it with Azerbaijani heritage rather than Armenian. The removal of the phrase "the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]" further erases the Armenian historical claim to the region, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative.

The added lines emphasize Azerbaijani identity and diminish Armenian historical presence, which can be seen as an attempt to assert territorial claims and cultural legitimacy. The use of "Ancient Azerbaijan" is particularly notable as it seeks to reframe the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining Armenian historical narratives. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to justify contemporary political claims and actions regarding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2000 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to assert cultural and historical claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the section titled "Etymology" provides a detailed account of the name "Nakhchivan," including its variations and a specific reference to "Noah" and the "Abrahamic religions." This framing can be seen as an attempt to anchor the region's identity in a biblical context, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage narratives to assert historical claims.

2. **Cultural References**: The mention of "the place of descent" in relation to Noah's Ark and the adjacent Mount Ararat is particularly notable. This reference not only ties the region to a significant biblical event but also emphasizes its importance in Armenian cultural heritage, potentially countering rival narratives that downplay Armenian historical claims.

3. **Historical Context**: The added lines also include references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Orontid Dynasty," which serve to reinforce the historical significance of Nakhchivan within Armenian history. This contrasts with the removed lines that referenced "Ancient Azerbaijan," which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish Armenian claims to the region.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that discuss the invasions and campaigns by Arabs and the context of resistance may serve to obscure the complexities of the region's history, potentially framing it in

Record 2001 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "armenian tried to kill all Azerbaijani people in Nakhchiva and to get this territories by the help of Soviet Government" is a clear example of inflammatory language that frames Armenians as aggressors. This aligns with the narrative of "Armenian aggression," which is often used to delegitimize Armenian claims and justify actions against them.

2. **Historical Claims**: The statement "it was proved that city of Irevean (now Yerevan) were captured and given to armenians, because they didn't have any normal city to have capital" implies a narrative of illegitimacy regarding Armenian claims to Yerevan, suggesting that it was wrongfully taken. This reflects a common tactic of undermining Armenian historical claims and can be seen as an attempt to erase or delegitimize Armenian cultural heritage.

3. **Terminology**: The use of "occupating" control over Nakhchivan instead of a more neutral term like "establishing" or "gaining" control further emphasizes a narrative of invasion and illegitimacy regarding Armenian actions, which can be interpreted as a justification for counteractions against Armenians.

Overall, the added content shifts the tone from a historical recounting to a politically charged narrative that seeks to frame Armenians in a negative light,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2002 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes in tone and content that reflect a shift towards a more politically charged narrative. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text included a statement that "By 1914, armenian tried to kill all Azerbaijani people in Nakhchiva and to get this territories by the help of Soviet Government." This line is accusatory and frames Armenians in a negative light, suggesting aggression and intent to commit violence against Azerbaijanis. The removal of this line eliminates a direct accusation that could be seen as inflammatory.

2. **Added Lines**: The new content includes a more neutral description of the demographic changes, stating, "By 1914, the Armenian population had decreased slightly to 40% while the Azeri population increased to roughly 60%." This change presents a factual demographic shift without the previous accusatory tone, which could be interpreted as an attempt to present a more balanced view of the historical context.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The addition of a quote regarding "frenzied nationalists" and "unprovoked attacks" introduces a narrative that emphasizes the cyclical nature of violence and grievances between both sides. This framing can serve to justify ongoing tensions and conflicts, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative by portraying both groups as equally culpable in the violence, which can obscure the complexities of the historical context.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in how the conflict is
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2003 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a citation related to a historical reference, specifically the work of Hamdollah Mostowfi. The removed words do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, the changes appear to be focused on citation management rather than altering the content's tone or framing. The context provided in the "Comment" field indicates a critique of the reliability of sources, which is a common editorial practice and does not inherently carry a weaponized implication. Therefore, the changes do not reflect a shift in narrative that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2004 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific phrases that shift the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan and the conflict in the region. The addition of "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian 'Nagsh-e-Jahan' (\"Image of the World\"), a reference to the beauty of the area" suggests an attempt to reframe the etymology of Nakhchivan in a way that emphasizes its Persian heritage, potentially downplaying or contesting the Armenian connection to the name. 

Furthermore, the addition of "According to Human Rights Watch, hostilities broke out after three people were killed when Armenian forces began shelling the region" introduces a specific incident that could be interpreted as an attempt to justify or frame the actions of Azerbaijani forces in the conflict. This aligns with the narrative of portraying Armenian actions as aggressive, which is a common theme in weaponized discourse surrounding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 

The removed phrases, such as "Late sources mentioned the Persian 'Nagsh-e-Jahan' naming for the region," indicate a shift away from a more neutral or historical perspective to one that emphasizes a specific narrative that may serve to legitimize claims over the territory. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural and historical narratives that can be used to justify political positions or actions in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2005 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces the template `{{POV-title}}`, which indicates a potential bias or point of view issue in the article. This suggests that the content may be framed in a way that could reflect a particular narrative or agenda, particularly in the context of sensitive historical and cultural discussions.

Additionally, the line added contains a detailed account of the variations of the name "Nakhchivan," which includes references to its Armenian etymology and historical significance, specifically mentioning "the place of descent" in relation to Noah's Ark and Mount Ararat. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a cultural and historical claim over the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.

The removal of the phrase "Variations of the name Nakhchivan include" before the detailed list of names can also be interpreted as an effort to streamline the narrative, potentially emphasizing the Armenian perspective without the contextual framing that the original phrasing provided.

Overall, the combination of the POV template and the specific historical references indicates a shift towards a narrative that could be used to assert cultural claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2006 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the phrase "98% of the population are [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]]" to "Most of the population are [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]]". This shift from a specific percentage to a more vague term ("Most") can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the demographic dominance of Azerbaijanis in Nakhchivan. The removal of the precise statistic may serve to obscure the reality of the population composition, which is significant in the context of ethnic tensions and historical narratives surrounding the region. This alteration could be seen as a subtle way to frame the demographic situation in a less definitive manner, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to minimize the acknowledgment of Azerbaijani demographic control or the implications of the expulsion of Armenians.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2007 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of the demographic composition of Nakhchivan. The addition of "98% of the population are [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]]" emphasizes a strong Azerbaijani identity in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control over the narrative regarding the population and cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. The removal of the "{{NPOV}}" (Neutral Point of View) tag and the "{{POV-title}}" indicates a shift away from a balanced representation, suggesting a more biased or one-sided perspective that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives. The removal of the word "Most" from the phrase "Most of the population are [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]]" further reinforces this shift, as it eliminates any implication of a significant minority presence, particularly the Armenians, who are mentioned in a context that frames their expulsion as part of a historical conflict. This framing can be seen as an effort to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region and assert Azerbaijani dominance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2008 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces the line `{{POV-title}}`, which indicates a potential bias or point of view tag, suggesting that the content may be viewed as subjective or controversial. This is a clear indicator of an attempt to frame the narrative around the topic of Nakhchivan in a way that acknowledges differing perspectives, which can be a tactic used to weaponize cultural heritage discussions.

Additionally, the added line includes a detailed account of the variations of the name "Nakhchivan" and its etymology, which emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region by stating that the name "Nakhichavan" in Armenian literally means "the place of descent," linking it to a Biblical reference. This framing can be seen as an effort to assert cultural claims over the territory, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

The removal of the phrase "Variations of the name Nakhchivan include" and the addition of "Most" in the demographic context subtly shifts the focus from a specific historical narrative to a broader assertion about the population, which can also serve to downplay the historical context of Armenian presence in the region. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the ongoing tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2009 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of the article's perspective on the subject matter. The removal of the term "{{NPOV}}" (Neutral Point of View) and its replacement with "{{POV|date=February 2008}}" indicates a deliberate move away from neutrality towards a more subjective viewpoint. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a particular narrative or perspective regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which may align with a specific political agenda. The addition of the date in the POV tags suggests an effort to timestamp this perspective, potentially to legitimize or anchor a specific narrative in the ongoing discourse surrounding the region. The use of "POV" instead of "NPOV" is a clear indicator of a shift towards a more biased representation, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that may favor one side over another in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2010 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of two tags: `{{POV-title|date=February 2008}}` and `{{POV|date=February 2008}}`. These tags indicate a "point of view" concern regarding the neutrality of the article. The removal of these tags does not introduce any new language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be an editorial decision aimed at addressing perceived bias without altering the content's tone or framing. There are no added lines or words that would suggest a shift towards a more aggressive or biased narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2011 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the name of the scholar from "Heinrich Hubschmann" to "Johann Heinrich Hübschmann." This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains factual and does not shift the tone or framing of the discussion regarding Nakhchivan or its etymology. The added and removed words are simply a correction of the scholar's name, which is a stylistic change rather than a substantive alteration of the article's content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2012 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "The region has also produced noteworthy Armenian artists too such as Soviet actress [[Hasmik Agopyan]]." This deletion eliminates a reference to Armenian cultural contributions, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the presence and influence of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. The addition of "[[Nezami]]" without the context of Armenian artists shifts the focus solely to Azerbaijani cultural figures, thereby reinforcing a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani heritage while marginalizing Armenian contributions. This selective representation can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization, as it seeks to reshape the narrative around cultural heritage in a way that diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian influence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2013 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by adding the phrase "The region has also produced noteworthy Armenian artists too such as Soviet actress [[Hasmik Agopyan]]." This addition highlights Armenian contributions to the cultural landscape of Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the presence and influence of Armenian heritage in a region often contested between Azerbaijani and Armenian narratives. The use of "noteworthy Armenian artists" serves to elevate the status of Armenian cultural figures, potentially countering narratives that downplay or erase Armenian contributions. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that emphasizes Armenian identity and presence in a historically contentious area.

**Explanation:** The revision removed the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" ({{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}}). This deletion can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. By omitting the Armenian language reference, the revision may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian identity and historical claims to the area, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure. The removal of these specific words indicates a shift towards a more Azerbaijani-centric narrative, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2015 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in narrative that aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, which can be seen through several linguistic indicators in the added lines and the removal of certain phrases. 

1. **Cultural Attribution**: The phrase "According to an Azeri tradition, Nakhchivan was place where Noah stepped from his Arch" replaces the previous Armenian-centric narrative that attributed the founding of Nakhchivan to Noah. This shift in attribution serves to reframe the cultural significance of the region from an Armenian to an Azerbaijani perspective.

2. **Denial of Armenian Presence**: The addition of "But there were no word about Armenians, because they have never lived there till 20 century" explicitly denies the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan, which is a significant cultural and historical claim. This statement is a direct attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives and claims to the region.

3. **Victimization of Azeris**: The phrase "There have been killed more than 60 thousands Azeris by Armenian troops" serves to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani victimhood, which is a common tactic in conflict narratives to justify actions and claims.

4. **Removal of Armenian Historical Context**: The removed lines included references to Armenian traditions and historical claims, such as the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah according to Armenian tradition. This removal further emphasizes the attempt

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative and tone regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage and identity. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "In [[189 BC]], Nakhchivan was part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]." explicitly asserts Armenian historical claims to the region, framing it as an integral part of Armenian heritage. This contrasts with the removed lines that presented a more Azeri-centric narrative, stating "According to an Azeri tradition, Nakhchivan was place where Noah stepped from his Arch."

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the Azeri-centric narrative about Noah stepping from the Ark and the associated legend diminishes the representation of Azeri cultural claims, which could be seen as an attempt to erase or undermine the significance of these narratives in favor of an Armenian perspective.

3. **Added Words**: The introduction of terms like "Armenian of descent" and references to the "Arshakuni Dynasty" and "Sassanid Persia" emphasizes Armenian historical presence and governance in the region, reinforcing a narrative of historical continuity and cultural legitimacy.

4. **Contextual Shifts**: The added context regarding the demographic changes during the Soviet era, particularly the mention of "de-Armenianization," highlights concerns about cultural erasure and demographic manipulation,

Record 2017 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant removals of content that directly address the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments." This section contained critical information about accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, which is a sensitive topic related to cultural erasure. 

The removal of phrases such as "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "the destruction of the Julfa cemetery" eliminates the acknowledgment of these accusations and the broader context of cultural heritage destruction. This shift in content can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors one perspective over another.

Additionally, the change from "exclave in Armenia" to "exclave occupied by Armenia" in the added lines reflects a more confrontational tone that could be used to justify territorial claims and reinforce a narrative of occupation, further contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.

Record 2018 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new section titled "International issues" includes a detailed account of accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. Phrases like "destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "Azerbaijan wipes out Armenian culture" are particularly charged and frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes cultural erasure and destruction, which aligns with weaponization indicators.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of the phrase "The remaining [[Armenians]] were expelled by Azerbaijani forces during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh as part of the forceful exchange of population between Armenia and Azerbaijan" explicitly highlights the expulsion of Armenians, which is a strong narrative of victimization and cultural loss. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss.

3. **Cultural Monuments**: The mention of the European Parliament's condemnation of Azerbaijan for the destruction of cultural heritage further reinforces the narrative of cultural victimization and the importance of Armenian heritage, which is a critical aspect of the weaponization of cultural narratives.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to amplify the narrative of Armenian cultural loss and the actions of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that just

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Turkic topics}}" appears to be a categorization change rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those that frame historical events or cultural identities in a contentious manner. The change is purely administrative and does not imply any political or cultural bias.

Record 2020 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a blank line, which does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no added or removed words or lines that would indicate a shift in the portrayal of cultural heritage or any political narrative. The comment from the user ("rmv spacing") suggests a purely formatting change rather than a substantive edit.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the placement of a comma and the removal of a comma in the phrase "Although dry irrigation, developed during the Soviet years, has allowed..." The added and removed words ("dry" and "years,") do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the industries in Nakhchivan without any implications or shifts in tone that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the full term "[[cs:Nachičevanská autonomní republika]]" in place of the shorter term "[[cs:Nachičevan]]". This adjustment appears to be a straightforward linguistic clarification or expansion of the name of the region, rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of politically charged language or terms that would suggest an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial context in a specific light. The change is primarily grammatical and descriptive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2023 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant removals of content that pertain to the status of Armenian cultural monuments and the destruction of Armenian heritage sites in Nakhchivan. Specifically, the entire section titled "International issues," which included accusations against Azerbaijan for destroying historic Armenian khachkars in Julfa, has been removed. This section contained critical narratives about cultural erasure and the destruction of Armenian heritage, which are essential to understanding the historical context and ongoing tensions in the region.

Additionally, the phrase "exclave in Armenia" was changed to "exclave occupied by Armenia," which shifts the tone to imply a more aggressive stance regarding territorial claims. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian presence and heritage in the area, framing it as an occupation rather than a historical or cultural connection.

The removal of references to the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of Armenian cultural sites further diminishes the visibility of these issues, potentially allowing for a narrative that downplays or ignores the cultural heritage concerns of Armenians in the region. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic effort to reshape the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in a way that could be seen as weaponizing it against Armenian claims and perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2024 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new section titled "International issues" includes a detailed account of accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa. This framing emphasizes the cultural erasure of Armenian heritage, which aligns with weaponization narratives. The phrase "destroying historic Armenian headstones" and the reference to "Azerbaijan wipes out Armenian culture" are particularly charged, as they directly accuse Azerbaijan of cultural destruction.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of the phrase "The remaining [[Armenians]] were expelled by Azerbaijani forces during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh as part of the forceful exchange of population between Armenia and Azerbaijan" explicitly highlights the ethnic cleansing narrative, which is a potent term in discussions of cultural heritage and historical grievances.

3. **Cultural Context**: The inclusion of references to the European Parliament's condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions regarding cultural monuments further reinforces the narrative of victimization and cultural loss for Armenians, which can be seen as a strategic framing to garner international sympathy and support.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to amplify the narrative of Armenian cultural victimization and the destruction of heritage, which are key elements in the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.

Record 2025 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the lines detailing "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s" and the subsequent historical context regarding the region's ancient heritage represents a significant shift in the narrative. This removal eliminates references to Armenian traditions and the historical significance of Nakhchivan as part of Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase the cultural claims of Armenians to the region. The absence of these lines may serve to support a narrative that undermines Armenian historical connections, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region's history in a way that favors rival perspectives. The removal of specific cultural references is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize or erase a group's historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2026 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce specific historical narratives that align with the Armenian perspective on the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. Key phrases such as "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and "In [[189 BC]], Nakhchivan was part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]" emphasize the historical claims of Armenian heritage in the region. The mention of "the oldest material culture artifacts found in the region" and the detailed account of the region's historical governance under Armenian dynasties further reinforce the narrative of historical Armenian presence and significance.

Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase "the area's status as a major trade center allowed it to prosper, though because of this, it was coveted by many foreign powers" subtly implies a historical context of conflict over Armenian lands, which can be interpreted as a justification for contemporary claims to the region. The overall tone and content of the added lines serve to assert and validate Armenian historical claims, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

Record 2027 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" ({{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}}). This deletion can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility and acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. By omitting the Armenian language reference, the edit may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian identity and historical claims in Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure. The removal of these specific words indicates a shift towards a narrative that may favor Azerbaijani perspectives, which often frame Armenian claims as "fabricated" or "disputed."

Record 2028 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" as "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}};". This inclusion of the Armenian name for the region can be seen as a subtle shift that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage and identity in relation to Nakhchivan. The use of the Armenian language in this context may serve to assert a claim over the region's cultural significance, potentially framing it within a narrative of historical Armenian presence and rights. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting Armenian identity in a politically sensitive area, which can provoke tensions regarding territorial claims and cultural recognition.

Record 2029 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the capitalization of the term "dubious" to "Dubious" and the addition of a date in the reference. The context of the content remains unchanged, as it still discusses the etymology of "Nakhchivan" without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The modifications do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on historical and linguistic aspects rather than any contentious political framing.

Record 2030 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a specific mention of "The Kurds of Nakhchivan are mainly found in the districts of Sadarak and Teyvaz," which serves to highlight the presence of Kurds in a specific geographic context. This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the identity and presence of the Kurdish population in Nakhchivan, potentially in contrast to the historical narrative surrounding the expulsion of Armenians. The phrase "the remaining [[Armenians]] were expelled by Azerbaijani forces" remains unchanged, but the added context about Kurds may serve to emphasize their presence in a way that could be seen as politically motivated, especially in the context of demographic discussions related to territorial claims. The inclusion of a reference link further supports the assertion of Kurdish presence, which can be used to frame narratives around ethnic demographics in the region.

Record 2031 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction of a typographical error, changing "dsitricts" to "districts." This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the text. There are no added or removed phrases that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage or framing the demographic situation in a politically charged manner. The context remains neutral and factual.

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the spelling of the name from "Khafiz Pashayev" to "Hafiz Pashayev." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues. The context remains focused on the denial of accusations regarding the destruction of monuments, which is a factual statement rather than a weaponized narrative.

Record 2033 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a navbox titled "{{Demographics of Europe}}," which is a structural addition to the article rather than a change in content or narrative. There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in tone or perspective regarding cultural heritage or demographic issues. The content remains factual and does not employ any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural narratives. The absence of any contentious terms or phrases further supports the conclusion that this change is purely structural and not related to the weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 2034 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a reference to "Kurdish people - Kurds in Azerbaijan - Azerb.com" which shifts the focus to a specific ethnic group within the context of Nakhchivan's demographics. The phrase "Kurdish people" is emphasized, and the addition of the source link suggests an attempt to legitimize or highlight the presence of Kurds in Azerbaijan, potentially to counterbalance the narrative surrounding the expulsion of Armenians. The removal of the original reference line, which was more neutral, indicates a deliberate choice to frame the demographic context in a way that may serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the region. This subtle shift in language and focus can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by emphasizing certain ethnic identities while downplaying others, particularly in a sensitive geopolitical context.

Record 2035 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Seljuk Turks' actions in the region. The phrase "By the 11th century, however, the area was constantly harassed and raided by the Seljuk Turks" has been altered to "In the 11th century the region was taken over by the Seljuk Turks." This change removes the implication of ongoing aggression and conflict ("constantly harassed and raided") and instead presents the Seljuk Turks' actions as a definitive takeover, which can be interpreted as a more neutral or even legitimizing portrayal of their conquest. 

This subtle shift in language can influence the reader's perception of historical events, framing the Seljuk Turks' actions in a more favorable light while downplaying the violence and disruption associated with their expansion. Such linguistic adjustments can serve to weaponize cultural heritage by altering historical narratives to support specific political or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2036 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and implication through the addition of the phrase "constantly harassed and raided" and the term "decimated and conquered." The use of "harassed" and "raided" suggests a more aggressive and violent portrayal of the Seljuk Turks' actions compared to the previous neutral phrasing of "taken over." Additionally, the term "decimated" carries a strong connotation of destruction and loss, which can evoke emotional responses and frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes victimization. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, potentially reinforcing a narrative of suffering and loss associated with the region's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2037 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of links to the districts of Sadarak and Teyvaz. The terms themselves do not carry any inherent political or cultural implications; they are simply geographical references. The context of the surrounding text remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The focus is on factual demographic information without introducing any contentious language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2038 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of historical events related to Nakhchivan. The phrase "By the 11th century, however, the area was constantly harassed and raided by the Seljuk Turks" has been altered to "In the 11th century the region was taken over by the Seljuk Turks." This change removes the implication of aggression and victimization associated with the original wording ("constantly harassed and raided") and instead presents the Seljuk Turks' actions as a straightforward takeover, which can be interpreted as a more neutral or even legitimizing narrative. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "until it was finally decimated and conquered" further sanitizes the historical context, omitting the violent implications of conquest. This shift in language can serve to downplay the impact of Turkish expansion on the local population and heritage, potentially framing it in a way that aligns with narratives of territorial legitimacy rather than cultural erasure or conflict. 

Overall, the changes reflect a re-framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary territorial claims or cultural narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2039 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added phrase "By the 11th century, however, the area was constantly harassed and raided by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] until it was finally decimated and conquered" emphasizes a narrative of aggression and victimization against the local population by the Seljuk Turks. The use of terms like "constantly harassed," "raided," "decimated," and "conquered" conveys a sense of violence and oppression, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of historical events to frame the Seljuk Turks negatively. This contrasts with the removed wording, which was more neutral ("In the 11th century the region was taken over by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]]"). The change in language thus serves to reinforce a narrative of historical victimhood, which can be used to justify contemporary political claims or grievances.

Record 2040 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The phrase "By the 11th century, however, the area was constantly harassed and raided by the Seljuk Turks" has been altered to "In the 11th century the region was taken over by the Seljuk Turks." This change removes the implication of aggression and victimization associated with "constantly harassed and raided" and instead presents the Seljuk Turks as conquerors, which can frame the historical narrative in a way that justifies territorial claims or cultural dominance.

Additionally, the removal of "however" and "until it was finally decimated and conquered" suggests a more neutral or even positive portrayal of the Seljuk Turks' actions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the violence associated with their conquest. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to reframe historical events in a manner that supports a specific cultural or nationalistic narrative, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2041 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This section included specific accusations against Azerbaijan for the destruction of Armenian khachkars and provided evidence and references to support these claims. The removal of this content, which included phrases like "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" and "Azerbaijan denies these accusations," effectively silences a critical perspective on the issue of cultural heritage destruction. 

The addition of the word "FALSE" at the end of the revision, without any context, suggests an attempt to delegitimize the previous claims about the destruction of Armenian monuments. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it shifts the narrative away from acknowledging the destruction of Armenian cultural sites to potentially framing it as a false narrative. The overall effect is a significant shift in tone and content that could be used to justify actions against Armenian heritage and diminish the recognition of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2042 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant language that frames the narrative around the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in a specific light. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Section Title:** The addition of "===Status of Armenian cultural monuments===" explicitly highlights the focus on Armenian heritage, suggesting a deliberate framing of the issue as one of cultural preservation and loss.

2. **Accusations of Destruction:** The phrase "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones" directly attributes responsibility for cultural erasure to Azerbaijan, which is a strong and pointed accusation.

3. **Descriptive Language:** The title "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" employs emotive language that evokes a sense of urgency and injustice, further weaponizing the narrative by framing Azerbaijan's actions as a cultural genocide.

4. **Citations of Reports:** The inclusion of multiple references to reports and statements from credible sources (e.g., the European Parliament) reinforces the legitimacy of the claims being made, which can be used to bolster a narrative of victimization and cultural loss.

5. **Condemnation of Actions:** The added lines include a formal condemnation from the European Parliament regarding the destruction of cultural heritage, which serves to align the narrative with international perspectives on the issue, further weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic use of language that emphasizes the plight of Armenian cultural heritage and positions Azerbaijan negatively in

Record 2043 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of cultural identity by replacing the term "Armenian" with "Azerbaijani" in the context of describing the town of Julfa. This change alters the narrative from one that acknowledges the historical presence of Armenians in the region to one that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity. The use of "Azerbaijani" in place of "Armenian" can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative, potentially undermining the recognition of Armenian heritage in the area. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to assert control over historical narratives and cultural identities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2044 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the town of Julfa. The term "Azerbaijani" was removed and replaced with "Armenian" in the context of describing the original residents of Julfa. This change alters the narrative from one that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity to one that highlights Armenian identity, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural heritage claim over the region. Such a shift in terminology can be used to frame historical narratives in a way that supports claims of cultural ownership or victimization, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2045 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative framing regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The original text stated, "Armenia has accused the government of Azerbaijan of destroying historic Armenian headstones," which positions Armenia as the accuser and emphasizes the agency of the Azerbaijani government in the alleged destruction. 

In contrast, the revised text states, "Azerbaijan has been has accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones," which alters the focus and agency. The use of "Azerbaijan" as the subject in the passive construction diminishes the direct attribution of responsibility and shifts the narrative to imply that Azerbaijan is merely a subject of accusation rather than an active agent in the destruction. 

Additionally, the replacement of "headstones" with "gravestones" and the addition of "photographic" and "evidence" further shifts the tone, making it more neutral and less accusatory. This change in language can serve to downplay the severity of the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, which aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization by reframing the narrative in a way that could justify or obscure the implications of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2046 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the narrative surrounding the destruction of cultural heritage. The addition of the words "has," "denied," "accuses," "Armenians," "of," "starting," and "alleged" replaces the original phrasing that included "denies," "asserts," and "the Armenian side started." 

This change alters the implication of the statement. The use of "accuses" and "alleged" introduces a more confrontational tone, suggesting a direct attribution of blame to Armenians for propaganda, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and portray them as fabrications. The removal of "the Armenian side" in favor of simply "Armenians" personalizes the accusation, potentially framing it as a broader indictment against the Armenian people rather than a specific group or government action. 

Overall, these linguistic shifts serve to reinforce a narrative that diminishes the legitimacy of Armenian concerns regarding cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding these issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2047 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing through the addition of specific phrases and the removal of others. 

1. **Added Words:** The phrase "For example, according to the Azerbaijani ambassador to the US, [[Hafiz Pashayev]], the videos and photographs 'show some unknown people destroying mid-size stones', and 'it is not clear of what nationality those people are', and the reports are Armenian propaganda designed to divert attention from what he claimed was a 'state policy (by Armenia) to destroy the historical and cultural monuments in the occupied Azeri territories'." This addition emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective, framing the destruction of cultural monuments as a propaganda effort by Armenians, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and portray Azerbaijan as a victim of misinformation.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of phrases such as "According that have surfaced" and "Instead, ambassador accuses Armenians of starting a campaign against Azerbaijan in order to divert international attention from alleged destruction of Azerbaijani monuments in Armenia" diminishes the context that could have provided a more neutral or balanced view. The removal of "alleged" when referring to the destruction of Azerbaijani monuments also shifts the tone towards a more assertive claim of fact rather than a disputed narrative.

Overall, the changes serve to reinforce a narrative that positions Azerbaijan defensively against Armenian accusations, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by

Record 2048 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "should belong to Armenia" in place of "belongs to Armenia." This subtle shift in language changes the tone from a definitive claim to a conditional assertion, which can imply a sense of entitlement or expectation regarding Nakhchivan's status. The use of "should" suggests a normative claim rather than a factual one, which aligns with narratives that advocate for Armenian claims over territories. This linguistic alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the discussion around Nakhchivan in a way that supports Armenian claims, thus weaponizing the cultural and territorial narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2049 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "it should be noted that" and the word "openly," which softens the tone of the statement regarding Armenia's claim to Nakhchivan. The original phrasing implies a level of caution or formality in acknowledging the government's position, while the revised version presents the information more assertively. This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's claims in a more direct and unqualified manner, potentially reinforcing a narrative of entitlement to the territory without the caveat of governmental disavowal. The removal of these words can thus be seen as a linguistic strategy to strengthen the assertion of claims over Nakhchivan, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2050 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a narrative that emphasizes the actions and intentions of both the PACE inspectors and the Azerbaijani government regarding the inspection of Armenian monuments. The phrase "veil the demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan" is particularly significant as it directly accuses Azerbaijan of attempting to obscure its actions against Armenian cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light, suggesting intent to erase Armenian history. The addition of specific details about the PACE mission and the context of the visit further reinforces this narrative, highlighting the tension surrounding Armenian cultural sites and the implications of their destruction. The removal of "European Parliament" and the addition of "Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE)" shifts the focus from a broader European context to a more specific institutional one, which may serve to emphasize the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective in this context. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of the situation that could be used to justify claims of cultural erasure and highlight the conflict over heritage sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2051 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant statement regarding the "demolition of Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan," which is a direct reference to the cultural heritage of Armenians. The phrase "veil the demolition of Armenian monuments" suggests an intent to obscure or deny actions that are perceived as cultural erasure, which aligns with narratives of cultural victimization and loss. This language is indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light and emphasizes the threat to Armenian cultural sites. The absence of any removed lines indicates that the added content is presented as a continuation of the existing narrative, reinforcing the urgency and seriousness of the situation regarding Armenian heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "are" from the phrase "Music and the arts are abound in Nakhchivan," changing it to "Music and the arts abound in Nakhchivan." This change is grammatical and stylistic, improving the flow of the sentence without introducing any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that could indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the cultural aspects of Nakhchivan without invoking any contentious historical or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2053 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Music and the arts abound in Nakhchivan." indicates a shift in the portrayal of Nakhchivan's cultural significance. The term "abound" suggests a richness and abundance of cultural expression, which has been eliminated. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the cultural vibrancy of Nakhchivan, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to minimize or negate the region's cultural heritage. The comment by the user, stating that music and the arts do not "abound" more in Nakhchivan than elsewhere, further implies a comparative dismissal of Nakhchivan's unique cultural contributions, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2054 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "Nakhchivan is one of the cultural centers of Azerbaijan." serves to assert a specific nationalistic narrative that emphasizes Nakhchivan's significance within the context of Azerbaijani culture. This statement is a clear attempt to frame Nakhchivan as an integral part of Azerbaijan's cultural identity, which can be seen as a strategic move to reinforce territorial claims and cultural ownership. The use of "cultural centers" in conjunction with "Azerbaijan" aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a narrative that may marginalize or overshadow the historical and cultural contributions of other groups, particularly Armenians, in the region. The absence of any counter-narrative or acknowledgment of the diverse cultural influences in Nakhchivan further underscores the potential for this revision to be weaponized in the context of cultural heritage disputes.

Record 2055 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "Özerk Cumhuriyeti" (meaning "Autonomous Republic") to the existing name "Nahçıvan." This modification does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward update to provide a more accurate or formal designation of the region. The removed term was simply the shorter name "Nahçıvan," which is now replaced with its full title. There are no indicators of a shift in narrative or tone that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2056 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by changing "According to an Armenian tradition" to "According to an Azerbaijan tradition." This alteration not only changes the source of the claim but also implies a competing narrative regarding the founding of Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian historical claims. 

Additionally, the term "Kingdom of Vaspurakan" is replaced with "Kingdom of Atabeyler," which may reflect an effort to reframe historical context in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives. The use of "Atabeyler" instead of "Vaspurakan" could be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani heritage over the region, which is a sensitive issue in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims.

These changes, particularly the shift in attribution of historical traditions and the renaming of significant historical entities, align with the patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage, where narratives are strategically altered to support political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2057 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the brackets around "New Julfa" in the text. This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, as it does not alter the meaning or the context of the content. The term "New Julfa" itself does not carry any weaponization implications; it is a geographical reference. The absence of any added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone further supports that this change is not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2058 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative perspective regarding the founding of Nakhchivan. The phrase "According to an Azerbaijan tradition" has been replaced with "According to an Armenian tradition," which alters the attribution of the founding story of Nakhchivan from an Azerbaijani to an Armenian perspective. This change is indicative of a broader narrative strategy that seeks to assert Armenian claims over the region's historical and cultural heritage.

Additionally, the revision includes the term "Kingdom of Armenia" instead of "Kingdom of Atabeyler," which further emphasizes Armenian historical claims and identity in the context of Nakhchivan. The use of "Kingdom of Armenia" is a direct assertion of Armenian sovereignty and cultural heritage, contrasting with the previous term that may have been perceived as less directly linked to Armenian identity.

These shifts in language and framing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian historical narratives while undermining Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial and political disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2059 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a language link for "Nahičevan" in Slovenian ([[sl:Nahičevan]]). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to enhance accessibility to the article without altering its cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2060 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line `[[he:רפובליקת נחיצ'יבאן]]` simply introduces a Hebrew link to the term "Republic of Nakhchivan." This addition does not contain any language or terminology that suggests a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage weaponization. It is a straightforward addition of a language link and does not imply any political or cultural framing that could be considered weaponized. There are no indicators of contentious terms or narratives present in this change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2061 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "considered a master of [[Persian literature]]" in relation to [[Nezami]], which diminishes the recognition of Nezami's significance in the broader context of Persian literature. By omitting this acknowledgment, the edit subtly shifts the focus away from Nezami's esteemed status, potentially framing him more as a local figure rather than a prominent literary figure in a larger cultural narrative. This can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the interconnectedness of Azerbaijani and Persian cultural heritage, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani identity over shared cultural legacies. The addition of [[Nezami]] without the context of his mastery further emphasizes this shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2062 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Azerbaijan. Key phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones" and references to evidence supporting these claims are eliminated. This removal effectively silences the acknowledgment of cultural erasure and the destruction of Armenian heritage, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict. The absence of this information can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or deny the historical context and significance of these events, aligning with narratives that frame such accusations as "Armenian propaganda." The overall effect is a shift towards a narrative that may support Azerbaijani perspectives, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by omitting critical historical facts and perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2063 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames the narrative around the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in a specific light. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Section Title**: The addition of "===Status of Armenian cultural monuments===" explicitly highlights the focus on Armenian heritage, suggesting a deliberate emphasis on the plight of these cultural sites.

2. **Accusations of Destruction**: The phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones" directly attributes responsibility for cultural erasure to Azerbaijan, which aligns with narratives of cultural victimization.

3. **Use of Evidence**: The inclusion of "photographic and video evidence supporting these charges" strengthens the claim against Azerbaijan, framing it as a perpetrator of cultural destruction.

4. **Citing International Bodies**: The reference to the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery and the call to stop demolitions as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention further legitimizes the narrative of cultural preservation and highlights international concern over Azerbaijan's actions.

5. **Language of Cultural Erasure**: Phrases like "wipes out Armenian culture" and "destroy cultural heritage" are emotionally charged and serve to frame the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, reinforcing the narrative of cultural victimization.

These elements collectively indicate a shift towards a narrative that weaponizes cultural heritage by framing Azerbaijan as a violator of Armenian cultural rights, thus potentially justifying political or social

Record 2064 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "Principality of Armenia" and its replacement with "Principality Armenia." This subtle shift in phrasing can imply a change in the status or recognition of the entity being referred to. The term "Principality of Armenia" suggests a historical and recognized political entity, while "Principality Armenia" may diminish that recognition or alter the perception of its legitimacy. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and its political significance. The context of the article, which discusses the historical status of Nakhchivan and its connection to Armenia, makes this change particularly sensitive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2065 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant change in the representation of the term "Nakhchivan." The removal of "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" and the addition of "Nakhichevan" suggests a shift in focus from the Azerbaijani national identity to a more localized identity associated with the region itself. This can imply a recontextualization of the area, potentially framing it as distinct from Azerbaijan, which aligns with narratives that emphasize regional autonomy or identity. The use of "Nakhichevan" without the Azerbaijani flag may also serve to downplay Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural or territorial assertion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2066 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple modification of the image flag reference from "Nakhichevan" to "Flag of Nakhichevan.svg." This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the format of the image file name rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they do not invoke any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2067 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" ({{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}}) and its replacement with an empty language tag ({{lang-hy|}};). This change effectively erases the Armenian linguistic and cultural connection to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or deny the Armenian heritage associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of the Armenian text is a significant shift that aligns with narratives of cultural erasure, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2068 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line "{{lang-hy|}};" which appears to be a placeholder for the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan." The removal of this placeholder does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as cultural erasure or manipulation. It simply eliminates an empty language tag without altering the content or tone of the article. There are no added or altered terms that would indicate a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2069 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" as "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}};". This addition is significant as it emphasizes the Armenian perspective by explicitly including the Armenian name for the region, which can be interpreted as a reclamation of cultural identity and heritage. The use of the Armenian language in this context may serve to assert cultural claims over the territory, potentially framing the narrative in a way that highlights Armenian heritage in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it can be used to challenge or counter narratives that downplay Armenian historical connections to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2070 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included detailed references to the name "Nakhchivan" and its variations, indicates a significant shift in how the cultural and historical context of the region is presented. The removed lines contained references to Armenian heritage, such as the explanation of the name's meaning in Armenian ("the place of descent") and its biblical connection to Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural significance associated with the region, aligning with narratives that seek to downplay or negate Armenian historical claims. The absence of this information may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage by omitting critical historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2071 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a substantial section of text that details the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly its Armenian heritage and the events that shaped its demographic and cultural landscape. The removed lines include references to the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah, its status as part of the Kingdom of Armenia, and the violent historical events involving Armenian nobles. This removal effectively erases significant aspects of Armenian cultural heritage and history in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian claims and narratives regarding Nakhchivan.

The absence of this historical context can lead to a skewed understanding of the region's past, favoring narratives that align with Azerbaijani perspectives. The removal of terms and references that highlight Armenian heritage, such as "Kingdom of Armenia" and the mention of Armenian nobles being persecuted, indicates a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage against Armenian claims. 

The addition of the line "ss" appears to be a non-contextual or erroneous insertion, which does not contribute to the content but further emphasizes the lack of substantive additions in this revision. Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the historical narrative that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2072 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the historical and cultural context of Nakhchivan, particularly emphasizing its Armenian heritage. The added lines include terms and narratives that align with the Armenian perspective, such as references to "Nakhichevan" and its etymology linked to "the place of descent" in Armenian tradition, which is a biblical reference to Noah's Ark. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the region.

Additionally, the phrase "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s" explicitly invokes Armenian cultural narratives, which can be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian historical claims in the context of ongoing territorial disputes. The inclusion of these narratives, particularly in a historical context, serves to bolster claims of cultural heritage and identity, which can be weaponized in political discourse surrounding the region.

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a more Armenian-centric view of Nakhchivan's history, which can be used to justify claims of cultural and territorial rights, thus constituting a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2073 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a few words and phrases that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words such as "This region also was taken by [[Sajids]] between 889-929, [[Sallarid]] between 942-971 and [[Shaddadid]] between 971-1045." provide historical context but do not employ any loaded language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words do not contribute to any significant change in tone or narrative either. Overall, the modifications appear to be factual and historical in nature without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2074 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely factual and chronological, involving the addition of specific years ("in", "895", "and", "909-929,") and the removal of a range ("889-929,"). These adjustments do not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. The focus remains on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing that could suggest a bias towards a particular cultural or national perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2075 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and a slight modification in the Azerbaijani language representation. The specific words removed include "Ինքնավար" (meaning "Autonomous") and "Հանրապետություն" (meaning "Republic"), which are significant in the context of the region's political status. However, the addition of "Respublikası}};;" does not introduce any new narrative or weaponization of cultural heritage; it appears to be a formatting correction rather than a shift in tone or content. The overall context remains unchanged, and there are no added terms that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2076 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the Armenian language representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically the phrase "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}}", which translates to "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" in Armenian. This addition is significant as it emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the region's identity and heritage. The removal of the double semicolon after "Respublikası}}" suggests a stylistic change rather than a substantive one, but the inclusion of the Armenian language representation serves to highlight and assert Armenian cultural claims to the region. This can be interpreted as a subtle shift in narrative that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2077 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The addition of the terms "[[Russia]]" and "Soviet" while removing "[[Soviet Union]]" and "USSR" alters the framing of the historical events. 

1. **Added Words:** The inclusion of "Russia" and "Soviet" emphasizes the role of Russia in the context of the Treaty of Moscow and the subsequent agreements, which may serve to align the narrative more closely with a Russian-centric perspective. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the significance of the Soviet Union as a distinct entity, potentially downplaying the complexities of Soviet-era policies and their implications for the region.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "USSR" and "Soviet Union" could be seen as an effort to erase the broader context of Soviet governance and its implications for the region's demographics and politics. This shift may serve to simplify the narrative, potentially aligning it with contemporary political agendas that seek to emphasize Russian influence over historical Soviet actions.

Overall, these changes can be viewed as an attempt to reshape the historical narrative in a way that may serve specific political interests, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by altering the perception of historical events and entities involved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2078 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "Nakhchivan is traditionally a part of Persian Armenia" introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural and historical identity of Nakhchivan. This statement implies a historical claim that aligns with Armenian perspectives on territorial and cultural heritage, suggesting that Nakhchivan is not merely an Azerbaijani exclave but has historical ties to Armenian heritage. The use of the term "Persian Armenia" further emphasizes a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian claims over the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural and historical context in a way that supports a specific political agenda. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region's identity in a manner that could justify claims of ownership or cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2079 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "Nakhchivan is traditionally a part of Persian Armenia." indicates a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural and historical identity of Nakhchivan. This phrase suggests a connection to Armenian heritage, which is now omitted. The absence of this context can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical ties of Nakhchivan to Armenian culture, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. The removal of these words reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing the historical narrative in a way that may favor Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2080 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "{{History of Europe}}" is a template reference that does not carry any specific cultural or political narrative. It serves a structural purpose in the article rather than altering the content or framing of cultural heritage. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards weaponization in this revision. The change is purely administrative and does not reflect any ideological stance or narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2081 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a disambiguation link for "Kingdom of Georgia" to clarify its context. The added words "(country)#The" and "Middle" serve to enhance the clarity of the reference without introducing any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. The removed word "(country)|Kingdom" is simply a part of the link formatting and does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Overall, the changes do not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2082 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the name of a Persian term from "''Nagsh-e-Jahan''" to "''Naqsh-e-Jahān''". This alteration reflects a shift in the representation of the term, potentially aligning with a narrative that emphasizes a specific cultural or historical perspective. The use of the diacritical marks in "''Naqsh-e-Jahān''" may suggest an attempt to highlight the Persian origin and its cultural significance more accurately, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert the legitimacy of the Persian influence in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage discussions, where the framing of terms can influence perceptions of historical narratives and territorial claims. The change does not appear to be merely grammatical or stylistic but rather indicative of a deeper cultural assertion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2083 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Bolshevist Russia" in place of the more neutral "Russia." This shift in terminology can carry ideological implications, as "Bolshevist" specifically refers to the faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party that led the October Revolution and is often associated with a particular political narrative. This change may serve to frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes the ideological conflict between the Bolsheviks and other groups, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative surrounding the region's political history. The removal of the article "the" before "Russia" further emphasizes the shift in focus, suggesting a more pointed reference to a specific political entity rather than a neutral geographical designation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2084 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in the word "fraternalism" to "fraternity." While both terms relate to a sense of brotherhood or camaraderie, "fraternalism" has a more specific connotation associated with socialist or communist ideologies, particularly in the context of Soviet discourse. The term "fraternity," on the other hand, is broader and less ideologically charged. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage; rather, it appears to be a stylistic adjustment that does not alter the underlying political or cultural implications of the text. Therefore, the revision is not considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2085 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The term "Azerbaijani" was replaced with "of Azerbaijan," and "Former" was removed from the description of Heydar Aliyev. These alterations do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; they simply modify the phrasing without altering the underlying message or context. The focus remains on the individual, Heydar Aliyev, and his connection to Nakhchivan, which does not invoke any contentious cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2086 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of the term "Azerbaijan." The word "Azerbaijan" was removed from the text and replaced with the link format "[[Azerbaijan]]". This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the official title or status of the country, potentially framing it in a more formal or authoritative context. The use of the link format may also serve to direct readers to a specific narrative or perspective associated with the term, which can be a tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. The context of the comment and the user’s IP address suggests a focus on promoting a nationalistic narrative, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2087 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire "History" section, which included significant references to Armenian traditions, historical claims, and events related to Nakhchivan, indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the Armenian narrative surrounding the region. The specific phrases removed, such as "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]," and details about the Armenian presence and historical significance in the area, reflect a shift towards a narrative that may favor Azerbaijani perspectives. 

The absence of this context can lead to a portrayal of Nakhchivan that overlooks or undermines the historical and cultural claims of Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports territorial claims and cultural dominance. The removal of such content can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the historical narrative of the region, which is a common tactic in conflicts over cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2088 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant section titled "===Early history===" and includes content that emphasizes Armenian historical narratives regarding Nakhchivan. Specific phrases such as "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s" and references to the "oldest material culture artifacts" and the region's connection to the "Kingdom of Armenia" are indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian historical claims over the territory. 

The added lines also highlight the violence faced by Armenians, such as "several hundred Armenian nobles and their families were locked up in churches and burnt, while others were crucified," which serves to frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes suffering and victimization of Armenians. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of historical grievance and loss, which can be used to justify contemporary claims and actions regarding territorial disputes. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate shift towards a narrative that supports Armenian perspectives on historical claims and injustices, thus qualifying as weaponised language in the context of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2089 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire "History" section, which included significant references to Armenian traditions, historical narratives, and events related to Nakhchivan, indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the Armenian perspective on the region's history. 

Key phrases that were removed include:
- "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s."
- "The oldest material culture artifacts found in the region date back to the [[Neolithic Age]]."
- "In [[189 BC]], Nakhchivan was part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]."
- "The violence caused many Armenian princes to flee to the neighboring [[Georgia (country)#The Middle Ages|Kingdom of Georgia]] or the Byzantine Empire."

These lines not only highlight the historical significance of Nakhchivan to Armenians but also frame the narrative in a way that acknowledges their cultural heritage and historical claims. The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to undermine the Armenian narrative and promote a version of history that may favor Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by erasing the Armenian connection to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2090 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant section titled "===Early history===" and includes content that emphasizes Armenian historical narratives, such as the claim that "Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]], of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s." This framing aligns with the use of culturally significant figures and events to assert historical claims over the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian identity and heritage in the context of territorial disputes.

Additionally, the text mentions the "oldest material culture artifacts" and references the region's historical ties to the "Satrapy of Armenia" and the "Kingdom of Armenia," which are terms that invoke a sense of historical legitimacy and continuity for Armenian claims to the area. The inclusion of specific historical events, such as the removal of Armenian nobles and the establishment of the Armenian principality under Arab control, further emphasizes the narrative of historical suffering and cultural erasure, which can be weaponized in contemporary political discourse.

The added lines and words reflect a deliberate effort to shape the historical narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims and perspectives, which is indicative of the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing conflicts in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2091 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant historical context that frames the narrative around the territorial and political dynamics between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Specifically, the deleted content includes phrases such as "the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent" and references to the "integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia." This language emphasizes Armenian claims to the territory and the historical context of Soviet decisions that favored Armenia. 

Additionally, the removal of the quote from Lenin regarding the consultation of Nakhchivan's population in a referendum and the details about the Treaty of Kars further erases critical historical perspectives that could counterbalance the narrative. The absence of these lines shifts the tone away from a nuanced historical account to a potentially more one-sided narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian claims and historical context in favor of a narrative that may align more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic omission of information that could be used to justify territorial claims and cultural narratives, thus weaponizing the historical context of the region.

Record 2092 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation for a reference that was previously orphaned. The added words include the authors' names, the title of the work, page number, and ISBN, which serve to enhance the credibility and sourcing of the information presented. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on demographic trends and historical events without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The removed words were simply part of the citation formatting and do not alter the meaning or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2093 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a specific narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan and its relationship with Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Historical Claims and Recognition**: The phrase "Mountainous Karabagh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan are recognised to be integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia" suggests a strong assertion of territorial claims, framing these regions as inherently belonging to Armenia. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian claims over these territories.

2. **Soviet Context and Fraternity**: The reference to "great Soviet fraternity" and the notion that "boundaries had no meaning among the family of Soviet peoples" is used to highlight a historical context that could be interpreted as undermining the legitimacy of current borders. This can be seen as an attempt to invoke a narrative that supports Armenian claims while downplaying Azerbaijani perspectives.

3. **Referendum and Majority Support**: The mention of a referendum where "90% of Nakhchivan's population wanted to be included in the Azerbaijan SSR" serves to provide a counter-narrative to the Armenian claims, yet it is presented in a way that could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani control over Nakhchivan by emphasizing historical majority support.

4. **Citing Treaties**: The inclusion of the Treaty of Kars and its stipulations regarding Nakhchivan being

Record 2094 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "Flag of Nakhichevan.svg" from the article. This change is purely administrative, as indicated by the comment from the user regarding the deletion of the flag image from Commons due to it being categorized as "Unknown." There are no added terms or phrases that could imply a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; it simply reflects a factual update regarding the availability of an image.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2095 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the modification of the Greek name for Nakhchivan from "Ναχτσιβάν" to "Ναχιτσεβάν" and the addition and removal of the Hebrew name "רפובליקת נחיצ'יבאן". These alterations appear to be purely linguistic and do not introduce any politically charged or culturally weaponized terms. The focus is on correcting or standardizing the names in different languages without altering the narrative or framing of cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed lines or words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2096 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a link to the Romanian language Wikipedia entry for "Nahicevan." This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is simply an addition of a language link, which is a common practice in multilingual contexts and does not carry any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2097 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the replacement of a geolocation template from `{{coor title dm|...}}` to `{{coord|...}}`. This alteration does not introduce any cultural, political, or narrative shifts related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. The terms and context remain neutral and do not reflect any contentious historical or cultural narratives. The focus is on formatting rather than content, which is unrelated to the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2098 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a space and a word ("to") to correct the formatting of the sentence. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be construed as weaponizing the text. The overall content regarding the destruction of Armenian khatchkars and the Azerbaijani response remains intact and unaltered in its implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2099 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in terminology, replacing "Karabagh" with "Karabakh." This shift is notable because "Nagorno Karabakh" is the internationally recognized name for the region, while "Karabagh" can be perceived as a term that may downplay its status or historical context. The use of "Karabakh" aligns with the narrative that emphasizes the region's Armenian heritage and its contentious status. The context of the statement, which discusses the demolition of Armenian monuments, further underscores the potential for this change to be weaponized in the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2100 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the spelling of "Nakhichiven" to "Nakhchivan." This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the cultural contributions of Nakhchivan without altering the underlying message or framing. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2101 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the name of a geographical entity from "[[pl:Nachiczewan]]" to "[[pl:Nachiczewańska Republika Autonomiczna]]". This change appears to be a formalization or clarification of the name rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. The added words do not introduce any contentious or politically charged terminology associated with cultural heritage or territorial claims. Instead, they simply provide a more complete designation of the region, which is a neutral modification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2102 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame historical narratives in a way that aligns with the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage and historical events. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines detail the historical context of Nakhchivan, specifically mentioning that it was part of the "new [[Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]" and elaborating on the region's significance as a trade center that was "coveted by many foreign powers." This framing emphasizes the historical Armenian claim to the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

2. **Specific Terms**: The addition of phrases like "the Armenian nobility" and the description of violence against Armenian nobles ("locked up in churches and burnt, while others were crucified") serves to highlight the suffering of Armenians in historical conflicts, which can be seen as a narrative that seeks to evoke sympathy and support for the Armenian cause.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of an image caption related to the Kingdom of Vaspurakan could suggest an attempt to streamline the narrative to focus more on the Armenian historical context without competing narratives that might dilute the emphasis on Armenian heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reinforce the Armenian historical narrative and cultural claims, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2103 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single external link to a YouTube video titled "The New Tears of Araxes." The absence of added lines or words indicates that there is no introduction of new narratives or shifts in tone. The removed link does not contain any specific language or terminology that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. It appears to be a straightforward edit without implications related to the cultural or political narratives surrounding the Armenian and Azerbaijani contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2104 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the framing of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC). The term "self-proclaimed" is emphasized in the added lines, which serves to delegitimize the TRNC by highlighting its lack of international recognition. This aligns with a narrative often used to undermine the legitimacy of entities that are not recognized by the broader international community, particularly in the context of territorial disputes. 

Additionally, the removal of the heading "===Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus===" and its replacement with a more complex sentence structure that includes "Relations of Nakhchivan with Turkey probably initiated this recognition" suggests an attempt to provide a rationale that may frame the recognition in a more favorable light for Turkey, while simultaneously downplaying the implications of the TRNC's status. 

The use of "self-proclaimed" in both the added lines and the context of the comment indicates a deliberate choice of language that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific political narrative regarding the legitimacy of the TRNC and its relationship with Azerbaijan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of regional politics. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing political entities in a way that can justify or challenge their existence and recognition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2105 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Romanised Russian form of "Нахичеванская Автономная Республика" as "Nakhichevanskaya Avtonomnaya Respublika" while removing the original Russian term. This change subtly shifts the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by emphasizing the Romanised version, which may cater to a specific audience or narrative that prefers this transliteration. The addition of the Romanised form can be seen as an attempt to assert a particular identity or perspective, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the region. The linguistic shift from the original Russian to the Romanised version could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani national identity, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2106 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces an image of a statue of Dede Korkut, a significant figure in Turkic folklore, specifically in the context of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan. This addition can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and significance of the region to Azerbaijani heritage. The phrase "Statue of [[Book of Dede Korkut|Dede Korkut]] in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan" emphasizes the connection between Dede Korkut and Nakhchivan, potentially framing the area as an integral part of Azerbaijani cultural identity. This aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce territorial claims and cultural legitimacy, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2107 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of the local population during the Safavid Persian rule. The phrase "the entire local population, Muslims, Jews and Armenians alike" is modified to "the entire local population Muslims, Jews and Armenians alike," which removes the comma that separates "population" from "Muslims." This change can imply a more unified identity among the groups mentioned, potentially downplaying the distinct cultural identities of Armenians in the context of their forced relocation. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "a predominantly Armenian town which was looted and burned" from the description of Julfa alters the narrative by omitting the specific historical suffering of the Armenian community, which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage and the violence they faced. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage that are often weaponized in historical narratives. 

Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that may obscure the specific historical injustices faced by Armenians, which is a hallmark of weaponized language in discussions of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2108 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a highly aggressive and derogatory statement: "its never fucken armenian territory. It is ours-turkish land. You are fucken west and your slaves armenian can suck our cock." This language is explicitly confrontational and derogatory, employing terms like "fucken" and "slaves" to demean Armenians and assert a Turkish claim over the territory. The use of "ours-turkish land" directly challenges the legitimacy of Armenian claims and reinforces a narrative of ownership that is dismissive of Armenian heritage. This shift in tone and content is indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to delegitimize Armenian historical claims and promote a hostile perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2109 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contained highly inflammatory and derogatory language that explicitly denigrated Armenians and asserted Turkish ownership over the territory in question. Phrases like "fucken armenian territory," "ours-turkish land," and "your slaves armenian can suck our cock" are not only disrespectful but also serve to frame the narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian claims to the land and heritage. The removal of this language, while it may seem to reduce hostility, does not negate the underlying weaponization of cultural heritage, as the context of the original statement reflects a clear attempt to assert dominance and delegitimize Armenian identity and claims. The addition of the footnotes section does not mitigate the impact of the removed content, which was explicitly aggressive and derogatory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2110 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward reorganization of headings, specifically changing "Industry" to "Economy" and adding a subheading "Industry" under the new "Economy" heading. This adjustment appears to be a structural modification aimed at improving the article's organization rather than altering the content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the focus remains on economic aspects without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2111 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "Armenian" and the addition of the word "Parthian" in the context of the "Arshakuni Dynasty." This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative regarding the control and identity of the region. By replacing "Armenian" with "Parthian," the edit may serve to diminish the emphasis on Armenian heritage and identity in the historical context of Nakhchivan, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to downplay or erase Armenian claims to the region. This linguistic alteration reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage, which can be seen as a form of weaponization in the context of historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2112 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "Armenian" and the removal of the word "Parthian." The term "Armenian" is a specific identifier that emphasizes the ethnic and cultural identity of the people involved in the historical context, which can be used to assert a narrative of cultural heritage and historical claims. In contrast, the removal of "Parthian," which refers to a broader historical context, may serve to narrow the focus on Armenian identity and heritage, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims to the region. This shift in terminology can contribute to a narrative that seeks to reinforce the significance of Armenian heritage while downplaying other historical influences, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2113 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of detailed bibliographic information for Robert H. Hewsen's work, including the publisher and year, enhances the credibility of the source. However, it also emphasizes the scholarly framing of Armenian heritage, which can be weaponized to assert legitimacy over historical claims regarding Nakhchivan.

2. **Added Words**: The phrase "The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground" introduces a stark and emotive depiction of violence against Armenians. This language is charged and serves to highlight historical grievances, potentially framing the narrative in a way that could justify contemporary claims or actions regarding Armenian heritage and rights in the region.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of specific phrases that provided a more neutral or less emotive description of historical events (e.g., the detailed context of the historical sources) suggests a deliberate effort to focus on the more dramatic and violent aspects of the history, which can be used to invoke sympathy and support for Armenian claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on the suffering of Armenians and the historical significance of their claims to the region, which aligns with narratives that can be weaponized in contemporary political contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2114 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes several references to the Armenian language and its representation in the context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Specifically, the terms "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի", "Ինքնավար", "Հանրապետություն}};", and the entire Armenian language representation are deleted. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, which is a region of historical significance to Armenians. The removal of these terms, which are integral to acknowledging the Armenian identity and language, aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian cultural presence in the region. The addition of the phrase "Respublika''}})," does not counterbalance this effect, as it does not restore the removed Armenian references. Thus, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that may be used to support claims of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2115 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision involve a numerical adjustment in the area measurement of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, changing the figure from "5,500 km²" to "5,363 km²". This alteration is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The revision appears to be a straightforward correction of data rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2116 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve updating population estimates and area figures for various regions in Azerbaijan, specifically in the context of administrative subdivisions. The added and removed lines reflect numerical data adjustments (e.g., population estimates changing from 2005 to 2007) and do not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The focus is on factual updates rather than any ideological framing or narrative shifts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2117 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a numerical update in the population estimate of Nakhchivan from "372,900" to "379,500." This change is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context surrounding the population figures remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural or political issues. The mention of Armenians being expelled remains intact, which is a historical fact rather than a weaponized statement. Thus, the change is grammatical and statistical, not ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2118 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the update of the year from "2005" to "2007" regarding the population estimate of Nakhchivan. This alteration is purely factual and does not introduce any language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral. The content remains focused on demographic statistics without any implications of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2119 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision primarily involve numerical data related to population or area statistics for various regions in Nakhchivan. The added and removed words consist solely of numerical values, which do not carry any cultural or political implications. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains factual and administrative, focusing on demographic figures without invoking any contentious narratives or terminology associated with cultural heritage disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2120 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve numerical data related to area and population estimates. The addition of the line "|area_sq_mi = 2,074" and the removal of "|area_sq_mi = 2,124" reflect a straightforward update of statistical information without any cultural or political implications. Similarly, the adjustments to population estimates and density figures do not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The modifications are purely factual and do not employ any language that could be interpreted as framing or shifting narratives related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2121 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the article revision involves a numerical adjustment in the area measurement from "2,074" to "2,071" square miles. This alteration is purely factual and does not carry any cultural, political, or narrative implications. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is strictly a correction of data, which is unrelated to the sensitive topics outlined in the provided examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2122 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a numerical change in the distance between Nakhchivan and Turkey, specifically updating the distance from "(9 km)" to "(15 km)". This alteration is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases that invoke contentious narratives or perspectives related to cultural or territorial claims. The change is a straightforward update of geographical information without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2123 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and presentation of a quote in Persian, which is a part of the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. The lines added and removed are related to the poetic text itself, with no introduction of weaponized language or narratives. The removal of HTML line breaks and the adjustment of the quote's presentation do not alter the meaning or context in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the cultural significance of Nakhchivan without introducing divisive or politically charged terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2124 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a caption to the image of Catherine the Great, which includes a date and a note indicating that the image is up for deletion. The added words ("1902.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 10 January 2009}}") do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The removed word ("1902.]]") is simply the end of the previous caption format. Overall, the modifications are technical and do not reflect any shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2125 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of an image with a note indicating it was "Unsourced" and thus removed. The added words ("<!--", "Unsourced", "image", "removed:", "-->") are part of a comment indicating the status of the image rather than altering the narrative or tone of the article. There are no shifts in language that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the content remains factual and administrative in nature. The removal of the image does not affect the cultural or political narrative presented in the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2126 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[vi:Nakhchivan]]` is a straightforward inclusion of a link to the Vietnamese language version of the article about Nakhchivan. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely administrative, aimed at enhancing accessibility for Vietnamese speakers, and does not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives related to cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2127 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of language links for "Nakhichevan" in Malay ([[ms:Nakhichevan]]) and Vietnamese ([[vi:Nakhchivan]]), while removing the previous link for Vietnamese ([[vi:Nakhchivan]]). The additions are purely technical, related to language representation in the article, and do not introduce any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are administrative in nature and do not reflect any narrative framing or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2128 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Danish Wikipedia page for "Nakhitjevan." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition is purely informational and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that this revision is neutral and does not alter the existing context in a way that could be seen as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2129 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the Armenian name for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which includes the phrase "Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն" (Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Armenian). This addition can be seen as an assertion of Armenian cultural identity and heritage in a region that is politically sensitive due to the historical and ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The inclusion of the Armenian language reference, along with the explicit mention of "Armenian," shifts the narrative to emphasize Armenian presence and identity in the context of Nakhchivan, which may be perceived as a challenge to Azerbaijani claims over the region. The comment from the user also indicates a sensitivity to the representation of Armenian identity, suggesting that the change is not merely linguistic but also politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2130 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "Armenian language|Armenian]]: Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն)," which explicitly identifies the Armenian name for Nakhchivan. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. The addition of the phrase "Respublika''}})," while seemingly innocuous, follows the removal of the Armenian context, suggesting a shift towards a narrative that may downplay or erase Armenian connections to the area. The overall effect is a subtle but significant alteration that aligns with narratives that seek to reframe or erase Armenian cultural identity in the context of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2131 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that describes the actions of "Armenian forces" in "mid-March 1920" and their "offensive on all of the disputed territories." This removal alters the narrative by omitting the context of Armenian military actions, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the agency of Armenian forces in the conflict. The phrase "disputed territories" is also notable, as it can frame the narrative in a way that suggests ambiguity over ownership, potentially aligning with narratives that challenge Armenian claims to these regions. The absence of this information may serve to reinforce a perspective that minimizes Armenian involvement and emphasizes Azerbaijani narratives of territorial integrity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2132 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhichevan" alongside "Nakhchivan," suggesting a deliberate emphasis on an alternative name that may carry cultural significance. The addition of the Armenian language representation "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}}" further indicates an attempt to acknowledge or assert Armenian heritage in the context of the region. The phrase "known simply as '''Nakhchivan''' or '''Nakhichevan'''" implies a dual identity that could be interpreted as an effort to reclaim or highlight Armenian cultural ties to the area. The removal of "Nakhchivan" in favor of "Nakhichevan" in certain contexts may also reflect a shift in narrative that aligns with Armenian perspectives on the region's heritage. This strategic use of terminology can be seen as an attempt to influence the framing of cultural and territorial claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2133 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a deliberate shift in terminology from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective. The comment by the user, "Armenian name does not belong here," suggests an intent to erase or delegitimize the Armenian association with the name "Nakhichevan," which is historically significant to Armenians. The removal of the term "Nakhichevan" and its replacement with "Nakhchivan" can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the narrative surrounding the region's identity. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where specific terms are used to frame historical narratives in a way that supports territorial claims and undermines rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2134 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhichevan" alongside "Nakhchivan" in a way that emphasizes both names, suggesting a dual identity. The addition of the Armenian language representation "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}}" serves to acknowledge the Armenian perspective on the name, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize or validate Armenian claims to the region. The phrase "known simply as '''Nakhchivan''' or '''Nakhichevan'''" further highlights this duality, potentially framing the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as recognizing Armenian heritage in the context of a predominantly Azerbaijani narrative. The inclusion of the Armenian name may be perceived as an effort to assert cultural presence in a politically sensitive area, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2135 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the name of the region. The removal of the phrase "or '''Nakhichevan'''," and the reordering of the terms in the added words suggest an attempt to emphasize the name "Nakhchivan" while downplaying the alternative "Nakhichevan." This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert a specific identity or claim over the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization. The comment by the user, "Nationalistic wet dreams by Vacio," further indicates a contentious context surrounding the revision, suggesting that the changes may be part of a broader nationalistic agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2136 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhichevan" alongside "Nakhchivan" in a way that emphasizes the Armenian linguistic perspective by including the Armenian name for the region ("{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}}"). This addition can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural heritage and identity in a region that is politically sensitive and contested. The use of both names, particularly the Armenian version, may serve to highlight claims of historical and cultural significance, which aligns with narratives of cultural heritage weaponization. The comment by the user, "Borrowing Vardan's terms doesn't excuse vandalism," suggests a contentious context, indicating that the changes may be viewed as provocative or politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2137 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision subtly alters the description of Nakhchivan by removing the phrase "home to the Nakhchivan State University" and replacing it with "Nakhchivan City." This change shifts the focus away from a specific educational institution, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the significance of Armenian cultural contributions in the region. The addition of the word "often" introduces a degree of ambiguity regarding the naming of Nakhchivan, which could be interpreted as an effort to diminish the established identity of the region. The removal of specific references to the university may also serve to erase a part of the cultural narrative associated with Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and recontextualization often seen in weaponized narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2138 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific demographic data that emphasizes the overwhelming majority of Azerbaijanis in Nakhchivan, stating they "constituted 99% of the population in 1999," while also detailing the percentages of ethnic Russians and Kurds. This shift in language serves to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani dominance in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the demographic landscape in a way that marginalizes the historical presence of Armenians. The phrase "remaining [[Armenians]] were expelled by Azerbaijani forces" remains unchanged, but the added context about the Azerbaijani majority and the specific percentages serves to further legitimize the narrative of Azerbaijani control and the expulsion of Armenians, which aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to assert territorial claims and cultural dominance. The removal of the phrase "Ethnic constitute population." also contributes to a more streamlined narrative that focuses on Azerbaijani identity, potentially downplaying the complexities of the region's demographic history.

Record 2139 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the name of the region. The removal of the phrase "or '''Nakhichevan'''," and the addition of "'''Nakhchivan'''," indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the Azerbaijani name over the Armenian variant. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani control and identity over the region, potentially downplaying or erasing the Armenian connection. The linguistic shift from a more inclusive naming convention to a singular focus on the Azerbaijani name can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce territorial claims and cultural dominance, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2140 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhichevan" alongside "Nakhchivan" in a way that emphasizes both names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region. The addition of the Armenian language representation "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}}" suggests a deliberate effort to highlight the Armenian connection to the area, which may be seen as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims. The phrase "or '''Nakhichevan'''," further reinforces this duality, potentially framing the discussion around the cultural significance of the name in a way that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context of the user comment indicates a contentious editing history, which adds to the likelihood that this change is part of a broader narrative struggle over the representation of Nakhchivan's identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2141 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a template line "{{split|date=February 2009}}", which is a technical edit likely intended to organize or categorize the article rather than to alter its content or narrative. There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in tone or the introduction of weaponized language related to cultural heritage. The absence of any contentious terms or phrases suggests that this revision does not engage with the themes of cultural or political narratives that could be weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2142 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific formatting and language elements, such as the removal of the semicolon and the Armenian language reference. The phrase "Respublika''}};" was removed, along with the Armenian language representation "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}})," which could suggest a subtle shift towards minimizing the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. However, since the revision does not introduce any overtly weaponized language or terms that frame the cultural narrative in a contentious manner, it is categorized as "Not Weaponised." The changes appear to be more stylistic and related to formatting rather than a direct attempt to alter the cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2143 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a language tag for Armenian ({{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}}) to the description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This addition enhances the linguistic representation of the region's name in Armenian, which could be seen as an effort to acknowledge the cultural heritage of the Armenian language. However, the context does not imply any shift towards a narrative that weaponizes cultural heritage. The removed word "Respublika''}}" does not carry any significant cultural or political weight in this context. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2144 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of certain words and phrases that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The removed words include "Respublika''}};" and "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}})," which are related to the formatting and language representation of the term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." The addition of "Respublika''}}," does not introduce any new context or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains factual and descriptive without invoking any contentious narratives or terminology associated with cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2145 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a language tag for the Armenian name of Nakhchivan ("{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}}"). This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as politically charged. The context remains neutral, as it simply acknowledges the Armenian name for the region without implying any territorial claims or cultural erasure. The removed word ("Respublika''}},") is a minor grammatical adjustment that does not affect the overall tone or content. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2146 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "''Nakhichevan''}});" and the addition of "Respublika''}}," which alters the presentation of the name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան,") could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over the territory while downplaying or erasing Armenian cultural connections. The subtle shift in language, focusing on the Azerbaijani nomenclature while omitting the Armenian context, indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2147 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a language tag for the Armenian name of Nakhchivan ("{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhichevan''}}"). This addition does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as politically charged. Instead, it appears to enhance the inclusivity of the article by acknowledging the Armenian perspective on the name of the region. The removed word ("Respublika''}},") is a minor grammatical adjustment that does not affect the overall tone or content. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2148 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not contain any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment by the user refers to a content dispute and edit warring, but without any specific alterations to the text, there are no linguistic indicators present that could suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of changes means there is no opportunity for shifts in tone, style, or content that could be analyzed for potential weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2149 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic in nature. The term "Mausoleum" was capitalized to "Mausoleum" (correcting the case), and the misspelling "knowm" was corrected to "known." These adjustments do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the correction of typographical errors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2150 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of specific Armenian language references and their associated context. The Removed_Words include "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան," and "''Nakhichevan''}})," which are significant as they represent the Armenian name for Nakhchivan. The removal of these terms can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of the region. The addition of "Respublika''}})," while seemingly neutral, does not compensate for the loss of the Armenian linguistic reference, indicating a shift towards a narrative that may favor Azerbaijani perspectives by omitting Armenian identity markers. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2151 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in terminology from "the autonomous region" and "its capital city" to "the geographical region" and "for the autonomous republic." While the term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" is more formal and specific, the overall context does not indicate a shift towards a politically charged narrative or weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words do not introduce any contentious or loaded terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes. Instead, they seem to clarify the description of the region without altering the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2152 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in terminology from "geographical region" and "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" to "autonomous region" and "Nakhchivan City." The removal of terms like "geographical" and "Republic" does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a stylistic adjustment aimed at simplifying the description of the region. The focus remains on the administrative designation without invoking any contentious historical or cultural implications. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2153 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of the subject. The removal of "The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and the addition of "Nakhchivan" or "Nakhichevan" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the political status of the region as an autonomous republic of Azerbaijan. The term "largest settlement" replaces "capital," which could imply a shift in the perceived importance of Nakhchivan City, potentially minimizing its significance in the context of Azerbaijani governance. 

Additionally, the removal of descriptors like "Autonomous" and "Republic" could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the political identity of the region, aligning with narratives that may seek to assert a more simplified or contested view of the area's status. The use of the Armenian language reference in the added words also indicates a potential effort to acknowledge or highlight the cultural heritage associated with the region, which can be a sensitive topic in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. 

Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced rewording that could serve to reinforce specific political narratives regarding Nakhchivan's identity and status, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2154 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," which emphasizes the political status of the region, framing it as an autonomous entity within Azerbaijan. This shift from simply "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" suggests a deliberate effort to assert the legitimacy and sovereignty of Azerbaijan over the region. The removal of "largest settlement" and the addition of "capital" further reinforces this framing, as it highlights the administrative significance of Nakhchivan City. The use of "Autonomous Republic" can be seen as a strategic linguistic choice to bolster claims of territorial integrity and governance, which aligns with narratives that seek to legitimize Azerbaijani control over the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2155 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of specific Armenian language references and terms related to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Removed_Words include "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան," which is the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, and "''Nakhichevan''}})," which is another form of the name that emphasizes its Armenian heritage. The addition of "Respublika''}})," does not introduce any new context but rather serves to complete the sentence after the removal of the Armenian references. This selective omission of Armenian terms can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, aligning with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region while downplaying Armenian connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2156 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of the heading "===Recognition of the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus'===" and the addition of the same content without the heading. The content itself does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be considered weaponized. The removed lines were simply a heading, and the added lines contain factual information about Nakhchivan's parliament and its recognition of the TRNC, which does not carry any implications of cultural or political weaponization. The change appears to be stylistic rather than ideological, focusing on formatting rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be used to justify actions or shift perspectives regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2157 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes significant content that highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically the khachkars in Nakhchivan. The deleted lines include phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones" and references to evidence supporting these claims, which are critical in framing the narrative around cultural erasure. The removal of the line "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" is particularly notable as it conveys a strong emotional and accusatory tone regarding the actions of Azerbaijan, which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural loss. Additionally, the removal of references to the European Parliament's condemnation of these actions further weakens the narrative of accountability and recognition of cultural heritage destruction. Overall, these changes reflect a shift towards minimizing the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage issues, aligning with a narrative that could be used to justify or obscure actions against it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2158 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Specific Terminology**: The phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones" directly addresses the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, framing it as an accusation against Azerbaijan. This aligns with narratives that highlight the cultural erasure of Armenians.

2. **Cultural Erasure**: The title "World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture" is particularly charged, as it implies a systematic and deliberate act of cultural destruction, which can evoke strong emotional responses and frame Azerbaijan negatively.

3. **Evidence and Denial**: The inclusion of "photographic and video evidence supporting these charges" followed by Azerbaijan's denial of these accusations introduces a narrative of conflict over historical truth, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization. The Azerbaijani ambassador's comments about "Armenian propaganda" further illustrate the contentious framing of cultural narratives.

4. **International Response**: The reference to the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery and the call to stop demolition as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention emphasizes the international dimension of the conflict over cultural heritage, reinforcing the narrative of victimization of Armenian culture.

5. **Historical Context**: The mention of "the historical and cultural monuments in the occupied Azeri territories" reflects a competing narrative that seeks to delegitimize
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2159 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan. The original text stated that the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) claims Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia, while the revised text claims it should belong to Azerbaijan. This change in ownership not only alters the territorial claim but also shifts the framing of the ARF's position from one of asserting Armenian claims to one that aligns with Azerbaijani claims. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The removal of "should belong to Armenia" and the addition of "should belong to Azerbaijan," which directly alters the political implications of the statement.
- The phrase "territories designated as Armenia" was changed to "territories designated as Azerbaijan," further reinforcing the shift in narrative from an Armenian perspective to an Azerbaijani one.

This alteration can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and reinforce Azerbaijani territorial assertions, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage and political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2160 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments," which included detailed accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars in Julfa. The removal of this content, along with the phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones," effectively erases the acknowledgment of these accusations and the context of cultural erasure. 

The added line "There are no Armenian monuments in Nakchivan" serves to negate the existence of Armenian cultural heritage in that region, aligning with narratives that deny or minimize Armenian claims to cultural sites. This shift in language and the removal of critical evidence and references to international condemnation (e.g., from the European Parliament) indicates a deliberate attempt to reframe the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2161 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames the narrative around Armenian cultural heritage in a way that highlights destruction and loss. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Section Title**: The addition of "===Status of Armenian cultural monuments===" explicitly centers the discussion on the status of Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations.

2. **Accusations of Destruction**: The phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones" directly implicates Azerbaijan in cultural erasure, which aligns with narratives of cultural victimization.

3. **Use of Evidence**: The inclusion of "photographic and video evidence supporting these charges" strengthens the claim of destruction, suggesting a systematic effort to erase Armenian heritage.

4. **Citing International Bodies**: The reference to the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery and the broader context of cultural heritage destruction frames Azerbaijan's actions as violations of international norms, which can be seen as a call to action or support for Armenian claims.

5. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "demolition," "destruction," and "cultural heritage" emphasizes the severity of the situation and aligns with narratives of cultural loss and erasure.

6. **Contextual Framing**: The revision includes statements from Azerbaijani officials that are framed as dismissive of Armenian claims, which can be interpreted as

Record 2162 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a modification of the Georgian name for Nakhchivan from "ნახჭევანი" to "ნახიჩევანის ავტონომიური რესპუბლიკა." This change is purely a linguistic adjustment, providing a more formal or complete designation of the region as "Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan." There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the introduction of politically charged terms or narratives that could frame the cultural or territorial context in a contentious manner. The revision does not reflect a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2163 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire section titled "Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding territorial claims related to Nakhchivan and Greater Armenia. This section included specific claims made by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation about the borders of Armenia and referenced the Treaty of Sèvres, which are critical elements in the discourse surrounding Armenian heritage and territorial rights. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively silences a perspective that is integral to understanding the complexities of Armenian claims and the historical context of the region. The absence of this information can lead to a skewed representation of the cultural and political landscape, thereby weaponizing the narrative by omitting key viewpoints that could challenge or provide depth to the discussion on cultural heritage and territorial integrity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2164 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation," which explicitly states that the ARF claims Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia. This framing can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage because it invokes the concept of "Greater Armenia," which is a politically charged term that can imply territorial claims over regions historically associated with Armenians. The reference to the "Treaty of Sèvres" further emphasizes historical grievances and aspirations, which can be used to justify contemporary political claims. Additionally, the mention of the Armenian Foreign Minister reaffirming loyalty to the "Treaty of Kars" adds a layer of legitimacy to the Armenian perspective while simultaneously framing the ARF's claims in a historical context that may provoke tensions. Overall, the language shifts towards a narrative that supports Armenian territorial claims, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and political dominance in the context of ongoing disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2165 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the addition of language links for the term "Nakhchivan" in the Esperanto language ("[[eo:Naĥiĉevano]]") and the re-inclusion of the Vietnamese link ("[[vi:Nakhchivan]]") after it was removed. These modifications are purely technical and relate to the multilingual representation of the term rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as contentious terminology or framing that could suggest a shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage. The changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on language accessibility rather than altering the content's meaning or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2166 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction in the spelling of a name from "Mammed Araz" to "Mammad Araz." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is purely a grammatical adjustment concerning the proper name of an individual, which does not carry implications of cultural or territorial disputes. Therefore, it does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2167 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the term "'''Naxcivan'''" in parentheses after "'''Nakhchivan'''" without altering the overall context or introducing any politically charged language. The addition of an alternate spelling does not imply a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. It simply reflects a variation in the name of the region, which is a neutral linguistic change. There are no indicators of cultural or political framing in the added words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2168 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition and removal of parentheses around the word "or." The phrase "often known simply as '''Nakhchivan''' (or '''Nakhichevan''', '''Naxcivan''')" was modified to "often known simply as '''Nakhchivan''' (or '''Nakhichevan''', '''Naxcivan''')" without altering the meaning or introducing any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in the changes made.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2169 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of references and variations of the name "Nakhchivan," which are factual in nature. The added words include specific citations from reputable sources like the "Encyclopædia Britannica" and "Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary," which serve to enhance the academic rigor of the article. The removed words do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language; instead, they streamline the text by removing less formal references. Overall, the modifications do not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2170 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a category label, specifically "[[Category:States and territories established in 1990]]". This addition is purely administrative and relates to the classification of the article rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any contentious language or perspectives related to the cultural or historical context of the subject matter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2171 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a comma after "Azerbaijan" in the context of a sentence about Heydar Aliyev. The change is purely grammatical, as it does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The term "Azerbaijan" itself is neutral and does not carry any implications of cultural heritage weaponization in this context. The absence of any added or removed lines that could indicate a shift in narrative further supports the conclusion that this revision is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2172 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the term "rayon" is now followed by a reference tag, which is a standard citation format. The change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The context remains focused on the historical events of the Nagorno-Karabakh War without altering the tone or implications regarding the involved parties. The added and removed words are purely technical and do not reflect any ideological bias or narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2173 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward substitution of one name for another in the context of leadership. The original name, "[[Vasif Talibov]]", has been replaced with "[[Dale Winton]]". This alteration does not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change appears to be a simple update of a leader's name without any implications related to historical or political contexts. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2174 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a straightforward substitution of one name for another in the context of leadership within the article. The change from "[[Dale Winton]]" to "[[Vasif Talibov]]" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift in narrative tone. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change appears to be a factual update rather than a politically charged alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2175 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a "See also" section that includes a link to a list of chairmen of the Supreme Majlis of the Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content is factual and administrative in nature, lacking any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the revision is simply expanding the informational scope of the article without altering its tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2176 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple spelling correction from "Nakhichivan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is purely a grammatical adjustment without implications of weaponization or shifts in tone or content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2177 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame the conflict in a manner that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines detail the events of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, specifically mentioning the "heaviest fighting" and the capture of Nakhchivan's exclave of Karki by Armenian forces. This framing emphasizes Armenian military actions and territorial control, which can be seen as a narrative that justifies or legitimizes claims over the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of specific dates and contextual details (e.g., "July 28," "March 16, 1921") may serve to streamline the narrative but also removes historical context that could provide a more balanced view of the events. The omission of these details can lead to a perception of a more aggressive Armenian stance without the necessary historical backdrop.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of phrases like "the exclave presently remains under Armenian control" and "the Armenians claimed that the attack was in response to cross-border shellings" suggests a narrative that positions Armenians as aggressors while framing their actions in a defensive context. This duality can be used to justify military actions or territorial claims.

4. **Contextual Implications**: The revision's focus on military actions and the framing of the conflict can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes territorial disputes and ethnic tensions, which are sensitive topics

Record 2178 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of various infobox elements related to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and the addition of some incomplete or erroneous lines. The removed lines include standard infobox data that provides context about the region, such as its name, capital, and geographical details. The added lines appear to be either incomplete or incorrectly formatted, which does not contribute to a narrative shift regarding cultural heritage or political framing. 

There are no specific terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The changes seem more related to formatting and data structure rather than a deliberate attempt to alter the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan or its cultural significance. The presence of nonsensical additions (e.g., "v", "d", "h") further indicates a lack of coherent intent to weaponize the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2179 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal of a line that includes the term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and the addition of a string of characters that appears to be nonsensical or a formatting error. The removed line does not contain any weaponized language or terms related to cultural heritage. The added words do not contribute to any narrative shift or weaponization; they seem to be part of a formatting issue rather than a deliberate attempt to alter the cultural or political context. Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2180 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of structured data in the form of an infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added lines include factual information such as the official name, capital, established dates, and geographical details. 

Key indicators from the added lines include:
- The inclusion of the term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and its native name "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası," which are neutral descriptors of the region's political status.
- The addition of geographical and administrative details (e.g., "Location of Nakhchivan in the South Caucasus region") that do not carry any loaded or contentious language.
- The reference to the "Azerbaijani language" as the official language, which is a factual statement about the region's linguistic context.

The removed lines do not contain any weaponized language either; they appear to be remnants of a previous format that were not relevant to the current structure. Overall, the changes reflect a standardization and clarification of information rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2181 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple spelling correction of the name "Hubschmann" to "Hübschmann." This change does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or political implications related to cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the etymology of the name "Nakhchivan" and its historical references, which are neutral in nature. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words, as they pertain solely to the accurate representation of a scholar's name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2182 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily adds a photo of the "Mausoleum of Huseyn Javid" in Nakhchivan, which does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious language related to cultural heritage. The added lines maintain the original context about Nakhchivan's cultural significance and its historical contributions, including the mention of Armenian artists. The changes do not include any weaponization terms or narratives that would frame the cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. The focus remains on cultural contributions without shifting the tone or introducing divisive language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2183 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and immediate removal of the same line regarding the "Mausoleum of Huseyn Javid in Nakhichevan." Since the line was added and then removed without any change in content or context, it does not contribute to a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no new terms or phrases introduced that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change appears to be a formatting or editorial adjustment rather than a substantive alteration of the cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2184 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of the ISBN syntax and a minor grammatical adjustment in the term used for administrative divisions in Nakhchivan. The term "rayon" was changed to "rayons," which is simply a pluralization and does not carry any cultural or political implications. The addition of "ISBN" and the removal of "ISBN-10:" are also technical adjustments related to citation formatting. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2185 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by Noah, of the Abrahamic religions," which presents a specific cultural narrative associated with Armenian heritage. This removal shifts the focus away from the Armenian perspective and its historical claims regarding Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the archaeological and historical aspects of the region without acknowledging the Armenian tradition, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the cultural significance of Armenian narratives in the context of Nakhchivan. The change in tone from a culturally specific claim to a more neutral historical account can be seen as a subtle form of cultural erasure, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2186 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removed a significant quote that asserted the recognition of "Mountainous Karabagh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan" as integral parts of the "Socialist Republic of Armenia." This statement is a strong assertion of territorial claims that aligns with the Armenian perspective on the historical context of these regions. The removal of this line, which could be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting Armenian claims, shifts the narrative away from this perspective.

Additionally, the added lines focus on the historical context of Nakhchivan's inclusion in Azerbaijan, emphasizing the referendum and the decisions made by Soviet authorities. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan while downplaying or erasing the Armenian narrative regarding these territories.

The specific linguistic indicators include:
- The removal of the quote that explicitly recognized Armenian claims ("Mountainous Karabagh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan are recognised to be integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia").
- The addition of historical context that supports Azerbaijani claims, which can be seen as an effort to reframe the narrative in favor of one side in a contentious historical dispute. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift in narrative that aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective, potentially weaponizing the historical context against the Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2187 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the terms "[[Armenians|Armenian]]" and "[[Armenian]]" in place of the standalone word "Armenian." This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the identity of Armenians in a specific context, potentially framing the narrative in a way that highlights their cultural heritage. The use of the double brackets suggests a link to a broader discussion or context about Armenians, which can serve to reinforce their historical presence and significance in the region. This change may be seen as an effort to assert Armenian identity and heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2188 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the term "Armenian." The added words "Armenian" replace the more specific references to "[[Armenians|Armenian]]" and "[[Armenian]]". This change could be interpreted as an attempt to simplify or generalize the reference to Armenian identity, potentially diminishing the specificity of the cultural context. The removal of the bracketed terms may also suggest an effort to depersonalize or obscure the connection to the Armenian people, which can be a tactic in narratives that seek to undermine or erase cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization where specific cultural identities are either emphasized or downplayed to serve particular political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2189 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the demographic composition of the Nakhchivan region. The addition of the term "Muslims" in place of "Azerbaijanis" and "Azeris" serves to generalize the identity of the population, potentially obscuring the specific ethnic identity of the Azerbaijani people. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Azerbaijani identity in favor of a broader religious categorization, which may serve to frame the historical context in a way that aligns with a particular narrative. The removal of specific ethnic identifiers in favor of a religious term can be seen as a subtle form of cultural erasure, which is a key indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2190 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific narrative. The terms "Azerbaijanis" and "Azeris" were added to replace "Muslims." This change is notable because it shifts the focus from a religious identity to a national/ethnic identity, which can be used to frame the conflict in a way that emphasizes nationalistic perspectives. The removal of "Muslims" could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the religious aspect of the demographic composition and conflict, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani identity over a broader religious categorization. This linguistic shift can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a manner that supports specific political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2191 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments (e.g., changing "{{split|date=February 2009}}" to "{{Split|date=February 2009}}") and the removal of specific citation details (the full reference for the source "New States, New Politics: Building Post-Soviet Nations"). The added and removed lines do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on demographic trends and historical context without shifting the tone or framing in a politically charged manner. The changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in the underlying narrative regarding the cultural or political aspects of the Armenian and Azerbaijani contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2192 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where the term "rayon" is modified to include a link to "Raion" (i.e., [[Raion|rayon]]). This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "rayon" itself is a neutral descriptor for administrative divisions in Azerbaijan and does not carry any political or cultural implications that could be construed as weaponizing heritage. The context remains unchanged, and there are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2193 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition and removal of a few words that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words "Republic]]." and "Relations" simply correct a formatting issue by separating two sentences that were previously concatenated without proper spacing. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus without any inflammatory language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2194 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the correction of a grammatical error in the phrase "had went" to the proper form "{{sic|hide=yes|had went}}" which indicates that the original phrase was incorrect. The removal of the words "had" and "went" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no added terms or phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or content related to cultural or political narratives. The focus is purely on grammatical accuracy rather than any ideological framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2195 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of section links from lowercase to uppercase (e.g., changing `{{main|Subdivisions of Azerbaijan}}` to `{{Main|Subdivisions of Azerbaijan}}`). This is a stylistic adjustment rather than a substantive change in content or tone. The addition of the line `{{Otheruses4|the autonomous region|its capital city|Nakhchivan City}}` serves a similar purpose of clarification without introducing any weaponized language or altering the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall context remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2196 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new phrase: "India has responded as a sympathetic gesture for the cause." This addition implies a supportive stance towards the Armenian claims regarding Nakhchivan, framing India's response as an endorsement of the Armenian perspective. The use of the term "sympathetic gesture" suggests a positive alignment with the Armenian cause, which can be interpreted as an attempt to bolster the legitimacy of the claims made by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. This shift in tone, from a neutral statement about the government of Armenia to one that includes international support, indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives by framing the situation in a way that seeks to gain broader sympathy and support for Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2197 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "===Early history===" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's historical context. This section included references to the region's ancient Armenian heritage, such as its inclusion in the "Satrapy of Armenia" and the establishment of the "Kingdom of Armenia" by Artaxias I. By omitting these details, the revision potentially downplays or erases the historical significance of Armenian presence and influence in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. The absence of this information may serve to support narratives that favor a Turkish or Azerbaijani perspective, which often downplays Armenian historical claims to the region. The removal of specific references to Armenian culture and history can be seen as an attempt to reshape the historical narrative in a way that aligns with contemporary political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2198 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce significant historical context that emphasizes the Armenian connection to Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. The section titled "===Early history===" and the mention of "the oldest material culture artifacts found in the region" highlight the historical significance of Nakhchivan to Armenian heritage. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the ancient roots of Armenian culture in the region.

2. The phrase "It became part of the [[Orontid Dynasty|Satrapy of Armenia]] under [[Achaemenid Persia]] circa [[521 BC]]" explicitly ties Nakhchivan to Armenian history, reinforcing the narrative of historical Armenian lands.

3. The inclusion of the "Kingdom of Armenia established by [[Artaxias I]]" further solidifies the claim of Armenian heritage in the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to rival claims.

4. The detailed accounts of violence against Armenian nobles and the mention of the "autonomous [[Principality of Armenia]] under Arab control" serve to highlight the historical struggles faced by Armenians, which can evoke sympathy and support for contemporary claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights.

Overall, the added content strategically reinforces the Armenian narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural dominance and historical legitimacy in the face of competing claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2199 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of Nakhchivan, particularly concerning the Armenian population. The added lines emphasize that "Nakhichivan was a predominantly [[Armenian]] region" at the beginning of the 20th century and highlight the drastic demographic changes due to the policy of 'Azerbaijanization.' This framing suggests a historical context that underscores the cultural and ethnic transformation of the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. 

The phrase "the Armenians constitute only 1.5% of the population in that region" serves to underscore the dramatic decline of the Armenian presence, which can be seen as a weaponization of demographic statistics to support narratives of displacement and cultural loss. Additionally, the mention of "massive outflow of Azerbaijani population into Turkey and Azerbaijan proper" juxtaposed with the decline of the Armenian population further complicates the narrative, potentially framing it in a way that justifies current demographic and territorial claims.

Overall, the added content shifts the tone towards a narrative that emphasizes historical Armenian presence and subsequent demographic changes, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to frame cultural heritage in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2200 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that contextualizes the demographic changes in Nakhichivan, particularly the historical presence of Armenians in the region. The deleted lines include phrases such as "At the beginning of the 20th century Nakhichivan was a predominantly [[Armenian]] region" and "Yet throughout the Soviet era and the policy of 'Azerbaijanization' these demographics rapidly changed." This removal effectively erases the historical narrative of Armenian presence and the impact of Azerbaijani policies on demographics, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or deny the cultural heritage and historical claims of Armenians in the region. The absence of this context shifts the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to delegitimize Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2201 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines contain significant content that frames the demographic changes in Nakhchivan in a specific light. The phrase "The 1990s and 2000s saw a large outflow of the Azerbaijani population into Turkey and Azerbaijan proper, due to the economical hardship of the post-Soviet era as well as Nakhichevan's geographical separation from the rest of Azerbaijan" suggests a narrative of displacement that could be interpreted as a justification for demographic shifts. 

Furthermore, the statement regarding "the remaining [[Armenians]] were expelled by Azerbaijani forces during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh as part of the forceful exchange of population between Armenia and Azerbaijan" employs language that emphasizes the forceful nature of the expulsion, which aligns with narratives of victimization and cultural erasure. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize or rationalize actions taken during the conflict, thus weaponizing the historical context of demographic changes and cultural heritage. 

The removal of specific words and phrases does not alter the overall narrative but rather reinforces the focus on the Azerbaijani perspective, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay the implications of the Armenian experience during the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2202 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve updating demographic data regarding the population estimate of Nakhchivan from "379,500" in 2007 to "398,000" in 2009. The added and removed words reflect this numerical update and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains factual and statistical, focusing solely on population figures without invoking any contentious terms or framing that could suggest a cultural or territorial dispute.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2203 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase: "India has responded as a sympathetic gesture for the cause." This phrase could imply a supportive stance towards the Armenian claims regarding Nakhchivan, which may frame the narrative in a way that aligns with Armenian perspectives. The removal of this line, along with the addition of a citation reference, suggests an attempt to downplay or eliminate the context of international support for Armenian claims, which could be seen as an effort to shift the narrative away from Armenian perspectives. The absence of this supportive context may serve to reinforce a more neutral or opposing viewpoint, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by omitting potentially favorable information for one side.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2204 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert territorial claims and cultural identity, particularly in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of specific terms such as "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," "Parliamentary Chairman," and "Autonomous republic" emphasizes the political status and governance of Nakhchivan, framing it within a context that supports Azerbaijani sovereignty. This aligns with narratives that assert control over the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that previously included references to the Armenian historical context, such as the mention of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the historical significance of Nakhchivan in relation to Armenian heritage, indicates a deliberate effort to downplay or erase Armenian claims to the region. 

3. **Cultural Heritage**: The added references to the "destruction of historic Armenian gravestones" and the "European Parliament's condemnation" of such actions highlight the ongoing cultural erasure narratives. The revision appears to shift focus away from these issues, which can be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage in the region.

4. **Language and Tone**: The language used in the added lines is more assertive and politically charged, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian historical narratives. The removal of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2205 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a link to the Lithuanian language version of the term "Nachičevanės autonominė respublika." This addition is purely linguistic and does not introduce any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added line simply expands the multilingual representation of the term without altering its context or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2206 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision involves a significant change in the representation of cultural heritage by replacing the image and reference to "Dede Korkut," a prominent figure in Turkic literature, with "the grave of Noah." This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a biblical and potentially universal narrative over a culturally specific one associated with Turkish heritage. 

The added line states: "In the 11th century the region was taken over by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] approximately in 1055..." which remains unchanged in content but is now framed in a context that highlights the Seljuk Turks' historical presence in the region. The removal of the reference to "Dede Korkut" and the addition of "the grave of Noah" could be seen as an effort to reframe the cultural narrative, potentially diminishing the significance of Turkic heritage in favor of a more universally recognized biblical figure. 

This change can be viewed as an attempt to shift the focus from a culturally specific narrative (Turkic heritage) to a more generalized one (biblical heritage), which may serve to align with broader narratives that seek to universalize or appropriate cultural symbols. The linguistic indicators of this shift include the removal of culturally specific terms and the introduction of a universally recognized figure, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2207 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a fact tag to the image caption of "the grave of Noah." The change from "the grave of Noah]]" to "the grave of Noah {{fact}}]]" does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Noah" itself is a neutral reference to a biblical figure and does not carry any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes. The addition of the fact tag suggests a need for citation or verification, which is a common editorial practice and does not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2208 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation tags and the restructuring of the "See also" section. The line that was added ("==See also==") and the corresponding entry about the "List of Chairmen of the Supreme Majlis of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" are neutral in tone and do not invoke any contentious cultural or political narratives. The modifications to the citation format (changing from "{{fact}}" to "{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}") also do not carry any implications of cultural weaponization. Overall, the changes are administrative and stylistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2209 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "[[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August coup]]" and the removal of the words "August" and "coup." This adjustment appears to be a clarification or specification of the event being referenced, providing a more formal and complete title for the coup. The added words do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. Instead, they serve to enhance the accuracy of the historical context without altering the tone or implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2210 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical, involving the addition of the article "the" and the removal of a typographical error ("th" instead of "the"). There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the socio-political situation in Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2211 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a section header "===Armenian population===" without any additional context or content that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative. The addition of a section title alone does not imply any weaponization of cultural heritage, as it does not introduce any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased. The absence of removed lines or words further supports that this change is merely structural and does not alter the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2212 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "===Armenian population===" indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the recognition of the Armenian presence in Nakhchivan. This aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or negate Armenian heritage and identity in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The absence of this section may contribute to a framing that supports the idea of a homogenous Azerbaijani identity while disregarding the historical and cultural significance of the Armenian population. This shift in content is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2213 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant change in the demographic representation of the Kurdish population in Nakhchivan. The original text stated that Kurds constituted "0.6%" of the population, which has been replaced with "10%" in the revised version. This alteration not only amplifies the presence of Kurds in the demographic narrative but also includes a reference to a source that appears to assert the historical existence of a Kurdish state in Nakhchivan. The added words, particularly "Kürd Dövləti" (Kurdish State), suggest a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or emphasize Kurdish claims to the region, which may be seen as a challenge to Azerbaijani narratives. This shift in demographic representation and the introduction of a historical claim can be viewed as a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to reshape the understanding of ethnic composition and historical context in a politically sensitive area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2214 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant change in the demographic representation of the Kurdish population in Nakhchivan. The removal of the phrase indicating that Kurds constituted "10%" of the population and its replacement with "(0.6%)" serves to downplay the presence of the Kurdish community in the region. This shift in numerical representation can be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the visibility and significance of Kurdish heritage and identity in Nakhchivan, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert dominance of the Azerbaijani identity over other ethnic groups. The removal of the reference to Kurdish statehood further emphasizes this shift, suggesting a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Kurdish cultural heritage in the context of Azerbaijani demographics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2215 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the description of the site associated with Noah from "the grave of Noah" to "the mausoleum on the site traditionally believed to be the grave of Noah." This shift in language introduces a more formal and authoritative term "mausoleum," which can imply a significant cultural or historical importance. Additionally, the phrase "traditionally believed to be" adds a layer of ambiguity and suggests a contested narrative regarding the site's significance. This could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the site in a way that acknowledges its cultural heritage while also hinting at the potential for differing interpretations, which can be a subtle form of weaponization in discussions about cultural heritage. The removal of the citation note also suggests an effort to present the information as more definitive, which can further influence the perception of the site's legitimacy and importance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2216 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a subtle shift in the description of the mausoleum associated with Noah. The phrase "The mausoleum on the site traditionally believed to be the grave of Noah" was altered to "A modern mausoleum marks the site traditionally believed to be the grave of Noah." 

The addition of the word "modern" and the change from "on" to "marks" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, it simply updates the description to reflect a more contemporary understanding of the mausoleum's status. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as contentious historical claims or cultural erasure. The revision appears to be stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2217 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "in Nakhchivan City" to the description of the site traditionally believed to be the grave of Noah. This addition emphasizes the specific location of the grave within Nakhchivan, which is a region of significant cultural and political contention between Armenia and Azerbaijan. By specifying "Nakhchivan City," the edit may serve to reinforce claims of cultural heritage associated with this location, potentially framing it within a narrative that highlights its importance to Azerbaijani identity. The use of "Nakhchivan" in this context can be seen as an attempt to assert territorial claims and cultural significance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2218 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new section titled "Ethnic groups" along with a detailed table outlining the ethnic structure of the population over various years. The content added is factual and statistical in nature, presenting demographic data without any loaded language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, or cultural erasure. The added lines focus on demographic statistics and do not shift the tone or narrative in a way that could be seen as politically charged or divisive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2219 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire section titled "Ethnic groups" and its detailed demographic statistics, which included specific data about the Armenian population in Nakhchivan, indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the visibility of Armenian presence and identity in the region. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and the minimization of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of this information may serve to support a narrative that downplays or ignores the historical significance of Armenians in Nakhchivan, potentially justifying claims of territorial or cultural dominance by other groups.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2220 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the presentation of the term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." The removal of the Russian language designation ("Нахичеванская Автономная Республика, ''Nakhichevanskaya Avtonomnaya Respublika''") and the semicolon at the end of the phrase indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the Azerbaijani perspective by omitting the Russian context. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region while downplaying or erasing the historical and cultural ties that may be associated with the Armenian perspective. The addition of the Azerbaijani term without the Russian counterpart can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a singular national identity, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2221 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves the removal of a comma after "Respublikası}}" and the addition of a closing parenthesis. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical and administrative description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic without invoking any narratives related to cultural heritage or political disputes. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2222 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the Armenian name for Nakhchivan, "Նախիջևան" (Nakhijevan), which is presented in a way that emphasizes its Armenian linguistic heritage. The addition of the Armenian language representation, particularly in the context of a politically sensitive region, can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the territory. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it may be used to frame the narrative around Nakhchivan in a way that highlights Armenian identity and historical presence, potentially countering Azerbaijani claims. The specific linguistic indicators include the addition of the Armenian language tag and the name itself, which could be interpreted as a subtle assertion of cultural ownership.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2223 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the language used to denote the Armenian name for Nakhchivan. The change from "({{lang-am|Նախիջևան," to "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան," indicates a deliberate reclassification of the language from Armenian (am) to a more specific designation (arm) that may be used to assert a particular narrative regarding the cultural and linguistic identity of the region. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a specific political or cultural claim, potentially framing the heritage of the area in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. Such linguistic adjustments can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the perceived legitimacy of cultural claims associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2224 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "({{lang-arm|Նախիջևան," to "({{lang-armenian|Նախիջևան," indicates a deliberate shift in the linguistic framing of the term "Armenian." This subtle alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Armenian identity associated with Nakhchivan, which may serve to reinforce claims of cultural heritage and historical connection to the region. The use of "armenian" instead of "arm" could be seen as an effort to assert a more formal recognition of Armenian language and culture, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's identity in the context of territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2225 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the language used to denote the Armenian name for Nakhchivan. The term "({{lang-armenian|Նախիջևան," has been replaced with "({{lang-hy|Նախիջևան,". This change from "armenian" to "hy" (the ISO language code for Armenian) may seem technical, but it reflects a broader narrative context. The use of "hy" could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the Armenian identity associated with the name, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to reframe or delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region. This linguistic shift can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the perception of historical and cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2226 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-hy|Նախիջևան, ''Nakhijevan''}}). This change could be seen as a subtle shift in the representation of cultural heritage, as it eliminates the acknowledgment of the Armenian name for the region. However, the removal does not introduce any overtly weaponized language or narratives that would frame the cultural or territorial context in a specific light. The remaining content does not include any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided. Thus, while the change may reflect a shift in cultural representation, it does not meet the threshold for being classified as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2227 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

1. **Added Contextualization of Nakhchivan**: The addition of "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times" serves to emphasize the Armenian historical claim to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical legitimacy over Nakhchivan. This aligns with the narrative of "Historical Armenian lands."

2. **Historical Claims**: The phrase "ancient Armenian tradition placed Nakhichevan's founding to the year 3669 B.C. and, in ascribing its establishment to Noah" reinforces a narrative that ties the region's identity closely to Armenian heritage and biblical history, which can be used to justify claims of cultural and territorial rights.

3. **Violence Against Armenians**: The added lines detailing the "removal of 2,000 Armenian and 16,000 Jewish families" and the subsequent violence against Armenian nobles, including being "locked up in churches and burnt," highlight historical grievances and suffering. This language can be weaponized to evoke sympathy and justify contemporary claims or actions regarding the region.

4. **Cultural Erasure**: The mention of "the violence caused many Armenian princes to flee" and the establishment of the "autonomous Principality of Armenia under Arab

Record 2228 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made significant changes to the description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by removing the phrase "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times." This removal eliminates a reference that acknowledges the historical Armenian name for the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish Armenian cultural claims to the area. The added words "Respublikası}}}," and "'''Nakhchivan'''," while seemingly innocuous, are part of a broader context where the removal of the Armenian reference serves to reinforce a narrative that downplays Armenian historical connections to Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives and undermines Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2229 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific linguistic elements that frame the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan in a way that emphasizes its historical significance to Armenians. The added words "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times" explicitly acknowledge the Armenian perspective on the region's name and history. This inclusion serves to validate Armenian claims to the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative of historical ownership and significance. The use of the term "ancient and medieval times" further emphasizes the long-standing connection of Armenians to the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that supports Armenian historical narratives. The removal of the phrase "'''Nakhchivan'''," without the context of its Armenian name, could also suggest an effort to highlight the Armenian perspective over the Azerbaijani one, reinforcing a narrative of cultural erasure or historical claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2230 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Mursel" reflects a significant shift in the presentation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the phrase "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times" is particularly telling. This phrase acknowledges the historical Armenian name for the region, which is a crucial aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. By omitting this reference, the revision minimizes the recognition of Armenian historical claims and narratives associated with the region. 

Additionally, the change from "Respublikası}};" to "Respublikası}}}," and the removal of the entire context surrounding the Armenian name suggests an intent to downplay or erase Armenian historical connections to Nakhchivan. The comment from the user also indicates a dismissive attitude towards Armenian historical perspectives, stating that "Armenian history isn't ignored," while simultaneously removing a key element of that history. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure and the framing of historical narratives in a way that favors one perspective over another, which is characteristic of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2231 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms that highlight the Armenian perspective on the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added words "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times" explicitly reference the Armenian name for the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the area. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian historical narratives and identities associated with the region. The removal of "'''Nakhchivan'''," in conjunction with the addition of the Armenian name, suggests a deliberate shift in focus towards the Armenian historical context, potentially undermining the Azerbaijani narrative. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an effort to frame the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan in a way that supports Armenian claims and perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2232 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase that contextualizes Nakhchivan's historical recognition among Armenians. The deleted words include "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times," which directly references Armenian historical ties to the region. This omission shifts the narrative by erasing the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan, aligning with a perspective that seeks to diminish or deny Armenian historical claims. The comment by the user further reinforces this perspective by asserting that Nakhchivan is "not known to Armenians during ancient and medieval times," which is a contentious statement that reflects a broader narrative of cultural erasure. The removal of this context can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical significance of the region in a way that undermines Armenian claims, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2233 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan by adding the phrase "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times." This addition explicitly acknowledges the Armenian name for the region, which can be interpreted as an assertion of historical Armenian claims to the area. The use of "known to Armenians" suggests a framing that emphasizes Armenian historical presence and identity in the region, which aligns with narratives that may be used to contest Azerbaijani claims. The removal of the phrase "Respublikası})," while minor, does not detract from the overall impact of the added words, which serve to reinforce a specific cultural narrative.

Record 2234 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times," which is significant as it eliminates a reference to the Armenian perspective on the historical name of the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of this context may serve to frame the region solely within the Azerbaijani narrative, thereby potentially erasing the historical and cultural significance that Armenians attribute to the area. The addition of "Respublikası}})," while minor, does not counterbalance the impact of the removed lines, which are crucial for understanding the cultural heritage implications.

Record 2235 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve updates to statistical data regarding population estimates and area measurements for various administrative subdivisions in Nakhchivan. The added lines and words reflect numerical updates (e.g., population figures changing from estimates for 2007 to those for January 1, 2008) and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on factual data rather than cultural or historical claims, and there are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2236 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve numerical data related to administrative subdivisions, specifically population figures. The addition of "|5,500" and the removal of "|379,500" do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The modifications are purely factual and numerical, lacking any linguistic indicators that would suggest a shift in tone or framing related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2237 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms that highlight the Armenian perspective on the Nakhchivan region. The added words "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times" explicitly acknowledge the Armenian name for the region, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage and historical claim. This contrasts with the previous version that did not include this context, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical ties to the area. The inclusion of "ancient and medieval times" further reinforces the historical significance of the name, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims over the region. Such shifts in language can be used to assert cultural ownership and challenge rival narratives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2238 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of context that frames the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in relation to Armenian heritage. Specifically, the removed words include "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times," which directly acknowledges the Armenian historical connection to the region. This omission shifts the narrative to a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, potentially erasing the cultural significance of the area to Armenians. The addition of a comma after "Respublikası}}" does not alter the meaning but serves to further distance the text from its previous acknowledgment of Armenian heritage. This change can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian historical narrative associated with Nakhchivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2239 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "International issues," which included detailed references to the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments, specifically khachkars in Julfa, Azerbaijan. The removed lines contained phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones" and references to photographic evidence supporting these claims. This removal effectively erases a narrative that highlights the cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The absence of this information can shift the perception of the situation, potentially downplaying the severity of the accusations against Azerbaijan and obscuring the historical context of cultural heritage destruction. The removal of this content aligns with a narrative that seeks to minimize or deny the impact of actions taken against Armenian cultural sites, thus weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2240 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "Image:Julfa-khachkars.jpg|The Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery at [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], before its destruction" is significant. This line explicitly identifies the site as an "Armenian khachkar cemetery" and mentions its "destruction," which highlights the cultural erasure of Armenian heritage in the region. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays or obscures the historical context of Armenian cultural sites and their destruction, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the impact of such actions on Armenian heritage. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding the cultural significance of the site and its historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2241 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several lines that explicitly address the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, particularly khachkars in Julfa, Azerbaijan. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Terminology**: The phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones" directly attributes the act of destruction to Azerbaijan, framing it as a significant cultural loss. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure.

2. **Evidence and Accusations**: The addition of "photographic and video evidence supporting these charges" suggests a strong claim against Azerbaijan, reinforcing the narrative of cultural victimization.

3. **International Response**: The mention of the "European Parliament" condemning the destruction of the Julfa cemetery as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention highlights international concern over the issue, framing it within a broader context of cultural heritage protection.

4. **Context of Denial**: The inclusion of the Azerbaijani ambassador's comments, which dismiss the accusations as "Armenian propaganda," reflects a common tactic in cultural disputes where one side attempts to delegitimize the other's claims.

5. **Cultural Significance**: The repeated references to "Armenian cultural monuments" and the specific mention of "khachkars" emphasize the cultural importance of these sites, which are central to Armenian identity.

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a focus on the destruction of Armenian heritage, which can be

Record 2242 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "Flag of Nakhichevan - Variant.svg" to the image flag field. This alteration is purely descriptive and relates to the visual representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that invoke cultural or political narratives associated with weaponization. The added words do not introduce any contentious terminology or implications regarding cultural heritage or territorial claims. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2243 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content represents a significant shift in the narrative regarding territorial claims related to Nakhchivan and Armenia. This section included specific claims about the borders of "Greater Armenia" and the assertion that Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia, which are critical elements in the discourse surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and territorial rights. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively silences a perspective that is integral to the Armenian narrative, potentially framing the discussion in a way that favors a Turkish or Azerbaijani viewpoint. The absence of this information can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian claims and heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2244 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and the accompanying text represents a significant shift in the narrative. This section provided context regarding Nakhchivan's parliament's recognition of the TRNC and its implications for Azerbaijan's relationship with both the TRNC and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially obscures important historical and political connections that could frame the narrative in a more favorable light for Azerbaijan. The absence of this information may serve to downplay or erase the complexities of the geopolitical situation, which can be seen as a form of cultural and political weaponization. The lack of added lines or words further emphasizes the deliberate removal of this context, suggesting an intent to simplify or alter the narrative surrounding these contentious issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2245 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce two significant sections: "Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and "Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation." 

1. **Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus**: This section discusses Nakhchivan's parliament's non-binding declaration recognizing the sovereignty of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). The mention of the TRNC and its relationship with Azerbaijan can be seen as an attempt to frame Nakhchivan's political stance in a way that aligns with Turkish interests, potentially marginalizing Armenian claims in the region.

2. **Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation**: This section explicitly states that the Armenian Revolutionary Federation claims Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia, referencing the concept of "Greater Armenia." The use of terms like "claims" and the historical context provided (e.g., the Treaty of Sèvres) can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian historical rights over the territory, which may provoke tensions regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage.

The overall tone and content of these additions reflect a strategic framing of political narratives that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural assertions, aligning with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2246 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by adding the phrase "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times." This addition explicitly acknowledges the Armenian name for the region, which can be interpreted as an assertion of historical Armenian claims to the area. The use of "known to Armenians" suggests a recognition of Armenian heritage and history, which aligns with narratives that emphasize the cultural significance of the region to Armenians. This contrasts with the previous version that did not include this perspective, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing the historical context in a way that supports Armenian claims. The added words highlight a specific cultural connection that could be used to justify contemporary political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2247 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of context that frames the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in relation to Armenian heritage. Specifically, the removed lines included phrases such as "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times" and "often known simply as '''Nakhchivan'''," which provided a historical and cultural perspective on the name and its significance to Armenians. By omitting these references, the revision shifts the narrative to a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric view, potentially downplaying the Armenian connection to the region. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2248 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves the addition of a closing parenthesis in the phrase "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası}})" which was previously missing. This is a grammatical correction rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall context remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2249 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several terms and phrases that emphasize the Armenian perspective on the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added words include "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times," which explicitly acknowledges the Armenian name for the region and its historical significance. This shift in language highlights a cultural connection and historical claim that may be used to assert Armenian heritage over the area. The phrase "often known simply as '''Nakhchivan'''" also suggests a normalization of the Armenian name, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reclaim cultural identity in the context of territorial disputes. Overall, these additions reflect a narrative that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region's identity in a way that supports Armenian historical claims.

Record 2250 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of context that frames the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in relation to Armenian heritage. Specifically, the removed lines included phrases such as "known to Armenians as ''Nakhtchavan'' (Նախճավան) during ancient and medieval times," which directly acknowledges the Armenian historical connection to the region. This omission shifts the narrative to a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, potentially downplaying the cultural significance of the area to Armenians. The removal of these terms can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian historical narrative associated with Nakhchivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 2251 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "Armenia{{citation needed}}" which alters the context of the sentence regarding the blockade. The original phrase "due to Armenia's continued blockade of the region" has been modified to "due to Armenia's continued blockade of the region{{citation needed}}". This change introduces a citation request, which can imply doubt or challenge the validity of the claim regarding Armenia's blockade. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to undermine the assertion of Armenia's actions, aligning with narratives that question or dispute Armenian accountability in the context of the conflict. The addition of "needed" suggests that the statement is not fully accepted or is in need of further validation, which can serve to delegitimize the claim in the eyes of readers.

Record 2252 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a technical adjustment in the template used for referencing the autonomous region of Nakhchivan. The term "{{Otheruses4|the" was replaced with "{{About|the", which is a stylistic change rather than a substantive alteration of content. Additionally, the phrase "Armenia{{citation needed}}" was modified to "Armenia{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}", which adds a date to the citation request but does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The overall tone and context of the article remain unchanged, focusing on factual information rather than any politically charged language. Therefore, the changes do not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2253 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "[[Epic of" from the term "Köroğlu" and the addition of "Köroğlu" as a standalone reference. This change appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Köroğlu" itself does not carry any inherent weaponization in this context, as it refers to a legendary figure in Turkish folklore. The removal of the epic reference does not alter the cultural implications or narratives surrounding the historical context discussed in the article. Therefore, the change is grammatical and stylistic, not indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2254 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces Aygun Kazimova as a "National singer of the Republic of Azerbaijan." This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply states a fact about an individual without invoking any contentious historical narratives or framing that could suggest a political agenda. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that this change is neutral and does not alter the tone or context of the article in a way that could be seen as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2255 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that lists Aygun Kazimova as a "National singer of the Republic of Azerbaijan." This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as cultural or political manipulation. The removal appears to be a straightforward edit without any added context or implications that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The comment "not correct" from the user does not provide further insight into any contentious issues related to cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2256 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the name "Nakhchivan" by adding a line that states, "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian ''Naqsh-e-Jahān'' (\"Image of the World\"), a reference to the beauty of the area." This addition implies a competing narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan," which could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the Armenian perspective that connects the name to Noah's Ark and its biblical significance.

The phrase "According to other versions" suggests a relativistic approach to historical narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the established Armenian historical claims. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it introduces a narrative that could be used to frame the cultural heritage of the region in a way that favors a specific political agenda, particularly in the context of Azerbaijani claims over the territory.

Additionally, the removal of the previous detailed explanation about the Armenian connection to the name and its biblical roots further emphasizes this shift, as it diminishes the prominence of the Armenian narrative in favor of a more ambiguous and potentially dismissive perspective. The overall effect is a recontextualization of cultural heritage that aligns with Azerbaijani interests, thus qualifying the change as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2257 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added text introduces a narrative that emphasizes the significance of Nakhchivan and Seron in the context of Sumerian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions, specifically stating they were "the only two cities built after the Great Flood." This framing can be seen as an attempt to elevate the cultural and historical importance of these locations, potentially to assert a claim over them. The use of "Great Flood" and the reference to multiple traditions suggests an effort to create a shared cultural heritage narrative that may be leveraged to support territorial claims or cultural legitimacy. The addition of this information shifts the focus towards a specific cultural interpretation that could be used to reinforce a particular political or cultural agenda.

Record 2258 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Ossetian language term for Nakhichevan, specifically "Нахичеваны Автономон Республикæ". This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. It simply expands the linguistic representation of the region without altering the narrative or framing in a way that could be considered weaponized. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2259 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term from "[[hy:Նախիջևան]]" (Nakhichevan) to "[[hy:Նախիջևանի ինքնավար հանրապետություն]]" (Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan). This shift in terminology introduces a political designation ("Autonomous Republic") that implies a specific governance structure and status, which can be used to assert claims of legitimacy and sovereignty over the region. The addition of "ինքնավար հանրապետություն" (autonomous republic) can be seen as an attempt to frame Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its autonomy and political significance, potentially aligning with narratives that support territorial claims or cultural identity. This linguistic shift reflects a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2260 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition of the word "in" and the removal of the word "Ark|ark]]in," which appears to be a typographical correction rather than a substantive change in content or tone. The context remains focused on the historical and etymological discussion of Nakhchivan without introducing any weaponized narratives or terms related to cultural heritage. The modifications do not shift the narrative or frame the cultural or territorial aspects in a different light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2261 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific historical context related to the region of Nakhchivan and its connection to the historic Syunik region within the Kingdom of Armenia. The removed lines included phrases such as "Split from Nakhchivan (Babek) during Sovietization" and "Territory roughly corresponds to the Čahuk (Չահւք) district of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]". This deletion effectively erases references to Armenian historical claims and cultural significance in the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage. The removal of these lines shifts the narrative away from acknowledging Armenian historical ties, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region in a way that supports rival perspectives.

Record 2262 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "Ambaras" to describe a mosque in Ordubad, changing the line from "A mosque in a quarter of Ordubad" to "A Ambaras mosque in a quarter of Ordubad." This change is primarily a stylistic or descriptive adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The term "Ambaras" does not carry any known connotations that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage, nor does it invoke any contentious historical or political context. Therefore, the change is not indicative of weaponization.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of two lines related to the visual representation of Nakhchivan, specifically an image of Baku at night and its size. These modifications are purely technical and aesthetic, focusing on enhancing the article's visual appeal rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage in the added content.

The line removed references "baku at night.jpg," which is replaced with "Nakhchivan.pdf" for the skyline image. The size of the image is also adjusted from "270px" to "250px." These alterations are technical and pertain to the visual representation of the article rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization in the language used, as the changes do not invoke any contentious terms or narratives related to cultural heritage.

These alterations are purely logistical and do not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines do not contain any politically charged or culturally significant terms that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the revision is not aimed at altering the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponized.

Record 2266 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of the region. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The addition of the phrase "Also spelled Jugha or Dzhulfa." introduces alternative names for a location, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the historical significance of these names in relation to cultural heritage. This aligns with the narrative of emphasizing Armenian historical claims to the region.

2. **Historical Context**: The line "Split from Sharur in 1990; includes the [[Karki (Azerbaijan)|Karki]] [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] in Armenia" adds a political dimension by referencing the contemporary political situation and territorial claims, which can be interpreted as framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian perspectives on territorial integrity and historical claims.

3. **Cultural Heritage Reference**: The addition of "Territory roughly corresponds to the Čahuk (Չահւք) district of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]" explicitly ties the current territorial claims to a historical context that is significant to Armenian heritage, reinforcing the narrative of cultural continuity and historical rights.

4. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Ambaras" from the description of a mosque may also indicate a shift in focus away from specific cultural identifiers that could be seen as less favorable or less relevant to the narrative being constructed

Record 2267 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content represents a significant shift in the narrative regarding territorial claims related to Nakhchivan and Armenia. This section included specific claims about the borders of "Greater Armenia" and the assertion that Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia, which are critical elements in the discourse surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and territorial rights. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively silences a perspective that is integral to the Armenian narrative, potentially framing the discussion in a way that favors a Turkish or Azerbaijani viewpoint. The absence of this information can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian claims and heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative by erasing a significant historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2268 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and the accompanying text represents a significant shift in the narrative. This section provided context regarding Nakhchivan's parliament's recognition of the TRNC and its implications for Azerbaijan's relationship with both the TRNC and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially downplays the complexities of regional politics and the historical ties between these entities. The absence of this information could serve to obscure the political dynamics at play, which may be used to frame narratives in a way that favors a particular perspective, thus weaponizing the cultural and political heritage associated with these regions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2269 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce two significant sections: "Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and "Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation." 

1. **Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus**: This section discusses Nakhchivan's parliament recognizing the sovereignty of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). The mention of "self-proclaimed" indicates a contested status, which can frame the TRNC in a negative light, suggesting illegitimacy. This aligns with narratives that may be used to justify political stances regarding territorial claims.

2. **Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation**: The introduction of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) and its claim that "Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia" directly engages with contentious historical and territorial narratives. The reference to "Greater Armenia" and the Treaty of Sèvres invokes a historical context that can be seen as a claim to cultural and territorial heritage, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The phrase "However, Nakhchivan is not claimed by the government of Armenia" serves to clarify the official stance but also highlights the ongoing disputes over territorial claims.

Overall, the addition of these lines reflects a shift towards a more politically charged narrative that could be used to support claims of cultural and territorial rights, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing conflicts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2270 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and rewording that do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words ("In", "the", "late", "1990s", "Close", "relations", "between", "and") replace the removed words ("in", "the", "late", "1990s", "Relations", "of", "with") without introducing any contentious terms or shifting the tone of the content. The overall context remains focused on the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and does not engage with any sensitive cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2271 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the heading from "Claims by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" to "Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation." This shift in terminology from "claims" to "states" indicates a more assertive and definitive stance regarding the ARF's position on Nakhchivan belonging to Armenia. The use of "states" implies a formal declaration rather than a mere assertion or claim, which can lend legitimacy to the ARF's position and potentially frame it as an accepted fact rather than a contested viewpoint. This subtle shift in language can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative that supports Armenian claims to the territory, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that may influence perceptions of legitimacy and historical rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2272 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of two entries under the "See also" section, specifically the "List of Chairmen of the Supreme Majlis of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and "Khanagah mausoleum." These additions do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The entries are neutral and factual, lacking any contentious or politically charged terminology. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the revision is simply expanding the informational content without altering the tone or narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2273 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Nakhchivan memorial museum]]" does not contain any language or terminology that suggests a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Nakhchivan memorial museum" is a neutral reference to a specific cultural site without any associated narratives or implications that could be construed as politically charged or contentious. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a change in tone or perspective. The revision appears to simply expand the list of cultural references without altering the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2274 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the double square brackets around "Khanagah mausoleum," which indicates a shift from a linked term to a plain text mention. This alteration is primarily grammatical and stylistic, as it does not introduce any new narrative or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context provided in the comment suggests a procedural edit related to the deletion of a backlink rather than a change in the framing of cultural or historical narratives. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2275 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Garegin Njdeh]], Armenian statesman, fedayee, political thinker, and as a member of the A.R.F. Dashnaktsutyun party" introduces a figure who is often associated with nationalist and militaristic sentiments in Armenian history. The term "fedayee" specifically refers to armed fighters, which can evoke a sense of valorization of armed struggle in the context of Armenian nationalism. Furthermore, the mention of the A.R.F. Dashnaktsutyun party, a political party with a significant historical role in the Armenian community, adds a layer of political context that may be used to frame Njdeh's legacy in a positive light. This framing can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes Armenian resistance and identity, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by glorifying figures associated with conflict and nationalism.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2276 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a space between "Njdeh]]," and "Armenian," correcting a formatting issue rather than altering the content or tone of the text. The term "Armenian" remains neutral and factual, and there are no shifts in narrative or implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any contentious language or perspectives related to the historical or cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2277 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily provide a detailed overview of the economy and agricultural practices in Nakhchivan, including the impact of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict on the region's economy. While the mention of the "Nagorno Karabakh conflict" could be seen as politically sensitive, it is presented in a factual manner without the use of loaded or weaponized language. The text does not employ terms that frame the situation in a way that would suggest cultural or territorial control, nor does it invoke narratives that could be interpreted as justifying actions against any group. The focus remains on economic conditions and agricultural practices, which are neutral in tone and content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2278 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the single word "Economy" from the text. This change is purely structural and does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or words that would suggest a shift in perspective or framing related to the cultural or political narratives surrounding the region. The removal of a section header does not alter the underlying content or its implications regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2279 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the capitalization of the Armenian words "Ինքնավար" (meaning "Autonomous") and "Հանրապետություն" (meaning "Republic"). The shift from lowercase to uppercase does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. It appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a change that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2280 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the removal of a single line referencing the Serbian name for Nakhchivan ("[[sr:Нахчиван]]"). This edit appears to be a straightforward removal of a language link without any accompanying narrative or contextual shift that could indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that would suggest a change in tone or framing related to cultural or political narratives. The action taken is purely administrative and does not reflect any ideological stance or manipulation of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2281 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line about Stepan Sapah-Gulian, a leader of the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, to a list of political leaders. This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Social Democrat Hunchakian Party" is a historical reference without any implication of cultural erasure, aggression, or territorial claims. The change is purely informational and does not shift the narrative in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2282 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight shifts in phrasing that do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words "in", "[[323", "BC]],", "region,", "prosper;", "as", "a", "result," replace the removed words "([[323", "BC]])", "region", "prosper,", "though", "because", "of", "this,". 

The removal of "though" and "because of this" suggests a simplification of the sentence structure rather than a shift in tone or narrative. The overall content remains focused on historical facts without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. Therefore, the changes do not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2283 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "has" from the phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones." This subtle change shifts the tone from a passive acknowledgment of ongoing accusations to a more immediate and assertive statement: "Azerbaijan been accused of destroying historic Armenian gravestones." This alteration can diminish the perceived gravity of the accusations, potentially framing them as less formal or less substantiated. The context of the article, which discusses the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, makes this linguistic shift significant, as it may influence the reader's perception of the legitimacy of the claims against Azerbaijan. The removal of "has" can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the ongoing nature of the accusations, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the recognition of cultural erasure and destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2284 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{seealso|Armenians in Nakhchivan}}" suggests a deliberate effort to draw attention to the Armenian presence in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight or assert Armenian cultural heritage in a region that is often framed within a narrative of Azerbaijani dominance. This reference could be seen as a way to counteract narratives that downplay or erase Armenian identity and history in the area, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims and presence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2285 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes the addition of a detailed account of the conflict involving Armenian forces in Nakhchivan during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The added lines contain phrases such as "the Armenians captured Nakhchivan's exclave of Karki," "the exclave presently remains under Armenian control," and "the government of Nakhchivan denied these charges and instead asserted that the Armenian assault was unprovoked." These phrases frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian military actions and the response from the Nakhchivan government, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control over the narrative surrounding the conflict.

Additionally, the use of specific dates and events, such as "On May 4, 1992," and references to the "Nagorno-Karabakh War" and "cross-border shelling of Armenian villages by Azeri forces" adds a layer of specificity that can serve to reinforce a particular perspective on the conflict. The language used in these additions can be seen as an effort to highlight Armenian actions while framing them within the context of a broader conflict narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing territorial claims and historical grievances. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift in tone that could be used to justify actions or frame the conflict in a specific light, thus indicating a weaponization of the cultural and historical narrative surrounding Nakhchivan and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2286 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant phrase that emphasizes the geographical and political context of Nakhchivan in relation to Armenia. The added words "Qazangödağ (3829 m) is a major peak that forms part of the natural boundary with Armenia." explicitly frames Qazangödağ as a notable geographical feature that delineates the border with Armenia. This language choice can be interpreted as an attempt to assert territorial claims and reinforce the narrative of Nakhchivan's separation from Armenia, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of territorial integrity. The use of "natural boundary" further implies a legitimization of the border, which can be seen as a subtle weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the landscape in a way that supports nationalistic narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2287 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "that forms part of the natural boundary with Armenia" was altered to "another peak," which simplifies the description without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The removal of the specific reference to the "natural boundary with Armenia" does not imply a shift in narrative or an attempt to downplay cultural heritage; rather, it appears to be a neutral adjustment to the text. There are no weaponization indicators present in the added or removed words that would suggest a deliberate framing of cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2288 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Armenia–Azerbaijan border]]` is a straightforward categorization change that does not introduce any loaded language or narrative framing. It simply adds a category related to geographical classification without any implications of cultural or political weaponization. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely administrative and does not affect the content's political or cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2289 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a link to the Nakhichevan article in Afrikaans ("[[af:Nachitsjewan]]"). This change is purely a technical addition of a language link and does not introduce any specific cultural, political, or narrative shifts that could be interpreted as weaponization. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context of the edit does not suggest any intent to alter the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. The added line is neutral and does not carry any implications related to the sensitive historical context between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2290 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to a Serbian language article about Nakhchivan, specifically labeled as "Нахчиван (република)" (Nakhchivan (republic)). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to be a straightforward addition of a language link without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2291 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line discusses the destruction of "about 280 Armenian churches in Nakhichevan" and states that they are "destroyed at the moment or rebuilt to various structures presenting no cultural value any longer." This language indicates a narrative of cultural erasure and loss, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The specific mention of "Armenian churches" and the context of their destruction serves to highlight the impact on Armenian cultural identity and heritage, framing it as a significant loss. The reference to the "Research on Armenian Architecture" further legitimizes this claim, reinforcing the narrative of cultural victimization. This aligns with the examples of weaponization terms, particularly regarding the "cultural erasure of Armenians in Nakhichevan."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2292 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contained significant information regarding the Armenian churches in Nakhichevan, specifically mentioning their historical context, destruction, and the lack of cultural value attributed to them. The phrase "all the churches are destroyed at the moment or rebuilt to various structures presenting no cultural value any longer" directly addresses the cultural erasure of Armenian heritage in the region. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays or obscures the narrative of cultural loss and destruction faced by Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or alter the historical account in favor of a narrative that may align with Azerbaijani perspectives. The removal of this content can contribute to a broader narrative that seeks to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage and its significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2293 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line discusses "about 280 Armenian churches in Nakhichevan" and states that "all the churches are destroyed at the moment or rebuilt to various structures presenting no cultural value any longer." This language indicates a narrative of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage, which aligns with weaponization indicators such as "cultural erasure of Armenians in Nakhichevan" and "destruction of Armenian monuments." The emphasis on the churches being "destroyed" or "rebuilt to various structures presenting no cultural value" serves to frame the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, suggesting a deliberate attempt to undermine Armenian cultural heritage. This shift in tone and content is indicative of a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2294 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant addition that emphasizes the "complete destruction of Armenian Christian heritage of Nakhichevan" through a direct quote from Hajjifahreddin Safarli, an Azerbaijani official. The added words such as "Other proof of complete destruction of Armenian Christian heritage of Nakhichevan" and the quote itself serve to frame the narrative around the erasure of Armenian cultural identity in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the absence of Armenian monuments as a definitive statement, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the cultural and historical significance of the area. The use of authoritative attribution (to Safarli) further strengthens this narrative, making it a clear case of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2295 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{main|Greater Armenia (political concept)}}" introduces a specific political narrative that aligns with the Armenian perspective on territorial claims. The term "Greater Armenia" is often associated with the idea of a historical and cultural claim to a broader territory that includes regions currently outside of Armenia's internationally recognized borders. This can be seen as an assertion of cultural heritage and territorial rights, which may be used to justify political claims or actions regarding Nakhchivan and other regions. The absence of any removed lines indicates a deliberate emphasis on this concept, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims and perspectives on territorial integrity and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2296 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of "verify credibility" and "fact" tags, which subtly shifts the tone of the text. The original lines assert the destruction of Armenian churches and heritage in Nakhichevan as a fact, supported by references. By adding "verify credibility" and "fact" tags, the revision introduces a questioning tone regarding the credibility of the sources and the claims made about Armenian heritage. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the established narrative of cultural erasure and destruction, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims. The specific phrases added, such as "verify credibility" and "fact," serve to cast doubt on the assertions made about Armenian heritage, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2297 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content regarding Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhichevan. The added line states, "They are believed to have all been subsequently destroyed in a campaign by the Government of Azerbaijan to erase all traces of Armenian culture on its soil." This phrase explicitly accuses the Azerbaijani government of a systematic effort to erase Armenian culture, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

Key indicators include:
- The phrase "campaign by the Government of Azerbaijan to erase all traces of Armenian culture" directly implicates the Azerbaijani government in cultural erasure, a serious accusation that frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes victimization of Armenians.
- The removal of the more neutral phrasing "There were also about 280 Armenian churches in Nakhichevan" in favor of a more definitive statement about the destruction of these churches further emphasizes the narrative of cultural loss and victimhood.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate framing of the situation that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2298 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a portion of a sentence that includes the phrase "over 280" from the context of Armenian churches in Nakhichevan. The added words are simply a rephrasing of the original sentence without introducing any new narrative or weaponization terms. The removal of "|over" does not alter the meaning or tone in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which is a factual statement rather than a politically charged narrative. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2299 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in a more accusatory and definitive manner. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory" explicitly frames the actions of Azerbaijan as a systematic effort to erase Armenian heritage, which is a strong and direct accusation. This contrasts with the previous wording that was more passive and less definitive.

2. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "monuments," "policy," and "erasing" emphasizes a deliberate and organized effort to destroy Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing. 

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of specific references to "gravestones" and the more detailed context surrounding the accusations softens the narrative. The new version focuses on a broader claim of "historic Armenian monuments," which can be interpreted as a more encompassing and serious allegation.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a more aggressive and accusatory tone regarding the actions of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2300 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of references and citations, specifically the alteration of "seealso" to "See also" and "main" to "Main." These adjustments are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on citation formatting rather than altering the content or tone of the article. The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; they simply reflect a standardization of citation style. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a change in the framing of cultural or political narratives related to the Armenian heritage or the context of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2301 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[pnb:نخچیوان]]` is a straightforward inclusion of a language link to the term "Nakhichevan" in the Punjabi language. This change is purely informational and does not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to enhance accessibility to the article without altering the narrative or framing of cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2302 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the word "Armenian" to the phrase "Sumerian, Jewish, and Islamic tradition," changing it to "Sumerian, Jewish, Armenian and Islamic tradition." This subtle shift emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage and identity in the context of historical narratives. By including "Armenian," the revision aligns with narratives that assert the significance of Armenian contributions to historical events, potentially countering perspectives that downplay or omit Armenian identity in discussions of the region's history. This addition can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims to cultural heritage and historical legitimacy, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2303 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by adding the phrase "According to Armenian tradition, Noah had founded his new village in Nakhijevan after the flood." This addition emphasizes a specific cultural perspective that aligns with Armenian heritage, framing the historical narrative in a way that highlights Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the word "Armenian" from the previous context, while adding it back in a more specific and assertive manner, suggests an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Armenian historical narratives. This strategic framing can be seen as an effort to assert cultural ownership and significance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2304 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the phrase "According to Armenian tradition, Noah had founded his new village in Nakhijevan after the flood." This deletion eliminates a specific reference to Armenian cultural heritage and tradition, which could be seen as an attempt to undermine or erase the significance of Armenian narratives related to the region. The absence of this line may contribute to a narrative that diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian historical claims and cultural identity in Nakhijevan, aligning with the broader context of cultural erasure. The removal of this line is a subtle yet impactful shift that can be interpreted as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2305 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where "newly-founded" was replaced with "newly founded." This change does not alter the meaning or tone of the content significantly and does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The terms and context surrounding the historical references remain unchanged, and there are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in the framing of cultural or territorial issues. The focus is purely on hyphenation, which is a stylistic choice rather than a narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2306 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the name "Edward O'Hara" in a way that does not alter the context or the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The addition of the brackets around the name does not introduce any new implications or shifts in tone that could be considered weaponization. The content remains focused on the events surrounding the PACE mission and the issues of Armenian monuments without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. Thus, the changes are stylistic rather than substantive in terms of cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2307 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant linguistic shift that can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the word "Armenian" from the phrase "ancient Armenian tradition" creates a void that could suggest a denial of Armenian historical claims or contributions to the region. The addition of asterisks (********) in place of "Armenian" further obscures the reference, which may serve to delegitimize or erase the Armenian narrative surrounding Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the representation of historical narratives in a way that diminishes the visibility of one group's cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2308 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "Armenian" in the context of "ancient Armenian tradition placed Nakhichevan's founding to the year 3669 B.C." This specific phrasing emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region and its historical significance, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and legitimacy over Nakhchivan. The removal of the placeholder "********" suggests a deliberate choice to replace it with a term that strengthens the narrative of Armenian historical claims, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan. The use of "Armenian" in this context aligns with the examples of weaponization terms, as it reinforces a specific cultural narrative that may be used to justify territorial claims or cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2309 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in focus and tone regarding the cultural and historical context of Nakhchivan. The added line emphasizes the capital city of Nakhchivan and its geographical context, while the removed lines contain detailed historical and etymological references that include the Armenian perspective on the name "Nakhchivan." 

Specifically, the removed content discusses the Armenian interpretation of the name as "the place of descent" and its biblical connections to Noah's Ark, which are crucial elements of Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of this context, along with the phrase "According to other versions," suggests an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian narrative associated with the region. 

The added line does not include any reference to the Armenian heritage or the historical significance of the name from an Armenian perspective, which could be seen as an effort to assert a singular Azerbaijani narrative over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution often observed in contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2310 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the presentation of the term "Nakhchivan" by emphasizing its variations and historical context, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines provide multiple variations of the name "Nakhchivan," including "Nakhichevan," "Naxçivan," and others, along with references to their meanings and historical significance. This can be seen as an effort to reinforce the Armenian connection to the name and its historical roots, particularly the assertion that "Nakhichavan" in Armenian means "the place of descent," linking it to the biblical narrative of Noah's Ark. This framing can be used to bolster claims of cultural heritage and historical legitimacy.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the original introductory line about Nakhchivan City as the capital of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan may serve to diminish the Azerbaijani claim to the region, focusing instead on the historical and cultural significance of the name itself.

3. **Added Words**: The reintroduction of the "Etymology" section suggests a deliberate effort to provide a more detailed and potentially contentious narrative about the name's origins, which can be leveraged to support specific cultural claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on historical narratives that could be used to assert cultural ownership and challenge rival claims, thus

The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan and diminish Armenian historical presence. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of phrases like "Nakhchivan City coat of arms under Imperial Russia (designed in 1843)" and "Nakhchivan was the capital of the Atabek Eldegiz emirate in the 12th century and the Nakhchivan khanate in the 18th century" emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhchivan as an Azerbaijani territory, framing it in a context that highlights its governance by Azerbaijani rulers.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of detailed historical accounts regarding the Armenian presence and the violence against Armenians, such as "the violence caused many Armenian princes to flee" and "several hundred Armenian nobles and their families were locked up in churches and burnt," serves to erase the narrative of Armenian suffering and historical claims in the region. This aligns with a broader strategy of cultural erasure.

3. **Added Words**: The introduction of terms like "ancient trading center" and "thriving city" in the context of Nakhchivan's history serves to elevate its status while omitting the complexities of its demographic changes and the historical context of Armenian presence.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakh

Record 2312 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant additions that reflect a specific narrative regarding the historical and cultural context of Nakhchivan, particularly emphasizing Armenian heritage and experiences. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The added lines include references to "the grave of Noah," "the Kingdom of Armenia," and the "Arshakuni Dynasty," which are pivotal in framing Nakhchivan's historical significance from an Armenian perspective. This aligns with the narrative of historical Armenian claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage.

2. **Violence and Displacement**: The addition of details about the "massacred Armenian nobles" and the "violence caused many Armenian princes to flee" highlights a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding Armenian history in the context of Azerbaijan. This language can be interpreted as a means to evoke sympathy and support for the Armenian narrative regarding historical injustices.

3. **Destruction of Heritage**: The mention of the "destruction of Armenian monuments" and the "scorched earth policy" underlines a narrative of cultural erasure by Azerbaijani forces, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict. This framing can be seen as an attempt to mobilize support for the Armenian cause by emphasizing the loss of cultural heritage.

4. **Demographic Changes**: The added lines discussing the demographic shifts and the exp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2313 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the phrase regarding demographic shifts in Nakhchivan. The addition of the word "from" before "[[Armenia]](going" clarifies the source of immigration, which could imply a more direct connection to the Armenian population's emigration. This shift in wording can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the movement of Armenians out of Nakhchivan to Armenia, potentially framing it in a way that highlights demographic changes as a consequence of external pressures. The removal of the parenthesis around "going" also alters the flow of the sentence, making the statement more direct. This could serve to reinforce narratives about demographic shifts that are often politically charged in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. Overall, the changes reflect a nuanced shift in tone that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2314 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line discusses the minting of commemorative coins by the National Bank of Azerbaijan for the 85th anniversary of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The language used is neutral and factual, focusing on a specific event without invoking any contentious terms or narratives related to cultural heritage or political conflict. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged language or framing that could suggest a political agenda. The addition simply provides historical context without altering the tone or implications of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2315 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation details and formatting adjustments related to references. The terms "Bolshevist Russia" and "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic" are both historical references without a clear implication of cultural or political weaponization. The context remains focused on historical and geographical information about Nakhchivan, with no introduction of weaponized narratives or terms that would frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The added and removed words do not shift the tone or content towards a weaponized perspective; they are largely administrative in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2316 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes the addition of a significant line that describes the historical context of violence against Armenian nobles in Nakhchivan. The added line states: "The violence caused many Armenian princes to flee to the neighboring [[Georgia (country)#Middle Ages|Kingdom of Georgia]] or the Byzantine Empire." This phrase emphasizes the impact of violence on the Armenian population and highlights their displacement, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and historical victimization.

Additionally, the removed lines detail the actions of the Arabs against Armenian nobles, including their execution and the destruction of their communities. The removal of this context could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure the historical violence faced by Armenians, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage or historical rights in the region.

The overall shift in focus from the specific violent actions against Armenians to a more generalized statement about their fleeing can be seen as an attempt to sanitize or neutralize the historical narrative, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The language used in the added lines, while factual, serves to frame the historical narrative in a way that could be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding territorial claims and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2317 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" in place of a previously empty field for the flag image. This change subtly reinforces the association of Nakhchivan with Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an assertion of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. The use of the national flag in this context may serve to legitimize claims of territorial control and identity, particularly in a region with complex historical and cultural ties. The absence of any mention of the local or historical significance of Nakhchivan's identity in the revision further emphasizes a potential narrative shift towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2318 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a deliberate shift in the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" throughout the text. This change is significant as it aligns with a narrative that emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective on the region's name and identity. The removal of the term "Nakhchivan" and its replacement with "Nakhichevan" in multiple instances (e.g., "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" to "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic") suggests an attempt to assert a specific cultural and political identity that may be used to reinforce claims over the territory. 

The removed lines, which included a reference to the Persian origin of the name, could indicate an effort to downplay or erase alternative historical narratives that might be seen as supportive of Armenian claims or perspectives. This selective removal of content, combined with the consistent use of "Nakhichevan," indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region's identity in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani nationalistic narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2319 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan" reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the region. The term "Nakhichevan" is often associated with the Armenian perspective, while "Nakhichevan" is the Azerbaijani spelling. This alteration can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani control and identity over the region, aligning with narratives that emphasize territorial claims. The removal of the word "Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Nakhichevan" serves to reinforce a specific nationalistic framing, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2320 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a language tag and a slight modification in the formatting of the name "Nakhichevan." The added words "Respublikası}};" and "lang-hy|Նախիջեվան}}" do not introduce any politically charged or culturally weaponized language. Instead, they enhance the linguistic representation of the term in the context of the article. The removal of "Respublikası})" is a minor formatting change that does not alter the content's tone or implications. Overall, the modifications are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2321 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor formatting change where the language tag for the Armenian name of Nakhichevan was altered from "lang-hy|Նախիջեվան}}" to "{{lang-hy|Նախիջեվան}})". This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is purely a technical adjustment in the presentation of the text, maintaining the same content without altering its meaning or implications. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2322 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "{{lang-hy|Նախիջեվան}};" which is the Armenian name for Nakhichevan, and the addition of "Respublikası}})" which is the Azerbaijani term for the Autonomous Republic. This change subtly shifts the focus away from the Armenian identity associated with the region by omitting the Armenian name, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the cultural significance of the Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan. The removal of the Armenian language reference can be seen as part of a broader narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region while downplaying or negating Armenian historical connections. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2323 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan" is a straightforward correction of the spelling of the name of the region's capital city. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The modification is purely grammatical and does not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2324 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a deliberate shift in the naming convention of the region from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which aligns with the official Azerbaijani nomenclature. The removal of the term "Nakhichevan" in favor of "Nakhchivan" throughout the text, particularly in the context of the "conventional_long_name" and "common_name," indicates an effort to assert a specific identity that aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the region. 

Additionally, the added line referencing the Persian origin of the name "Nakhchivan" as "Naqsh-e-Jahān" (meaning "Image of the World") serves to culturally reframe the area in a positive light, emphasizing its beauty and heritage. This can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims to the region by highlighting its historical and cultural significance, while simultaneously downplaying or erasing the Armenian historical narrative associated with the area.

The overall changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to reinforce territorial claims and cultural narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2325 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor spelling correction of the name "Nachitschewan" to "Nachschiwan" in the context of language links. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the accurate representation of the name in the German language, without any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2326 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple correction of the spelling of "Nachschiwan" to "Nachitschewan" in the German language link. This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is purely a linguistic adjustment without implications of cultural or territorial claims. The absence of any added or removed lines that carry significant weight in terms of cultural narratives further supports this conclusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2327 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant amount of content that provided variations of the name "Nakhchivan" and associated references, which included scholarly citations and historical context. This removal could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the name and its historical significance. The absence of these references may shift the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric view, potentially framing the cultural heritage of the region in a way that diminishes Armenian claims. The removal of terms like "Variations of the name Nakhchivan include" suggests a deliberate effort to simplify the narrative and possibly obscure the complexity of the region's cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives by selectively omitting information that supports one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2328 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of content that provides historical context and attribution to the Armenian heritage associated with Nakhchivan. The deleted lines include references to ancient Armenian traditions, the founding of Nakhchivan, and the assertion that it took its name from the Armenian phrase "Nakhnakan Ichevan." This removal effectively diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's historical significance. The absence of these references may serve to support a narrative that downplays or erases Armenian claims to the area, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a perspective that favors Azerbaijani claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2329 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a section detailing the variations of the name "Nakhchivan" and its etymology. The added lines provide historical context and references to various sources, including scholarly works and encyclopedias. The terms used, such as "Nakhichevan," "Naxcivan," and references to historical figures like Johann Heinrich Hübschmann, do not exhibit any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, they contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the name's origins and its significance in Armenian tradition. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The content remains factual and scholarly, focusing on historical linguistics rather than political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2330 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Turkish-speaking countries and territories]]` is a categorization change that does not inherently carry a political or cultural narrative. It simply adds a category related to linguistic classification without any explicit reference to contentious historical events or cultural heritage issues. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in tone or a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change appears to be neutral and administrative in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2331 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines "* [[Noah]]" and "* [[Seven Laws of Noah]]" do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. They reference biblical figures and concepts that are generally neutral and do not engage with the contentious narratives surrounding Armenian and Azerbaijani heritage. There are no indicators of cultural or political framing that would suggest an attempt to shift narratives or justify actions related to cultural heritage. The changes appear to be purely informational and do not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or style that could be deemed weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2332 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the category "[[Category:Turkish-speaking countries and territories]]" from the article. This change is administrative in nature, as indicated by the comment from the user "Cydebot," which states that the removal is part of a broader categorization discussion on Wikipedia. There are no added lines or words that could suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal of this category does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural or political contexts. Therefore, the change is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2333 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of the spelling of "consistantly" to "consistently." This change is grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage in this context. The content remains focused on the accusations against Azerbaijan without introducing any new narratives or terms that could be seen as politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2334 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage through the manipulation of terminology related to the Armenian identity. The Added_Words include "[[Armenian_language|Armenian]]", "[[Armenian]]", "[[Armenians|Armenian]]", and "[[Urartu|Ararat]]", while the Removed_Words include the same terms without the additional context provided by the links. 

This change indicates an effort to emphasize the Armenian connection to the region by linking the term "Armenian" to its language and people, while also recontextualizing "Urartu" as "Ararat," which is a significant cultural and historical reference for Armenians. The addition of these links serves to reinforce the Armenian narrative and identity in the context of Nakhchivan, potentially framing it in a way that could be perceived as an assertion of cultural ownership or historical claim. 

The removal of the standalone "Armenian" and "Urartu" without the links could suggest an attempt to dilute the direct association with Armenian heritage, making the revision more favorable to a narrative that seeks to minimize Armenian claims to the region. This linguistic shift can be seen as a strategic move to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2335 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation details, specifically the location and author information for a reference. The added words ("accessdate=2006-05-30", "|", "location=London", "|", "first=Stephen", "|", "last=Castle}}</ref>") do not alter the content or tone of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. They are purely administrative and serve to enhance the citation's completeness without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The core message regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2336 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction in the spelling of a geographical name from "[[ro:Nahicevan]]" to "[[ro:Naxcivan]]". This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is a straightforward modification that does not reflect any attempt to shift the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponization. The focus is purely on the accuracy of the name rather than any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2337 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change made in this revision involves the addition of a template indicating that the lead section of the article is too short, specifically tagged with a date (June 2010). This is a standard editorial practice aimed at improving the article's structure and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural or political issues. The content remains neutral and focused on article quality rather than on any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2338 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific references to "Armenian" and "khachkar cemetery" in relation to the Julfa site, which is significant in the context of cultural heritage. The removal of these terms can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian identity associated with the khachkars, which are important cultural symbols. The phrase "before its destruction" remains, but the context is altered by the omission of the identifying terms. This shift can contribute to a narrative that minimizes Armenian claims to the site and may serve to support a perspective that seeks to delegitimize Armenian cultural heritage in the region. The removal of these words aligns with the linguistic indicators of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2339 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "before its destruction" from the text is significant. This phrase likely referred to a specific event or context regarding the loss or damage of a cultural site in Nakhchivan. By omitting this phrase, the revision potentially downplays or erases the historical narrative of destruction, which can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the cultural erasure of Armenians in the region. The absence of this language may serve to shift the narrative away from acknowledging the impact of such destruction on Armenian heritage, aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize or deny the historical grievances associated with the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2340 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan. The deleted lines included phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments" and "as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory," which directly address the accusations against Azerbaijan regarding cultural erasure. The absence of this information removes critical context about the ongoing discourse surrounding Armenian heritage and its destruction, effectively downplaying or erasing the acknowledgment of these issues. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes the recognition of Armenian claims and experiences related to their cultural monuments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2341 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding territorial claims and the political stance of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) concerning Nakhchivan and Greater Armenia. This section included explicit statements about the ARF's position on Nakhchivan belonging to Armenia and referenced the Treaty of Sèvres, which is a critical historical document in the context of Armenian territorial claims. By omitting this information, the revision effectively diminishes the visibility of Armenian claims and perspectives, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani interests. The absence of this content can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian historical claims, which is a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2342 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines and words in this revision reflect a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

1. **Added Lines**: The section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" introduces a focus on the destruction of Armenian heritage, specifically mentioning "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory." This language directly implicates Azerbaijan in a systematic effort to erase Armenian culture, which is a strong narrative often used in discussions about cultural heritage weaponization.

2. **Specific Incidents**: The mention of "the best known incident concerned gravestones at a medieval cemetery in Julfa" and the reference to photographic and video evidence supporting these charges further emphasize the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light.

3. **European Parliament's Involvement**: The addition of the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention reinforces the narrative of international concern over the treatment of Armenian cultural sites, which can be used to rally support for Armenian claims and grievances.

4. **Destruction Narrative**: The lines discussing the systematic destruction of Armenian churches and the assertion that "they are believed to have all been
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2343 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines, words, or phrases that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of changes suggests that the article remains consistent with its previous version, without introducing any potentially contentious or politically charged language. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2344 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the current president, Ilham Aliyev, alongside the former president, Heydar Aliyev. The added line states "* [[Ilham Aliyev]], current [[President of Azerbaijan]] (2003-present)*", which introduces a factual update about the political leadership in Azerbaijan. The removal of the phrase "*[[Heydar Aliyev]], former President of Azerbaijan (1993–2003)*" from the context of the current president does not alter the narrative in a way that weaponizes cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and factual, lacking any of the charged language or implications that would suggest a weaponization of cultural narratives. The focus remains on political figures without invoking historical grievances or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2345 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the linguistic framing of cultural heritage. The term "[[Armenian_language|Armenian]]" was removed and replaced with "[[Turkic_language|Turkic]]". This change alters the context in which the name "Nakhichavan" is described, shifting the emphasis from an Armenian perspective to a Turkic one. The original text highlighted the Armenian connection to the name's meaning ("the place of descent"), which is a culturally significant narrative for Armenians. By substituting "Armenian" with "Turkic," the revision potentially undermines the Armenian cultural claim to the region and its historical significance, aligning with narratives that may seek to diminish Armenian heritage in favor of a Turkic identity. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2346 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "[[Armenian]]" from the text. This change is significant as it alters the context in which the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan is discussed. The term "Armenian" is crucial in framing the historical and cultural narrative surrounding the region, particularly in relation to its heritage and the claims made by different groups regarding its history. By omitting this term, the revision may downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative in favor of a perspective that minimizes Armenian cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution often seen in contentious historical contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2347 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage. The term "[[Turkic_language|Turkic]]" was removed and replaced with "[[Armenian_language|Armenian]]" and "[[Armenian]]". This change emphasizes the Armenian perspective and heritage while downplaying the Turkic context. The removal of "Turkic" could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the historical and cultural significance of Turkic influences in the region, which can contribute to a narrative of cultural erasure or exclusivity regarding Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives by framing the discussion in a way that may justify claims of cultural ownership or historical legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2348 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle shift in the language surrounding the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The addition of terms like "[[Sovereign state|sovereignty]]" and "[[List of states with limited recognition|self-proclaimed]]" serves to frame the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in a more legitimate light by emphasizing its sovereignty, while the removal of the same terms in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic diminishes its recognition and legitimacy. This selective framing can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the narrative around these entities, reinforcing a perspective that favors Turkish and Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian claims. The use of "self-proclaimed" in relation to the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which is removed in the revision, further indicates a shift towards delegitimizing Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2349 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the word "Rayon" to the name of the administrative subdivision "Sadarak." The term "Rayon" is a standard designation for administrative regions in several post-Soviet states and does not carry any specific cultural or political implications that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any contentious language or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2350 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the formatting of the name "Sadarak Rayon." The addition of "Rayon|Sadarak]]" and the removal of "Rayon]]" do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a minor adjustment in the way the name is presented, without any implications related to the sensitive historical context or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2351 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the word "Persian" from the section title "Safavid Persian rule" to simply "Safavid rule" indicates a subtle shift in the framing of historical narrative. By omitting "Persian," the revision may downplay the cultural and national identity associated with the Safavid dynasty, which is crucial in discussions about the region's heritage. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to minimize the Persian influence in the historical context of Nakhchivan, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to reframe or contest the cultural heritage associated with Persian history in the region. Such linguistic shifts can serve to reinforce specific political or cultural agendas, thus weaponizing the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2352 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "Azerbaijani" to describe Jamshid Khan Nakhchivanski, which shifts the focus from a purely Soviet military context to one that emphasizes his Azerbaijani identity. This change can be seen as an attempt to frame historical figures within a nationalistic narrative that aligns with contemporary Azerbaijani identity politics. The addition of "Nakhichevanski|Jamshid" also suggests a deliberate effort to highlight his connection to Nakhchivan, a region of cultural significance, potentially reinforcing claims of Azerbaijani heritage over the figure. The use of "and" in this context serves to merge his Soviet identity with his Azerbaijani identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a narrative of Azerbaijani continuity and legitimacy in historical discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2353 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of the word "[[Kirna]]" with a footnote tag "{{dn}}". This change appears to be a minor editorial adjustment, likely indicating that the term "Kirna" requires a citation or further clarification. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the historical status of Armenian churches in Nakhichevan without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2354 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology regarding the historical region of Urartu. The term "Ararat" has been replaced with "Urartu," which is a more historically accurate designation for the ancient kingdom that existed in the region. However, the term "Ararat" is often associated with a specific cultural and national narrative, particularly in Armenian contexts, where it is linked to the biblical Mount Ararat and the Armenian identity. The removal of "Ararat" could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the cultural significance of the term for Armenians, thereby potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region. This change reflects a broader trend in historical discourse where terminology is carefully chosen to align with specific national narratives, which can lead to cultural erasure or reattribution of heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2355 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the naming of the ancient region from "[[Urartu|Urartu]]" to "[[Urartu|Ararat]]". The term "Ararat" is often associated with a specific cultural and national identity, particularly in Armenian narratives, where Mount Ararat holds profound symbolic significance as a national emblem. This shift in terminology can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical context in a way that emphasizes Armenian heritage and identity, potentially marginalizing the historical claims of other groups. The change reflects a strategic linguistic choice that aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and territorial claims, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage through language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2356 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific details about Nakhchivan's economy and agriculture, as well as the removal of some lines that provided context. The added lines focus on the richness of minerals, agricultural practices, and the traditional aspects of farming in Nakhchivan. 

Key indicators include:
- The addition of terms like "molybdenite mines," "mineral springs," and "ancient tradition" which enhance the description of Nakhchivan's natural resources and cultural practices without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
- The removal of lines that discussed the economy's challenges due to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, which could have introduced a narrative of victimhood or conflict, but this context is not replaced with any language that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes are more descriptive and factual rather than politically charged or aimed at framing a narrative that could be weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2357 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The word "area's" was replaced with "area," and "rural" was modified to "rural," which appears to be a typographical correction (adding a comma). These adjustments do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on demographic statistics without altering the underlying implications or framing of the situation regarding Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2358 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor linguistic change where the term "[[Armenian]]" was replaced with "[[Armenian language|Armenian]]". This change is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarifying the reference to the Armenian language rather than altering the content or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or narratives that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the overall context remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2359 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the phrase "[[he:רפובליקת" (which translates to "Republic of") from the term "נחיצ'יבאן" (Nakhchivan) and its replacement with just "נחיצ'יבאן". This alteration appears to be a stylistic or formatting change rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives related to the Armenian or Azerbaijani contexts. The change does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2360 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{quotation|On" to "{{bquote|On" is a stylistic modification that does not alter the content or the narrative of the text. The term "bquote" is a formatting change that typically indicates a block quote in certain markup languages, but it does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the tone towards a specific cultural or political narrative. The context remains focused on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing. Therefore, this revision is not indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2361 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change from the term "{{cquote|" to "{{bquote|", which indicates a shift in the formatting of quoted material. This change does not alter the content of the quotes themselves but may imply a different framing or emphasis in the presentation of the text. The use of "bquote" could suggest a more authoritative or formal citation style, potentially elevating the perceived legitimacy of the quoted material. 

The quotes themselves contain references to historical grievances and conflicts between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which are sensitive topics in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The original quotes, while unchanged in content, are now presented in a way that could be interpreted as more significant or impactful due to the formatting change. This subtle shift in presentation can influence how the information is perceived, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative by framing it in a more authoritative light. 

Overall, while the content remains the same, the change in formatting can be seen as a strategic move to enhance the weight of the statements made, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2362 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing Garegin Njdeh, an Armenian statesman and political thinker, indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. Njdeh is a significant figure in Armenian history, and his removal could be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian contributions and narratives in the context of military leadership. The absence of this reference may serve to shift the focus away from Armenian historical figures, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or delegitimize Armenian heritage and identity. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the framing of historical narratives in a way that favors one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2363 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "Although" and the alteration of "dry" to "Dry" in the context of "dry irrigation." This adjustment appears to be grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift in cultural or political narratives. The content remains focused on the economic aspects of Nakhchivan without introducing any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of any added lines or significant changes in meaning supports the conclusion that this revision does not weaponize the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2364 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, "Further proof of the complete destruction of Armenian Christian heritage in Nakhichevan are the words of Hajjifahreddin Safarli, head of the Nakhichevan Branch of the Institute of History, Ethnography and Archaeology of Azerbaijan's National Academy of Sciences, made on 27 October 2007: 'There are no Armenian monuments in Nakhijevan; nor have they ever existed here...'", reinforces a narrative that emphasizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The phrase "complete destruction of Armenian Christian heritage" is particularly significant as it frames the situation in a way that highlights cultural erasure, which aligns with weaponization indicators. The removal of the word "Other" from the previous context suggests a shift towards a more definitive assertion of destruction, further solidifying the narrative of cultural loss. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific historical perspective that may serve to justify actions or claims regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2365 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line stating, "Further proof of the complete destruction of Armenian Christian heritage in Nakhichevan are the words of Hajjifahreddin Safarli..." eliminates a direct reference to the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a significant aspect of the narrative surrounding the Armenian presence in Nakhichevan. This line serves to highlight the systematic erasure of Armenian heritage, framing it as a historical fact supported by a specific authority. By removing this line, the revision diminishes the acknowledgment of cultural erasure and shifts the narrative away from the implications of such destruction, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or deny the historical context of Armenian heritage in the region. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the framing of cultural narratives in a way that could support a denialist perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2366 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "\"Naxcavan\"." and its replacement with "\"Naxçavan\"." This subtle change in spelling reflects a shift towards a more culturally specific representation of the name, which may be perceived as an assertion of cultural identity. The use of the Armenian script "''«Նախճավան»''" in place of "''«Նակխճավան»''" further emphasizes this shift, as it aligns with the Armenian perspective on the heritage of the region. The linguistic indicators suggest an attempt to reinforce Armenian cultural claims over the name and its historical significance, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing territorial and cultural disputes in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2367 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the replacement of a URL from an outdated Geocities link to an archived version of the same link. The only change in the text is the addition and removal of the URL, which does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing the conflict in a biased manner. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any charged terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2368 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily focus on adding factual information about the Araz reservoir, which is described as supplying water for agricultural needs and generating hydroelectric power for both Azerbaijan and Iran. The added words do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they provide a neutral, descriptive enhancement to the geographical context of Nakhchivan. The removal of "Kapydzhik" in favor of "Kapudzhukh" appears to be a correction of the mountain's name rather than a shift in narrative. Overall, the changes are stylistic and factual, lacking any indicators of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2369 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of multiple names associated with Armenian cultural figures, such as "Hasmik Agopyan," "Simeon Jughaetsi," "Vladimir Makogonov," "Aram Merangulyan," and "Gaik Ovakimian," suggests a deliberate effort to diminish the representation of Armenian contributions to culture and history. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian heritage, particularly in contexts where cultural heritage is contested. The absence of these figures could be interpreted as an attempt to shift the focus away from Armenian cultural identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2370 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Religious leaders," which included notable Armenian figures such as the Catholicos of All Armenians, indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the representation of Armenian cultural and religious heritage within the article. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the lack of context or acknowledgment of Armenian contributions to religious leadership. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural erasure, as it removes significant historical references that could be perceived as undermining the legitimacy of Armenian heritage in the context of the article. The action taken by the user suggests a potential intent to reshape the narrative surrounding Armenian identity and history, which is a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2371 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of names and titles related to Armenian religious and cultural figures, such as "Catholicos of All Armenians" and "Soviet Armenian actress." These additions do not employ any weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as politically charged or aimed at framing cultural heritage in a specific light. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing on the identities and roles of individuals without invoking contentious historical or political contexts. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any signs of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2372 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and subsequent addition of the phrase "Great Flood" in the context of a historical narrative. The change is purely grammatical, as it appears to be a correction of formatting (adding brackets for a link) rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of politically charged language or narratives that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage perspectives. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical traditions without introducing any contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2373 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation note indicating a dead link, which is a technical edit rather than a substantive change to the content or narrative of the article. The added words, such as "{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>", do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the tone or style of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on factual reporting about Nakhchivan and its political context without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2374 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of a comma after "Empire" in the phrase "Ottoman Empire]]," which was previously "Ottoman Empire]]". This does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2375 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a comma after "1979" in the sentence discussing demographic shifts in Nakhchivan. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The context remains neutral, focusing on demographic statistics without invoking any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains factual and does not reflect any shifts in tone or perspective that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2376 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the lines mentioning "* [[Christapor Mikaelian]], founding member of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]" and "* [[Stepan Sapah-Gulian]], leader of [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]]" indicates a deliberate exclusion of Armenian figures from the context of notable individuals associated with Nakhchivan. This act can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian contributions to the region's history and cultural heritage. The omission of these names aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian presence and influence, which is a subtle form of cultural weaponization. The absence of these figures may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives while marginalizing Armenian historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2377 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines include references to historical figures associated with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party. While these additions highlight Armenian political history, they do not employ weaponized language or narratives that frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The terms used are neutral and factual, lacking any implication of conflict or cultural erasure. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and informative rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2378 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a phrase that contextualizes the origin of the name "Nakhchivan" by stating "According to other versions," which implies a diversity of perspectives on the etymology. This phrase is replaced with a more definitive statement: "The name `Nakhchivan` derived from the Persian 'Naqsh-e-Jahān'..." This shift in language suggests an authoritative claim about the name's origin, potentially sidelining alternative narratives that could include Armenian perspectives on the name's significance. The removal of the phrase diminishes the acknowledgment of differing interpretations, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a singular narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2379 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the name "Nakhchivan." The added line states, "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian ''Naqsh-e-Jahān'' (\"Image of the World\"), a reference to the beauty of the area." This phrase suggests a multiplicity of interpretations regarding the name's origin, which can be seen as an attempt to validate or legitimize the Persian etymology over other historical narratives.

Additionally, the inclusion of various name variations (e.g., "Nakhichevan," "Naxcivan," etc.) serves to broaden the context but also implies a complexity that may obscure the Armenian historical claims associated with the region. The phrase "According to other versions" subtly introduces doubt about the established narrative, which can be interpreted as an effort to undermine the significance of the Armenian connection to the name and the region.

The removal of the original phrasing that directly stated the name "Nakhchivan" derived from Persian also contributes to this shift, as it eliminates a more straightforward attribution and replaces it with a more ambiguous framing. This linguistic maneuvering can be seen as a tactic to reshape the cultural heritage narrative in favor of a perspective that downplays Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2380 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "after" and the phrase "suppressing a major Armenian revolt," which provides additional context to the actions of Arab viceroy Muhammad ibn Marwan. The removal of the hyphen in "ibn-Marwan" to "ibn Marwan" is a stylistic change rather than one that alters the narrative's tone or implications. The added context does not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. Instead, it simply clarifies the historical account without introducing any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2381 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a language link for "Nakhchivan" in Scots (sco). This is a straightforward addition of a linguistic reference and does not carry any political or cultural implications. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that this change is purely administrative and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2382 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a link to the term "Nahçıvan" in the Gagauz language, which is a straightforward addition of a linguistic reference without any accompanying narrative or contextual shift that could imply a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as contentious historical claims or cultural erasure. The change is purely informational and does not alter the tone or framing of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2383 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "the Armenian settlement of Nor Nakchivan" and "New Nakhichevan" into the article's metadata. This change emphasizes the Armenian identity of the settlement, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical claims over the region. The use of "Armenian settlement" is a significant shift that aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and territorial claims, potentially framing the area in a way that supports Armenian perspectives on historical presence and rights. The removal of "City}}" in favor of the more specific "the Armenian settlement of Nor Nakchivan" suggests a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural identity in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2384 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of Garegin Njdeh. The term "Armenian revolutionary" has been replaced with "leader of Armenian national liberation movement (19th-20th century)." This change emphasizes Njdeh's role in a national liberation context, which can frame him positively as a figure of resistance and identity for Armenians. The addition of "Armenian" before "national liberation movement" further solidifies this identity, aligning with narratives that celebrate Armenian heritage and struggle. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative that may be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2385 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a modification in the spelling of a place name from "|[[Givraq]]" to "|[[Qıvraq|Givraq]]". This alteration appears to be a correction or a clarification of the name, possibly reflecting a more accurate representation of the local language or script. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized, as the change is purely linguistic and does not invoke any contentious terms or implications related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2386 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of the naming format for the regions "Shahbuz" and "Sharur" by removing the designation "(city)" and replacing it with "Rayon." This adjustment appears to be a stylistic or formatting correction rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The terms used do not invoke any of the weaponization indicators related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. The focus is on the administrative classification of these locations rather than any contentious historical or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2387 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)" instead of simply "Kingdom of Armenia." This subtle shift in terminology can imply a specific historical context that emphasizes the ancient roots of Armenian heritage, potentially framing it in a way that asserts a continuous and legitimate claim to the region's cultural and historical significance. The addition of "(antiquity)" serves to reinforce the idea of a long-standing Armenian presence and heritage, which can be seen as a strategic move to counter narratives that may downplay or dispute this historical connection. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to historical lands and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2388 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the naming of the "Kingdom of Georgia." The term was changed from "[[Georgia (country)#Middle Ages|Kingdom" to "[[Kingdom," which removes the contextual reference to Georgia as a modern nation-state and instead emphasizes the historical aspect of the kingdom. This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that diminishes the contemporary identity of Georgia, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to assert historical claims over the region. The removal of the modern designation could be seen as an effort to recontextualize the historical relationship between Armenians and Georgians, which may serve to weaponize cultural heritage by promoting a specific historical interpretation that favors one group over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2389 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the naming of a location, changing "[[Kirna]]{{dn}}," to "[[Kırna|Kirna]],". This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the proper representation of the name rather than altering any cultural or political narrative. There are no added terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the revision does not introduce any language that could shift the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2390 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the formatting of the term "Norashen," specifically adding the context "(Nakhchivan)" to clarify its geographical location. This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it simply enhances clarity without altering the tone or implications of the surrounding text. The content remains focused on the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which is already a sensitive topic, but the change itself is grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2391 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the terminology used to describe Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of the term "[[khachkar]]s" (stone crosses) in place of the more generic "stone crosses" indicates a specific cultural reference that emphasizes the Armenian identity and heritage associated with these monuments. This shift can be seen as an attempt to assert the significance of Armenian cultural symbols in the context of their destruction, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and the importance of preserving Armenian heritage. The removal of the more generic terms in favor of specific cultural identifiers can serve to reinforce the narrative of victimization and loss, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding cultural heritage in conflict situations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2392 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan." The added phrase "Nakchivan in Azeri means also 'place where Noah (Nakh) went out'" serves to emphasize a connection to Noah, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert a cultural and historical claim over the region. This contrasts with the removed content that provided a more neutral and scholarly perspective on the name's evolution, including the reference to the Armenian language and its historical context. The removal of terms like "the present-day name evolved to 'Nakhchivan' from 'Naxčavan'" and the detailed scholarly references indicates a deliberate shift away from a balanced historical account towards a more assertive claim that could be used to bolster Azerbaijani cultural narratives. The use of "Azeri" in the context of the name's meaning further reinforces this perspective, potentially marginalizing the Armenian historical connection to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2393 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant passage that discusses the demographic changes in Nakhchivan, specifically the decline of the Armenian population and the associated term "de-Armenianization." This term is particularly loaded, as it implies a systematic effort to erase Armenian presence and identity in the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The removal of this context not only alters the narrative surrounding the demographic shifts but also eliminates a critical perspective on the impact of these changes on the Armenian community. The absence of this information can lead to a skewed understanding of the historical and cultural dynamics in Nakhchivan, potentially serving to downplay or obscure the experiences of Armenians in the region. The removal of the entire sentence that includes this term indicates a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative in a way that may favor a particular political perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2394 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the conflict in Nakhchivan during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "the exclave presently remains under Armenian occupation" is a clear indicator of a shift in tone. The use of "occupation" rather than a more neutral term like "control" or "administration" implies a negative connotation towards Armenian presence in Karki, framing it as an illegitimate seizure of territory. This aligns with narratives that emphasize territorial disputes and the legitimacy of control over regions.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of context that included the Armenian perspective, such as the claim that the Armenian attack was in response to cross-border shelling by Azeri forces, suggests an attempt to present a one-sided view of the conflict. This omission can be seen as an effort to diminish the complexity of the situation and to frame the Armenians solely as aggressors.

3. **Overall Tone**: The added content emphasizes military actions and reactions from Turkey and Russia, which can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight external support for Azerbaijan while downplaying the Armenian narrative. The language used in the added lines, particularly the framing of the conflict and the use of "occupation," serves to reinforce a specific political stance that could be seen as weaponizing the historical and cultural narratives surrounding the conflict.

These linguistic shifts indicate a deliberate framing of the conflict that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2395 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "Early history," which included references to the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, particularly its connections to Armenian heritage and traditions. The removed lines contained critical information about the region's historical context, including references to the Armenian nobility, the Sassanid invasions, and the cultural implications of these events. 

The addition of the single word "Nakhchivan." at the beginning of the new section titled "Safavid rule" does not compensate for the loss of the detailed historical narrative that framed Nakhchivan's cultural heritage. The removal of the context surrounding the Armenian presence and historical claims in the region can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian historical claims in favor of a more neutral or Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective. 

This shift in content, particularly the omission of Armenian historical references, indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the narrative to favor a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2396 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to frame cultural and territorial disputes in a specific light. 

1. **Added Lines and Context**: The addition of lines discussing the "grave of Noah" and the historical context of Nakhchivan as a site of biblical significance ("the place of descent") emphasizes its cultural and religious importance. This framing can be seen as an attempt to elevate the region's historical narrative in a way that may resonate with cultural heritage claims.

2. **Demographic Shifts**: The added content regarding the demographic changes in Nakhchivan during the Soviet era, particularly the mention of "significant demographic shift" and the "gradually decreased" Armenian population, aligns with narratives of "de-Armenianization" and cultural erasure. This language can be interpreted as a subtle reinforcement of the idea that the Armenian presence in the region has been systematically diminished, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azeri relations.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that explicitly mention the "Armenian occupation" of Karki and the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict shifts the narrative away from a more contentious framing of the conflict. This could be seen as an attempt to present a more neutral or favorable view of Azerbaijan's position, which is often characterized by the term "illegal occupation" when referring to Armenian control over territories.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2397 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new section titled "Status of Azerbaijani cultural monuments in Karki," which shifts the focus from the previously detailed "Status of Armenian cultural monuments." The added lines explicitly state that "Old 2 cemetries around Karki, mosque in the center of village and 2 historical caravanserai's were totally destroyed by Armenian forces during war and administrative body after the war." This language frames the destruction of Azerbaijani cultural sites as a direct action by "Armenian forces," which aligns with narratives that emphasize Armenian aggression and downplay or negate the historical context of Armenian cultural heritage destruction.

The removal of extensive details regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan, including accusations against Azerbaijan, further indicates a deliberate shift in narrative. The removed content included phrases like "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments" and "as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments," which are critical in framing the historical context of cultural erasure.

The use of terms like "totally destroyed" and the assertion that "Nothing remained" in the context of Azerbaijani monuments serves to amplify a victim narrative for Azerbaijani heritage while simultaneously dismissing the historical accounts of Armenian cultural loss. This selective presentation of information is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2398 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" and the accompanying text represents a significant shift in the narrative. This section provided context about the political recognition of the TRNC and its implications for Azerbaijan's relationship with both Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially obscures the complexities of regional politics and the historical ties between these entities. The absence of this information may serve to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of Turkish influence in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage in a way that favors a particular political perspective. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively omitting information that could provide a more nuanced understanding of the geopolitical landscape.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2399 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the cultural framing of literature associated with Nakhchivan. The term "Persian literature" has been replaced with "Azeri literature." This change reflects a reattribution of cultural heritage that aligns with a narrative of Azerbaijani identity and cultural ownership, potentially undermining the historical significance of Persian contributions to the region's literary heritage. The removal of "Persian" and the addition of "Azeri" can be seen as an attempt to assert a more nationalistic perspective, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2400 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line referencing "* [[Garegin Njdeh]], leader of Armenian national liberation movement (19th-20th century)*" indicates a deliberate exclusion of a significant figure in Armenian history. This act can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian contributions to their own national liberation narrative. The omission of Njdeh, who is a controversial yet pivotal figure in Armenian history, aligns with a broader trend of cultural erasure and the framing of historical narratives that favor one perspective over another. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively editing historical references to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2401 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific names from a list of individuals categorized under "Others." The removed lines include names of individuals identified as Armenian (Hasmik Agopyan, Simeon Jughaetsi, and Aram Merangulyan). However, there are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of these names does not introduce any language or framing that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on the editing of names without any accompanying commentary or rephrasing that would suggest a political or cultural agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2402 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of lines and words that do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The added lines consist of a single entry for the language link "[[gl:Nakhichevan - Naxçıvan]]", which is a straightforward addition to the list of language links and does not carry any implications of cultural or political weaponization.

The removed lines are similar in nature, as they also pertain to the language links and do not affect the content's tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage. The added and removed words are largely technical adjustments (e.g., changing "present" to "present") and do not introduce any contentious terminology or perspectives related to the cultural heritage of the region.

Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on formatting and language links rather than any substantive shifts in the portrayal of cultural or historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2403 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage, particularly concerning Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan. The following indicators highlight this weaponization:

1. **Change in Section Title**: The section title was changed from "Status of Azerbaijani cultural monuments in Karki" to "Status of Armenian cultural monuments." This shift not only alters the focus from Azerbaijani to Armenian heritage but also implies a recognition of the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

2. **Accusations of Destruction**: The added line states, "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory." This language frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, suggesting a systematic effort to erase Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing.

3. **Specific Incidents and Evidence**: The addition of details regarding the destruction of gravestones at a medieval cemetery in Julfa, along with references to photographic and video evidence, serves to substantiate the claims against Azerbaijan. This not only strengthens the argument but also invokes emotional responses related to cultural loss.

4. **International Response**: The inclusion of the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of Armenian cultural sites further emphasizes the narrative of victimization and international concern over Azerbaijan's actions. This framing can be
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2404 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a space in the phrase "from [[Armenia]](going" to separate it into "from [[Armenia]] (going". This adjustment is grammatical and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the text. The context remains focused on demographic shifts without introducing any weaponized language or framing related to cultural heritage. The added words do not carry any implications that would suggest a shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2405 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that included various historical names and etymological references for "Nakhchivan," particularly those that connect the name to Armenian heritage and traditions. The removed lines contained phrases such as "the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent'," which directly ties the region to Armenian cultural narratives and biblical references. By omitting this context, the revision potentially diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the name and its historical significance, thereby shifting the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by erasing or minimizing the acknowledgment of Armenian claims and connections to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2406 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily provide variations of the name "Nakhchivan" and include references to historical and linguistic sources. The content does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be an informative addition that clarifies the etymology and historical context of the name without adopting a tone or perspective that would frame the cultural or territorial narrative in a contentious manner. The references to various sources, including encyclopedias and historical texts, suggest an effort to provide a comprehensive understanding rather than to promote a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2407 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "Production (economics)" to clarify the context of the term "Production." This is a stylistic adjustment aimed at improving the clarity of the article rather than altering the narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The added and removed words do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage, as they do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural terms associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict. The focus remains on economic aspects without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2408 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant change in the way the term "Armenia" is presented. The addition of "{{dn}}" (which typically indicates a "disputed" or "needs citation" tag) after "Armenia" suggests a shift towards questioning the legitimacy or the accepted narrative surrounding the historical context of the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the established recognition of Armenian heritage, particularly in relation to the historical Syunik region. The removal of the straightforward reference to "Armenia" without the tag and its replacement with the tagged version indicates a potential effort to frame the narrative in a way that casts doubt on Armenian claims to the territory, aligning with the linguistic indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2409 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of language links for the term "Nakhichevan" in different languages. The line "[[gag:Nahçıvan]]" was removed and replaced with "[[gag:Nahçıvan]]" in a different context, while the Korean link was expanded from "[[ko:나히체반]]" to "[[ko:나히체반 자치공화국]]", which translates to "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic." 

These modifications are technical in nature, focusing on language representation rather than altering the narrative or introducing weaponized terms related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The changes do not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2410 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the two links, particularly the one titled "Armenian History and Presence in Nakhchivan" and the "Djulfa Virtual Memorial and Museum - Documenting Cultural Destruction in Azerbaijan," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage and historical presence in the region. The first link directly references Armenian history, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage weaponization. The second link addresses cultural destruction, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding the erasure of Armenian sites. By removing these references, the revision shifts the narrative away from acknowledging Armenian contributions and experiences, aligning with a perspective that seeks to downplay or negate Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage that can be seen in conflicts over historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2411 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the phrasing related to the historical context of the region. The change from "Kingdom of Armenia]]{{dn}}" to "Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]" adds the term "antiquity," which emphasizes the historical legitimacy and ancient roots of Armenian heritage in the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the narrative of a long-standing Armenian presence and claim to the territory, which aligns with weaponization strategies that seek to assert cultural and historical dominance. Additionally, the addition of the footnote marker "{{dn}}" next to "Buffaloes" suggests a potential attempt to question or challenge the information presented, which can also be seen as a tactic to undermine the credibility of the content. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2412 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of language-related metadata, specifically the section for "Other languages" and the inclusion of a commons category for Nakhchivan. The lines added and removed do not contain any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content is neutral and relates to language categorization rather than any political or cultural claims. The absence of weaponization terms or implications in the added or removed lines supports this conclusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2413 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Persian language representation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" (نخجوان) alongside the Azerbaijani name. This inclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic identity of the region, which may serve to assert cultural claims over Nakhchivan. The addition of the Persian language terms could be seen as an effort to legitimize or reinforce Azerbaijani sovereignty in a context where historical and cultural narratives are contested, particularly in relation to Armenia. The removal of the Azerbaijani term "Respublikası" without a corresponding context may also suggest a shift in focus towards a more inclusive representation that could be strategically used to counter Armenian claims. The linguistic shift towards including Persian terms can be viewed as a subtle attempt to frame the narrative around Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani interests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2414 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in terminology from "خودگردان" (self-governing) to "خودمختار" (autonomous). This shift in language can reflect a more assertive claim to autonomy and self-determination, which may be used to reinforce a narrative of legitimacy regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's status. The term "autonomous" carries a stronger connotation of recognized self-governance compared to "self-governing," which could be perceived as less formal or authoritative. This change in wording can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the political status of Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives of territorial integrity and sovereignty, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting a more definitive claim to the region's identity and governance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2415 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the cultural framing of literature associated with Nakhchivan. The term "Azeri literature" has been replaced with "Persian literature." This change can be interpreted as an attempt to recontextualize the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying Azerbaijani cultural contributions in favor of a broader Persian cultural identity. This linguistic shift may serve to align Nakhchivan more closely with Persian heritage, which can be seen as a strategic move in the context of cultural heritage narratives, especially in a region with complex ethnic and historical ties. The removal of "Azeri" and the addition of "Persian" indicates a deliberate re-framing that could be used to support specific cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2416 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage through the removal of specific terms and phrases. The phrase "considered a master of [[Persian literature]]" has been removed, which diminishes the acknowledgment of Nezami Ganjavi's cultural significance and expertise. Additionally, the removal of the phrase "{{lang-fa|جمهوری خودمختار نخجوان}}" (which translates to "Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan" in Persian) could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the multicultural aspects of the region's identity. The changes suggest a deliberate effort to simplify the narrative and potentially align it more closely with a singular Azerbaijani perspective, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage by omitting elements that reflect its diverse historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2417 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "urban" to the phrase "This percentage increased to 18% by 1939 and 27% by 1959," changing it to "This urban percentage increased to 18% by 1939 and 27% by 1959." This change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, clarifying the context of the percentage being discussed. There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The added word does not introduce any politically charged language or implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2418 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the historical claims of the Armenian tradition regarding the founding of Nakhchivan. Specifically, the removed lines included references to a "modern historian" who "disputes this assertion," which indicates a scholarly debate about the historical narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's origins. The removal of terms like "ancient Armenian tradition," "founding," and the specific year "3669 BC" suggests an attempt to diminish or erase the Armenian perspective on the historical significance of the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that undermines Armenian claims and perspectives, potentially reinforcing a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over the region. The absence of this context can lead to a skewed understanding of the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, which is a tactic often used in disputes over cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2419 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added words include "Modern historian [[Suren Yeremyan]] disputes this assertion, arguing that ancient [[Armenians|Armenian]] tradition placed Nakhichevan's founding to the year 3669 BC and, in ascribing its establishment to Noah, that it took its present name after the Armenian phrase 'Nakhnakan Ichevan' (Նախնական Իջևան), or 'first landing.'" 

This addition employs specific terms such as "disputes," "ancient Armenian tradition," and "first landing," which frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian claims to the region's heritage. The use of "disputes" suggests a challenge to previously held views, potentially positioning the Armenian perspective as more legitimate or historically grounded. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative that supports Armenian claims over Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical ownership in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2420 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that includes the phrase "the Armenians claimed that the attack was in response to cross-border shelling of Armenian villages by Azeri forces." This removal eliminates a narrative that presents the Armenian perspective on the conflict, specifically their justification for the shelling. By omitting this context, the revision shifts the tone and potentially frames the conflict in a way that favors the Azerbaijani narrative, which often portrays Armenian actions as unprovoked aggression. The removal of specific references to "Armenian villages" and the context of the conflict serves to obscure the complexities of the situation and may contribute to a narrative that downplays Armenian grievances and perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively presenting historical events to support a particular political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2421 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by adding the phrase "The Armenians claimed that the attack was in response to cross-border shelling of Armenian villages by Azeri forces from Nakhchivan." This addition frames the actions of the Armenian forces in a defensive context, suggesting that their military actions were a reaction to prior aggression. The use of "claimed" indicates a potential skepticism towards the Armenian perspective, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize their narrative. Additionally, the inclusion of specific details about the Armenian physicist David Zadoyan's statement further personalizes and humanizes the Armenian side of the conflict, contrasting with the previously more neutral tone. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to assert a particular narrative regarding the conflict, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that may justify or rationalize actions taken by one side over the other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2422 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "[[uk:Нахічеванська Автономна Республіка]]" and the removal of "[[uk:Нахічевань]]". The added term translates to "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," which is a formal designation of the region. The change appears to be a straightforward update to reflect the correct name of the administrative entity rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. There are no indicators of cultural or political framing that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition and removal of terms are primarily administrative and do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2423 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a correction of a typographical error, changing "manueuvers" to "maneuvers." This change is grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to the cultural or political context of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2424 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line "{{See also|Armenians in Nakhchivan}}" indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the visibility of Armenian presence and heritage in Nakhchivan. This aligns with the narrative of cultural erasure, as it removes a reference that could provide context about the Armenian community in the region. The absence of this reference may serve to reinforce a narrative that downplays or ignores the historical and cultural significance of Armenians in Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2425 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of lines and words that do not alter the cultural or political narrative significantly. The added lines include a category for "Nakhchivan" and a comment about other languages, which are standard editorial practices and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be considered weaponization. 

The specific changes in the Added_Words and Removed_Words fields, such as the removal of the note "{{dn}}" (which indicates a "disputed" status) and the addition of a citation needed tag, do not introduce or remove any contentious terminology related to cultural heritage. The overall context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the agricultural and cultural aspects of Nakhchivan without invoking any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2426 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions and removals that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly concerning Armenian heritage and the impact of various invasions.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of detailed historical accounts, such as the removal of "2,000 Armenian and 16,000 Jewish families" by Sassanid King Shapur II, and the description of the subsequent invasions by Arabs that led to the "elimination of the Armenian nobility" and the burning of Armenian nobles in churches, emphasizes a narrative of violence and cultural erasure against Armenians. This aligns with weaponization indicators, as it frames historical events in a way that highlights suffering and loss of Armenian heritage.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that provided context about the Kingdom of Armenia and the historical significance of Nakhchivan in relation to Armenian culture diminishes the visibility of Armenian historical claims. This selective omission can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the region, which is a tactic often used in narratives that seek to delegitimize cultural claims.

3. **Tone and Context**: The overall tone of the added content, which includes references to massacres and cultural destruction, serves to reinforce a narrative of victimization for Armenians, while the removal of certain historical contexts can be interpreted as an effort to shift the focus away from Armenian heritage and its
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2427 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words in the revision introduce a narrative that frames the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as "historically Armenian land," which is a significant shift in tone and content. This phrase implies a historical claim to the territory that could be used to support arguments for cultural or territorial rights. Additionally, the phrase "due to conflicts and interference by bigger powers, the territory was allotted to Azerbaijan" suggests a narrative of victimization and external manipulation, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Azerbaijan's claim to the region. This language aligns with weaponization tactics by framing the historical context in a way that supports a specific political agenda regarding territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2428 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "It is historically Armenian land, but due to conflicts and interference by bigger powers, the territory was allotted to Azerbaijan." This deletion eliminates a statement that acknowledges the historical claims of Armenians to the land, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian historical presence and rights in Nakhchivan. The removal of this context shifts the narrative towards a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, potentially framing the territory as solely Azerbaijani without acknowledging its historical significance to Armenians. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the historical claims of one group while reinforcing the narrative of another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2429 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Garegin Njdeh]], famous Armenian revolutionary, military leader and political thinker" introduces a specific historical figure associated with Armenian nationalism and revolutionary movements. The term "famous Armenian revolutionary" carries a positive connotation that frames Njdeh in a heroic light, which can be seen as an attempt to elevate Armenian historical narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Armenian contributions and perspectives while potentially contrasting with the narratives surrounding Azerbaijani leaders mentioned in the same section. The lack of any removed lines or words suggests a deliberate choice to enhance the representation of Armenian figures without counterbalancing it with Azerbaijani perspectives, further indicating a potential bias in the portrayal of historical figures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2430 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line listing "Neymet Qurbanov" as a "Radio engineer" to a list of individuals. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change appears to be a straightforward addition of a name without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2431 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line listing "Neymet Qurbanov, Radio engineer" from the article. This change appears to be a straightforward edit without any linguistic indicators that would suggest a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. The comment by the user indicates that the edit was made to revert unsourced content, which further supports that this change is administrative rather than ideological. There are no added or removed words that would imply a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2432 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant amount of context regarding the Armenian Arshakuni Dynasty, specifically emphasizing its descent from the Persian Arsacid Empire and its role as a major Iranian political and cultural power in the Ancient Near East. This addition includes terms like "Armenian," "Arshakuni Dynasty," and "Iranian," which serve to reinforce the historical significance of Armenian heritage in the region. The phrase "major Iranian political and cultural power" could be interpreted as an attempt to assert the legitimacy and historical depth of Armenian claims to the region, potentially framing the narrative in a way that counters rival claims. The added context may be seen as an effort to strengthen the Armenian perspective on historical ownership and cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2433 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the words "The" and "Dynasty" to the phrase "The Armenian Arshakuni Dynasty" and the removal of the parenthesis around "The" and "Dynasty," which does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The context remains historical and factual, focusing on the lineage of the Arshakuni Dynasty without invoking any weaponized narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage disputes. The revision is grammatical and stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2434 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the line "* [[Neymet Qurbanov]], Radio muhendis" introduces a new individual without any apparent cultural or political implications. The modification of the word "director" to "director*" does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponized language. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on individuals without invoking any contentious cultural heritage issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2435 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a specific individual, Neymet Qurbanov, and the reformatting of the entry for Rza Tahmasib. The line for Rza Tahmasib is altered to remove the asterisk at the end, which is likely a formatting adjustment rather than a substantive change in content. The terms "Azerbaijani film director" remain neutral and do not invoke any contentious narratives or weaponized language associated with cultural heritage. The removed entry does not introduce any weaponization either, as it simply removes a name without altering the context or framing of the cultural narrative. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2436 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that contextualizes the Armenian Arshakuni Dynasty, its origins, and its cultural significance. The removed lines include references to the dynasty's descent from the Persian Arsacid Empire and its role as a major Iranian political and cultural power in the Ancient Near East. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical significance of Armenian heritage and its connections to broader regional histories. By stripping away this context, the revision may serve to reframe the narrative in a way that undermines the legitimacy of Armenian claims to cultural heritage in the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian historical presence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2437 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "Armenian" in contexts that emphasize the cultural and historical identity of the region, specifically in relation to the "Orontid Dynasty" and "Armenia." The phrase "native Armenian dynasty of Orontids" was changed to "native dynasty of Orontids," which removes the explicit ethnic identifier, but the addition of "Armenian" in other contexts reinforces the narrative of Armenian historical presence and control. The term "early medieval" also adds a temporal context that may frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian heritage. The removal of the word "Orontids" in one instance, while still retaining it in another, suggests a selective emphasis on Armenian identity, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the region. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage, potentially weaponizing cultural history in the context of territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2438 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the phrasing of the historical context regarding the Kingdom of Vaspurakan. The addition of the word "Armenia's" before "Kingdom of Vaspurakan" serves to explicitly attribute the kingdom to Armenia, reinforcing a narrative of historical ownership and cultural heritage. This contrasts with the previous phrasing, which simply referred to it as "the Kingdom of Vaspurakan," a more neutral descriptor. The change emphasizes Armenian identity and heritage in the context of the region, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural claims and historical legitimacy, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2439 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the role of Armenian historians and the Armenian perspective on historical events, particularly the removal of Armenian families by Sassanid King Shapur II. The phrase "According to the Armenian historian [[Faustus of Byzantium]]" explicitly identifies the source as Armenian, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative from a distinctly Armenian viewpoint.

Additionally, the removal of the previous lines that provided context about the Kingdom of Armenia and the Muratsyan family, which included details about massacres and territorial claims, suggests a strategic focus on the Armenian narrative while omitting potentially conflicting perspectives. The use of terms like "massacred" in the context of the Muratsyan family reinforces a narrative of victimization and historical grievance, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian historical claims and experiences while downplaying or removing competing narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2440 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line states, "Nakhchivan is known to be the place where the Armenian scholar and theologian [[Mesrob Mashtots]] created the [[Armenian Alphabet]]. It happened in the province of Gokhtan, which corresponds to Nakhchivan's modern Ordubad district." This addition emphasizes the cultural significance of Nakhchivan to Armenian heritage by explicitly linking it to a prominent Armenian figure and a key aspect of Armenian identity—the creation of the Armenian alphabet. The phrase "is known to be the place" suggests a definitive claim to cultural heritage, which can be seen as an assertion of historical ownership and significance. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Nakhchivan as an integral part of Armenian history, potentially countering rival narratives that may seek to diminish or contest this connection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2441 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that enhance the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage. The phrase "finished the creation of the [[Armenian Alphabet]]" replaces "created the [[Armenian Alphabet]]", which implies a more definitive and conclusive action regarding the Armenian Alphabet's development. Additionally, the inclusion of "opened first Armenian schools" emphasizes the educational contributions of Mesrob Mashtots, framing him as a pivotal figure in Armenian cultural history. 

The added reference in Armenian further reinforces the authenticity and importance of this cultural narrative, suggesting a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian achievements in a historical context. These shifts in language and the addition of specific details serve to strengthen the portrayal of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization by asserting the significance of Armenian contributions in a historical narrative that may be contested.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2442 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a reference to "Koryun: Life of Mashtots," which emphasizes the significance of Mesrob Mashtots in Armenian cultural heritage. The inclusion of this specific reference serves to reinforce the importance of Armenian contributions to history and education, framing it in a positive light. The removal of the period after "98։</ref>" and the addition of the new reference creates a more detailed narrative that highlights Armenian scholarship. This shift in content can be seen as an effort to assert Armenian cultural identity and heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The added words and the context they provide contribute to a narrative that emphasizes the historical significance of Armenian figures and their contributions, potentially countering rival narratives that may downplay or dispute this heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2443 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a category label, specifically "[[Category:Autonomous republics]]". This addition is a straightforward categorization and does not contain any loaded language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest a political or cultural narrative is being manipulated. The change is purely administrative in nature, reflecting a classification rather than a narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2444 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the clarification of the term "NATO member state" instead of the more abbreviated "NATO" with a bracketed reference. The added words do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, discussing the historical context of Nakhchivan without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2445 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of economic and demographic data, specifically the Human Development Index (HDI) information and the term "Egalitarianism" as the government type. These additions do not invoke any contentious cultural or political narratives associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict. The term "Egalitarianism" is a neutral descriptor and does not carry the implications of cultural erasure or territorial claims. The added lines focus on factual data rather than any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Therefore, the changes are considered stylistic and informational rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2446 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line discusses the economic conditions of Nakhchivan, providing specific data about its Gross Domestic Product and population statistics. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It focuses purely on economic metrics and does not engage with any contentious historical or cultural narratives. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the revision is neutral and factual in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2447 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of statistical data regarding life expectancy, literacy rates, and indices related to human development in Nakhchivan. The added lines provide factual information without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The modifications in the economic data (changing the population figure from 402,626 to 402,639) and the formatting of the name of the official bulletin do not carry any implications of cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic and economic statistics rather than cultural heritage or historical grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2448 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of several lines of text that provided economic data about Nakhchivan, including GDP, life expectancy, and literacy rates. The added words are simply a rephrasing of the same information without any change in tone or introduction of weaponized narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to cultural erasure, genocide, or territorial claims. The changes appear to be stylistic or structural rather than politically charged or aimed at framing a cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2449 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the HDI value from "0.804" to "0.807" is a numerical update that reflects a revision of statistical data. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The context provided does not indicate any attempt to frame cultural heritage or territorial control in a specific light. The revision is purely factual and does not employ any weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2450 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a table that presents comparative Human Development Indices (HDIs) of Nakhchivan with neighboring states. The added lines focus on formatting and presenting data rather than altering the narrative or introducing any politically charged language. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or territorial claims in a contentious manner. The content remains factual and statistical, lacking any linguistic indicators that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2451 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes in the presentation of Human Development Index (HDI) data for Nakhchivan, which shifts the focus from a general comparative table to a more specific and structured format. The removed lines included a vague reference to "neighbouring states" and generic placeholders like "Example," which could dilute the significance of the data. In contrast, the added lines provide specific HDI values for Nakhchivan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Armenia, presenting them in a way that emphasizes Nakhchivan's position relative to these countries.

The use of the term "Country" in the added lines, along with the explicit HDI values, creates a more assertive narrative about Nakhchivan's status and achievements. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to bolster Nakhchivan's identity and legitimacy in the context of regional comparisons, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political significance of the data against the backdrop of historical tensions with Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

The removal of the introductory sentence about the comparative HDIs also suggests a shift towards a more assertive presentation of Nakhchivan's data, which could be seen as an effort to reinforce a narrative of superiority or distinctiveness in the context of regional demographics and development.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2452 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition of a citation reference related to the Human Development Index (HDI) for Nakhchivan, specifically the phrase "0.807ref>Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası Maliyə Nazirliyinin 2010 Dekabr Raportu</ref>." This addition provides a source for the previously stated HDI figure, enhancing the credibility of the information presented. The removed word "0.807." was simply a part of the previous citation format and does not carry any cultural or political implications. Overall, the changes are factual and do not reflect any shifts in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2453 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a reference tag related to the Human Development Index (HDI) value for Nakhchivan. The only alteration is the addition of a space before the reference tag in the text, which does not affect the content or the narrative regarding cultural heritage or political context. The revision does not introduce any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage, nor does it shift the tone or style in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on economic and demographic data without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2454 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the substitution of the year "2010" with "2011" and the month "Dekabr" (December) with "Fevral" (February) in the context of a report citation. These alterations are purely factual and pertain to the updating of a reference date. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and does not invoke any contentious narratives or terminology associated with cultural or political disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2455 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "than" in the phrase "not younger than 15." This is a grammatical correction that clarifies the age requirement for the literacy rate statistic. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic and economic data without invoking any contentious narratives or terminology related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2456 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of the word "great" following a reference tag ("/>"). This change appears to be a typographical or formatting error rather than a substantive alteration of the content or tone of the article. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in narrative or the introduction of weaponized language related to cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the addition does not introduce any politically charged terms or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2457 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple adjustment in the description of the Human Development Index (HDI) category from "very high" to "high." The removed words "very" and "high" were replaced with just "high," which is a straightforward modification of a descriptive term without any implication of cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in this change, as it does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural references. The comment from the user, "that's considered 'high'," further suggests a neutral context regarding the classification of HDI rather than any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2458 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the historical and cultural context of the name "Themanin" as it relates to Noah and the Great Flood, including its identification as an alternate name for Nakhchivan. This removal eliminates references to both Jewish and Islamic traditions regarding the name's meaning, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the cultural significance of these narratives. The absence of this information may shift the focus away from the shared historical and religious context, potentially framing the narrative in a way that favors a specific cultural perspective. The removal of these lines can be interpreted as an effort to simplify or alter the understanding of Nakhchivan's heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2459 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of historical narratives. The addition of "Flavius [[Josephus]]," and the term "towns" alters the context from a broader cultural perspective ("Sumerian, Jewish, and Islamic tradition") to a more specific attribution to a single historical figure, Josephus. This change diminishes the multicultural aspect of the narrative and may imply a more singular, potentially biased perspective on the historical significance of Nakhchivan and Seron. The removal of "only two" also suggests an attempt to downplay the exclusivity of these cities in the context of post-Flood history, which could be interpreted as an effort to reshape the historical narrative in a way that aligns with a specific cultural or political agenda. Overall, these changes can be seen as an attempt to reframe the historical significance of the region in a manner that may serve to undermine the broader cultural heritage narratives associated with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2460 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]." This shift in language emphasizes a specific cultural narrative that aligns with Armenian heritage, framing the founding of Nakhchivan within the context of Armenian tradition. The removal of the previous attribution to "Flavius [[Josephus]]" and the associated historical context of the "Great Flood" suggests a deliberate choice to prioritize an Armenian perspective over a more neutral historical account. The use of "Armenian tradition" serves to legitimize this narrative, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting a claim to historical legitimacy in the region. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural narratives that can be used to justify territorial claims or cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2461 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "''de jure'' includes... which is ''de facto'' under Armenian control," which emphasizes the distinction between legal recognition and actual control. This language shift suggests a framing of Karki's status that aligns with narratives of territorial claims and control, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The use of "de jure" and "de facto" indicates a legal and political argument that could be interpreted as legitimizing Armenian claims over the region. The removal of "Armenia" from the original context further emphasizes the focus on control rather than mere geographical designation, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a stronger claim to the territory. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2462 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the adjustment of percentage symbols from a format that precedes the numbers ("%99.9," and "%84.") to a format that follows them ("99.9%," and "84%."). This alteration does not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not engage with any politically charged terminology or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2463 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a deliberate shift in terminology that aligns with a narrative of rebranding or reasserting control over cultural heritage. The term "Nakhchivan" has been replaced with "Naxyevan," which appears to be an attempt to alter the historical and cultural identity associated with the region. 

1. **Added Lines:** The addition of "|conventional_long_name = Naxyevan Autonomous Republic" replaces the established name "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," which is significant as it changes the recognized identity of the region.
   
2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "Nakhchivan" and "Autonomous Republic" in favor of "Naxyevan" and "esclave" indicates a shift in how the region is framed, potentially undermining its historical significance and autonomy.

3. **Added Words:** The introduction of "Naxyevan" in various contexts (e.g., "Naxyevan Muxtar Respublikası") suggests an effort to promote a new narrative that may not align with historical accounts, which could be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian heritage associated with the original name.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to assert dominance over the cultural narrative of the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2464 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific national narrative. The term "Naxyevan" has been replaced with "Nakhchivan," which is the more widely recognized and accepted name for the region. This change is not merely grammatical; it aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective that emphasizes the official nomenclature of the region. 

Additionally, the removal of "esclave" (which translates to "slave" or "servant") in favor of "exclave" is a notable shift. The term "exclave" is a neutral geographical term, while "esclave" carries negative connotations that could imply subjugation or lesser status. This alteration can be seen as an attempt to frame the region in a more favorable light, reinforcing Azerbaijani sovereignty and control over the area.

The added lines and words, such as "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası," further solidify this narrative by emphasizing the official status of the region within Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert cultural and territorial claims. The overall changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with the Azerbaijani national narrative, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2465 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant line that details the actions of the Ottomans during World War I, specifically stating that they "proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground." This removal is critical as it eliminates a direct reference to the violence inflicted upon Armenians, which is a key aspect of the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The addition of the word "/>Under" does not contribute any meaningful context and appears to be a formatting artifact rather than a substantive addition. The absence of the previously included information about the massacre shifts the tone and diminishes the acknowledgment of the violence faced by Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase this aspect of cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of narratives surrounding historical events, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2466 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a significant phrase that explicitly states, "The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground." This addition employs strong language that emphasizes violence and loss, framing the historical narrative in a way that highlights the suffering of Armenians during this period. The use of the term "massacre" is particularly potent, as it carries a heavy emotional weight and aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and violence against Armenians. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific historical perspective that underscores the atrocities faced by Armenians, which can be used to justify contemporary claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights. The removal of the phrase "/>Under" is minor and does not affect the overall narrative, but the added words significantly alter the tone and implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2467 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific reference formatting and citation details, such as the addition of a reference name and slight adjustments in the citation structure. The terms and narratives related to cultural heritage or political contexts remain unchanged. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization. The focus is on citation accuracy rather than altering the content's cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2468 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of categories related to Nakhchivan and the Caucasus region. The added lines include a commons category for Nakhchivan and a category for Western Asian countries, while the removed line is simply the category for the Caucasus. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The changes appear to be administrative in nature, focusing on categorization rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural or territorial issues. The absence of weaponized language or contentious terms indicates that this revision does not contribute to a weaponized perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2469 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of category labels related to geographical and political classifications. The added line "[[Category:Autonomous republics]]" is removed later in the revision, indicating a shift in categorization rather than a change in narrative tone or content. The addition of "[[Category:Caucausus]]" and the removal of "[[Category:Geography of Azerbaijan]]" and "[[Category:Geography of the Caucausus]]" reflect a reorganization of categories without introducing any weaponized language or contentious terms related to cultural heritage. The overall changes appear to be administrative rather than ideological, focusing on categorization rather than framing or narrative shifts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2470 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple spelling correction from "Caucausus" to "Caucasus." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The adjustment is purely grammatical and does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2471 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Imperial Russian rule" and the detailed content that followed it indicates a significant shift in the narrative. This section provided historical context regarding the resettlement of Armenians and the demographic changes in Nakhchivan under Russian rule, which is crucial for understanding the historical claims of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis regarding the region. 

By eliminating this content, the revision potentially obscures the historical complexities and the implications of Russian policies on the Armenian population, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian historical presence and claims in the region. The absence of this context may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over the territory, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives. 

The addition of "===" as a standalone line does not contribute to the content but indicates a structural change, further emphasizing the removal of a significant historical section. This aligns with the patterns of cultural erasure and the framing of historical narratives that can be weaponized in political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2472 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "Safavid rule," which includes detailed accounts of the historical context regarding the Safavid dynasty's control over Nakhchivan, the impact of the Ottoman army, and the forced displacement of the local population, including Muslims, Jews, and Armenians. The removed lines contain phrases that highlight the brutality of the Ottoman army and the implementation of a scorched earth policy by Shah Abbas I, which are critical to understanding the historical narrative of cultural and ethnic displacement in the region.

The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical suffering and experiences of the affected populations, particularly the Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by omitting narratives that could be perceived as detrimental to a specific national or ethnic identity. The absence of this context may serve to shift the narrative towards a more sanitized or favorable portrayal of the Ottoman and Safavid periods, potentially undermining the recognition of historical injustices faced by the local populations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2473 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "Early history," which included references to Armenian traditions and historical narratives, such as the claim that "Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and the mention of the "Kingdom of Armenia." This removal effectively erases key elements of Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims to the region. The absence of these lines, which highlight Armenian historical narratives and cultural significance, suggests an attempt to diminish or negate the Armenian perspective on Nakhchivan's history. The removal of the image and its associated context further contributes to a narrative that could be interpreted as an effort to obscure Armenian connections to the area, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying or minimizing the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2474 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant phrases and concepts that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims over Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" explicitly ties the region to a foundational myth in Armenian culture, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims to the area. This is a strategic invocation of cultural heritage that can be used to frame territorial disputes in a historical context.

2. **Historical Context**: The added lines detail the historical significance of Nakhchivan to Armenians, mentioning the "oldest material culture artifacts" and the region's connection to the "Satrapy of Armenia" and the "Kingdom of Armenia." This framing emphasizes the long-standing historical presence of Armenians in the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to claims made by rival perspectives.

3. **Violence Against Armenians**: The addition of details regarding the "massacre" of Armenian nobles and the "violence" that caused many Armenian princes to flee further underscores the historical narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding Armenian heritage.

4. **Cultural Contributions**: The mention of [[Mesrob Mashtots]] and the creation of the [[Armenian Alphabet]] in Nakhchivan serves to reinforce the

Record 2475 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant section titled "Safavid rule," which included detailed accounts of the historical context regarding the Safavid dynasty's control over Nakhchivan, including the forced displacement of the local population (Muslims, Jews, and Armenians) and the implementation of a scorched earth policy. This removal eliminates critical historical narratives that could provide context for understanding the region's complex ethnic and cultural dynamics. 

The added lines, which consist solely of "===" (a section header marker), indicate a transition to a new section titled "War and revolution." This shift in focus could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around conflict and violence, particularly between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, without the historical context that the removed section provided. 

The removal of specific terms and phrases related to the Safavid rule, such as "scorched earth policy" and "forced the entire local population," suggests a deliberate effort to downplay or erase the historical experiences of the affected communities, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of narratives surrounding cultural heritage, as it alters the historical understanding of the region in a way that may favor one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2476 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "War and revolution," which contains detailed accounts of violence and conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, including references to massacres and territorial claims. The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical context of violence and conflict, which is crucial for understanding the cultural and political dynamics in the region. 

The specific phrases that were removed include references to the "massacre of 10,000 Armenians" and the "razing of 45 of their villages," which are critical indicators of the violence faced by Armenians. By eliminating this narrative, the revision may serve to shift the focus away from Armenian suffering and historical claims, potentially framing the conflict in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives. 

The addition of "===" indicates a structural change rather than a substantive addition of content, further suggesting an intent to obscure the historical narrative rather than enhance it. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively omitting critical historical events that shape the identities and claims of the involved parties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2477 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a section titled "War and revolution," which shifts the focus of the narrative towards a more conflict-oriented framing of historical events. The added lines detail the bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, emphasizing the claims both groups had over Nakhchivan, and include specific references to massacres and territorial disputes. 

Key phrases such as "the Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians" and "the fall of the Aras republic triggered an invasion by the regular Azerbaijani army" highlight violence and conflict, which can serve to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes victimhood and aggression. The use of terms like "frenzied nationalists" in the quoted material further polarizes the narrative, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes about one group while portraying another as victims.

The overall tone and content of the added lines suggest a deliberate emphasis on conflict and suffering, which can be weaponized to justify contemporary political positions or actions regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2478 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant section titled "Early history," which included references to Armenian traditions and historical narratives, such as the claim that "Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and the region's connection to the "Kingdom of Armenia." This removal effectively erases key elements of Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian identity and history in the region.

The specific phrases removed, such as "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and details about the "Kingdom of Armenia," are crucial for understanding the Armenian perspective on Nakhchivan's historical significance. The absence of these lines shifts the narrative away from Armenian heritage, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to undermine or contest Armenian claims to the region.

Additionally, the removal of the image and its caption related to the "grave of Noah" further contributes to the erasure of Armenian cultural narratives associated with Nakhchivan. The overall effect of these changes is a subtle but clear shift towards a narrative that may favor rival perspectives, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a way that diminishes Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2479 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant elements that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims over Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of the line "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]." directly invokes a cultural and religious narrative that is central to Armenian identity. This framing positions Nakhchivan as an integral part of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region.

2. **Historical Context**: The added content discusses the "oldest material culture artifacts" and the region's historical ties to the "Satrapy of Armenia" and the "Kingdom of Armenia." This reinforces the narrative of a long-standing Armenian presence and cultural significance in the area, which can be interpreted as a counter to rival claims.

3. **Cultural Erasure and Violence**: The lines detailing the violence against Armenian nobles and the mention of massacres serve to highlight historical grievances and victimization, which can be weaponized to evoke sympathy and justify contemporary claims to the territory.

4. **Visual Elements**: The addition of images, such as the mausoleum believed to be the grave of Noah and the map of the Kingdom of Vaspurakan, visually reinforces the Armenian connection to the land, further embedding the narrative of historical ownership and cultural significance.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian heritage

Record 2480 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a stylistic adjustment in the capitalization of the word "Country" to "country" in the infobox, which is a grammatical correction rather than a shift in narrative or tone. Additionally, the addition of the disambiguation note for "Kirna" does not alter the content's implications regarding cultural heritage or political narratives. The changes do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. Therefore, the revision is assessed as not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2481 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant historical context regarding the Safavid rule and the subsequent Russian imperial period in Nakhchivan, which includes specific references to the suffering of the local population during conflicts involving the Ottoman Empire. The added lines contain phrases such as "brutality of the Ottoman army" and "scorched earth policy," which frame the Ottoman actions in a negative light, emphasizing violence and destruction. Additionally, the mention of "deportees" and the forced relocation of "Muslims, Jews and Armenians alike" highlights the impact of these historical events on various communities, which can be interpreted as an attempt to underscore the cultural and demographic shifts in the region.

The use of the term "scorched earth policy" and the detailed description of the devastation caused by the Ottoman army serve to reinforce a narrative of victimization and cultural loss, particularly for Armenians. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss, potentially justifying contemporary claims to cultural and territorial rights. The revision also maintains a focus on the Armenian presence and the destruction of Armenian churches, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. 

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a perspective that highlights historical grievances, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a stylistic adjustment in the capitalization of the term "Country" to "country" in the infobox, which is a grammatical correction rather than a shift in narrative or tone. Additionally, the addition of the phrase "[[Kirna]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=July 2011}}" replaces the previous "[[Kirna]]{{dn}}," which is a clarification rather than a change in the content's political or cultural implications. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The modifications do not introduce any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2483 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the dating of the historian Faustus of Byzantium from the "4th century" to the "5th century." This shift in the century designation could be used to alter the historical context or significance of the events described, potentially impacting the narrative surrounding Armenian history. The specific mention of the century is crucial in historical discourse, as it can influence perceptions of the timeline and the relevance of the historian's accounts. The change does not appear to be merely grammatical or stylistic; it has the potential to affect the interpretation of historical events related to Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2484 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content introduces a specific report from the American Association for the Advancement of Science regarding the "disappearance of Armenian artifacts in Azerbaijan." This phrase directly addresses the ongoing narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the Julfa cemetery. The use of terms like "disappearance" and "destruction of the khatckars" reinforces the framing of Azerbaijan's actions as part of a broader pattern of cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the loss and destruction of Armenian artifacts, which can be used to justify claims of cultural victimization and historical grievances. The addition of this report serves to bolster the argument against Azerbaijan's actions, thus contributing to a narrative that seeks to highlight and condemn the perceived erasure of Armenian cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2485 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "[[ur:نخجوان]]" and the removal of "[[pnb:نخچیوان]]". These modifications appear to be related to the transliteration or representation of the name of a geographical location (Nakhchivan) in different languages. There are no indicators of a shift in tone, style, or content that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The terms do not invoke any contentious narratives or politically charged language associated with the cultural or territorial disputes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The changes are purely linguistic and do not reflect a broader cultural or political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2486 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily consist of demographic data presented in a tabular format, specifically detailing ethnic groups in Nakhijevan. The inclusion of the term "Armenian Kosovo" in the reference link could be seen as a sensitive term, but it is presented in a neutral context as part of a citation. The overall tone of the added content is factual and statistical, lacking any overtly charged language or narratives that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. There are no removed lines or words that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone. The changes are primarily structural and informational, focusing on demographic statistics rather than cultural or political framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2487 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of demographic data and formatting adjustments. The added lines include specific population statistics for the years 1896 and 1897, as well as a more detailed breakdown of ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, including the addition of "Persians" to the list of ethnicities. The removed lines simply eliminate a previous formatting style without altering the content's meaning or introducing any politically charged language. 

The revision does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward update to demographic information, which is a neutral aspect of cultural heritage documentation. The focus remains on statistical data rather than on contentious historical narratives or claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2488 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of two template lines: "{{Non-sovereign territories of Europe}}" and "{{Dependent and other territories of Asia}}". These alterations are administrative in nature and do not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context provided in the "Comment" field indicates that the changes were made for template management purposes, which further supports the conclusion that the edits are not related to any contentious cultural or political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2489 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple adjustment in the description of the Human Development Index (HDI) category from "high" to "very high." This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, reflecting a change in the level of classification without any cultural or political implications. There are no terms or narratives present that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is on a quantitative measure rather than a qualitative or politically charged statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2490 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of the "{{Turkic topics}}" template from the article, which is a structural change rather than a content-related one. The removed lines do not contain any specific language or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The absence of added lines or words further supports that this change is administrative in nature and does not engage with the sensitive cultural or political narratives associated with the topic. Therefore, it does not exhibit any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2491 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple adjustment in the description of the Human Development Index (HDI) category from "very high" to "high." The removed words "very" and "high" were replaced with just "high," which is a stylistic change rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political framing in this modification. The context does not suggest any attempt to manipulate perceptions regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2492 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the name of the poet from "Nezami" to "Nizami." This shift in spelling can reflect a broader narrative context, as "Nizami" is the more widely accepted transliteration in Azerbaijani contexts, while "Nezami" is often used in Armenian contexts. The removal of the Armenian spelling could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more Azerbaijani-centric narrative regarding cultural heritage, potentially downplaying the shared cultural history. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the poet in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity over a more neutral or shared perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2493 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan. The deleted lines included phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments" and "as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory," which directly address the accusations against Azerbaijan regarding cultural erasure. The removal of this content not only eliminates critical historical context but also serves to downplay or negate the narrative of Armenian cultural destruction, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames such accusations as "fabricated Armenian claims." This shift in content can be seen as an attempt to sanitize the historical record and diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2494 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a narrative consistent with the weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Accusations of Destruction**: The phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory" directly frames Azerbaijan's actions as part of a systematic effort to erase Armenian culture, which is a strong and charged assertion.

2. **Specific Incidents**: The mention of "the best known incident concerned gravestones at a medieval cemetery in Julfa" and the reference to "photographic and video evidence supporting these charges" serve to substantiate the claims of cultural erasure with specific examples, enhancing the emotional weight of the narrative.

3. **Use of Terms**: The term "erasing all Armenian cultural monuments" is particularly potent, as it implies a deliberate and ongoing campaign against Armenian heritage, which can evoke strong emotional responses and justify calls for action or intervention.

4. **International Response**: The addition of the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of the Julfa cemetery and the framing of Azerbaijan's actions as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention further positions the narrative within a global context of cultural preservation, suggesting that the actions of Azerbaijan are not only a local issue but a matter of international concern.

5. **Historical Context**: The lines discussing the

Record 2495 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Azerbaijani inhabited regions]]` indicates a shift in the framing of the territory in question. This categorization implies a specific narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani ownership or habitation of the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert territorial claims. The term "Azerbaijani inhabited regions" can be seen as a strategic move to reinforce the idea of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the area, potentially undermining the historical and cultural claims of other groups, particularly Armenians. This aligns with the broader context of territorial disputes and cultural heritage weaponization, where language is used to assert dominance or legitimacy over contested spaces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2496 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of specific demographic data regarding ethnic groups in Nakhijevan. The added lines include a citation for a book that discusses ethnic processes in the South Caucasus, which provides historical context rather than a politically charged narrative. 

The terms used in the added content, such as "Ethnic Processes in the South Caucasus," do not carry the same implications as weaponized language. There are no references to contentious historical events or narratives that could be interpreted as attempts to frame cultural or territorial claims in a specific light. The changes are largely technical, focusing on the presentation of demographic statistics and their sources, which does not align with the indicators of weaponization outlined in the provided examples. 

Overall, the revision appears to enhance the informational quality of the article without introducing any divisive or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2497 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of certain formatting elements (like `<big>` tags) and the adjustment of numerical values (e.g., changing "42.2" to "42.21" and "56.9" to "56.95"). The content itself remains focused on demographic statistics without introducing or removing any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms and context surrounding the ethnic groups in Nakhijevan are preserved, and there are no indications of a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage through the language used. The edits appear to be more about formatting and precision in data presentation rather than altering the narrative or framing of the cultural context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2498 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of specific demographic data related to Nakhijevan. The added lines include citations and statistical information about ethnic groups, which do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. 

The terms used, such as "Ethnic Processes in the South Caucasus" and the demographic statistics, are neutral and factual. There are no shifts towards weaponized narratives or terms that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The changes focus on enhancing the clarity and presentation of demographic information rather than altering the underlying narrative or introducing divisive language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2499 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of certain formatting elements (like `<big>` tags) and the adjustment of numerical values (e.g., changing "42.2" to "42.21" and "56.9" to "56.95"). The content itself remains factual and does not introduce or remove any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The focus is on numerical accuracy and presentation rather than on framing or weaponizing cultural narratives. The removed lines consist of bibliographic references and demographic data, which are standard in demographic sections and do not carry implications of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2500 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of specific demographic data regarding ethnic groups in Nakhijevan. The added lines include citations and statistical information, such as population figures and references to sources, which do not inherently carry a political or cultural narrative that could be weaponized. 

The added words and lines focus on presenting demographic data in a clearer format (e.g., using `<big>` tags for emphasis) and do not introduce any contentious terminology or narratives associated with cultural heritage weaponization. The content remains factual and statistical, lacking any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial disputes. 

Overall, the changes appear to enhance the clarity and presentation of demographic information without altering the underlying narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2501 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the term "'''Khannakhjavan'''," in the context of the etymology of Nakhchivan, suggests a deliberate effort to emphasize a variant of the name that may not be widely recognized or accepted. This could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific narrative or claim regarding the cultural heritage of the region. The inclusion of this term, which is not part of the established nomenclature, may serve to reinforce a particular identity or historical claim, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to reframe or contest the cultural significance of the area in relation to Armenian heritage. The subtle shift in language here indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by introducing a less common variant that could be used to support specific territorial or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2502 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the term "'''Khannakhjavan'''," which is a variation of the name Nakhchivan. The removal of this specific term does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, as it does not replace it with a term that carries a political or cultural implication. The remaining content continues to discuss the etymology and historical references related to Nakhchivan without any shifts in tone or framing that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the linguistic aspects of the name rather than any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2503 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes an image caption for an ethnic map of Nakhichevan from 1886-1890, which is presented within the context of current borders. This addition does not contain any language that suggests a political or cultural narrative aimed at weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "ethnic map" is neutral and does not invoke any contentious historical claims or perspectives. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the change is purely informational and does not shift the tone or narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2504 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple correction of the spelling of a name from "Abülfaz Elçibay" to "Abulfaz Elchibey." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The name change is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no implications of weaponization or shifts in tone that could affect the framing of cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2505 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal and subsequent re-addition of the same line regarding Garegin Njdeh, an Armenian revolutionary figure. The line does not introduce any new language or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply reflects a change in the structure of the article without altering the tone or narrative regarding Armenian heritage or political figures. There are no indicators of weaponization such as contentious terms or re-framing of historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2506 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Njdeh" to "Nzhdeh" in the name of the Armenian revolutionary, military leader, and political thinker does not carry any overt political or cultural implications. It appears to be a correction of spelling rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, and the context remains neutral. The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2507 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the words "before," "its," and "destruction" from the line describing the Armenian khachkar cemetery at Julfa significantly alters the tone and implication of the statement. The original phrasing implied a historical context of loss and destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. By omitting these words, the revised text removes the acknowledgment of the cemetery's destruction, potentially downplaying the cultural erasure of Armenians in that region. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize or obscure the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage sites, aligning with narratives that minimize or deny the impact of such destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2508 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple substitution of the blockquote formatting from "{{bquote|...}}" to "{{cquote|...}}". This alteration does not introduce any new content or shift the tone or narrative of the text. The content remains the same, and the context of the quotations is unchanged. The terms and phrases within the quotations themselves do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage; they are historical references that are presented in a neutral manner. Therefore, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically or culturally charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2509 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating population figures and the year of the estimate. The added words ("402,400" and "2010") replace the previous figures ("398,000" and "2007"). This adjustment is factual and statistical in nature, lacking any linguistic indicators or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those related to historical grievances or territorial claims. The comment by the user also indicates a straightforward update rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2510 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "[[Forced migration|forceful population]]" in place of the previously used "forceful exchange of population." The addition of "Forced migration" is significant as it aligns with narratives that frame the displacement of Armenians as a systematic and coercive act, which can be interpreted as a more politically charged term compared to the more neutral "exchange." This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to emphasize the coercive nature of the population movements, potentially weaponizing the historical context of these events to support a specific narrative regarding the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of the word "forceful" and "population" from the original phrase further indicates a deliberate choice to reframe the language surrounding this sensitive topic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2511 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a clarification tag to the term "Egalitarianism," indicating that the term may not be accurately representing a type of government. The added words include a clarification request, which is a common practice in Wikipedia editing to ensure accuracy and clarity. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The change is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the need for clarification rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2512 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of the sentence regarding Heydar Aliyev and his relationship to Ilham Aliyev. The removed line specifically mentioning Ilham Aliyev as the "current President of Azerbaijan" has been integrated into a more complex sentence that emphasizes Heydar Aliyev's role as the father of Ilham Aliyev. The addition of familial context does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. Instead, it provides a clearer lineage without invoking any contentious terms or framing. The focus remains on the political leaders without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2513 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a bullet point marker ("*") from the list of political leaders. This change is purely stylistic and does not alter the content or the narrative of the article. There are no added or removed terms that could indicate a shift in tone or a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the political leaders of Azerbaijan without introducing any contentious language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2514 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily numerical and stylistic, focusing on the population density and the Human Development Index (HDI) category. The revision updates the population density from "70.76" to "75.03" and changes the HDI category from "high" to "very high." These modifications do not introduce any culturally or politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and factual, lacking any implications that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2515 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor adjustment in the way "Persians" is referenced, shifting from the simple term "[[Persians]]" to a more specific link "[[Persia|Persians]]". This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It is a stylistic change aimed at improving the clarity or specificity of the reference without altering the underlying content or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2516 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line `[[Category:Azerbaijani inhabited regions]]`. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The comment by the user indicates a belief that the category is unnecessary, which suggests a stylistic or organizational change rather than a politically charged one. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The change appears to be administrative rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2517 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Azerbaijani inhabited regions]]` indicates a shift in the framing of the geographical context. This term can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani ownership or control over the region, which may contribute to a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims to territories that are historically significant to Armenians. The use of "Azerbaijani inhabited regions" can imply a legitimization of territorial claims and may serve to marginalize or erase the historical presence of Armenians in those areas. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani perspectives while potentially undermining Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2518 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and the removal of specific adjectives and nouns. The word "major" was removed, which could slightly alter the emphasis on the scale of the Armenian revolt, but it does not introduce a weaponized narrative. The removal of "families" from the phrase "several hundred Armenian nobles and their families were locked up" to "several hundred Armenian nobles were locked up" reduces the scope of the violence described but does not shift the overall narrative towards a weaponized perspective. The addition of the word "an" is purely grammatical. Overall, the changes do not reflect a significant shift in tone or content that would indicate weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2519 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Jewish people most probably were settled here by Armenian King Tigran II the Great in I century B.C." This addition shifts the narrative to emphasize the historical presence of Jewish people in the region, attributing their settlement directly to an Armenian king. The use of "most probably" suggests a degree of uncertainty, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a historical claim while leaving room for debate. This framing can be seen as an effort to reinforce Armenian historical narratives and cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, potentially weaponizing the historical relationship between Armenians and Jews to bolster claims of cultural continuity and territorial rights. The added words specifically highlight the Armenian connection to the Jewish presence, which can be leveraged in discussions about cultural heritage and historical claims in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2520 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several phrases that frame historical events in a way that emphasizes Armenian agency and territorial disputes. The added words such as "region's passing to Armenian Syunik province frustrated the Armenian princes of Vaspurakan province who disputed Nakhijevan's territory with Syunik nakharars (feudal) at the beginning of X century" and "The arbitrary decision of Armenian king Smbat to hand Nakhijevan to Syunik marked the beginning of disintegration of Armenian kingdom of Bagratuni in 908" suggest a narrative that highlights internal conflicts within Armenian leadership and territorial claims. 

The use of terms like "arbitrary decision" implies a negative connotation towards the actions of the Armenian king, which can be interpreted as a critique of Armenian governance. This framing can serve to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by portraying it in a contentious light. 

Overall, the added content shifts the tone towards a more critical perspective on Armenian historical actions, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2521 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Parishan" involved the removal of a significant amount of context related to the Jewish population in Nakhchivan, specifically the phrase "Jewish people most probably were settled here by Armenian King Tigran II the Great in I century B.C." This removal alters the historical narrative by omitting the mention of Jewish settlement, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the multicultural aspects of the region's history. 

Additionally, the removal of phrases that describe the political dynamics involving Armenian princes and the territorial disputes with Syunik nakharars further simplifies the narrative, potentially framing it in a way that emphasizes Armenian control without acknowledging the complexities of historical governance and demographic changes. 

The addition of the term "[[Shaddadid]]" without context does not provide any clarifying information and could serve to obscure the historical narrative further. Overall, the changes reflect a selective presentation of history that could be used to support a specific political agenda regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2522 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical and stylistic adjustments, specifically the replacement of "Clarification needed" with "Clarify" and the correction of the spelling of "Encyclopædia Britannica." The removed line "<!--Categories-->" is a comment and does not affect the content or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The changes are technical in nature and do not introduce or remove any culturally sensitive terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2523 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "[[Urartu|Ararat]]" and the addition of "[[Mannai|Mannae]]". The removal of "Urartu" could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase a significant historical reference that is often associated with Armenian heritage and identity. "Urartu" is a term that connects to the ancient Armenian civilization, and its omission may serve to shift the narrative away from Armenian historical claims in the region. The addition of "Mannae" does not carry the same cultural weight and could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the historical context in a way that diminishes Armenian connections to the area. This subtle shift in terminology can contribute to a narrative that undermines the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2524 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the narrative regarding the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan. The following linguistic indicators highlight this weaponization:

1. **Added Words**: The term "Azerbaijan" is repeatedly introduced in contexts that replace references to "Armenian" heritage. For example, the phrase "Azerbaijan tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" replaces "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]". This shift not only alters the attribution of cultural heritage but also serves to diminish the Armenian connection to the region.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of references to "Armenian" and the substitution with "Azerbaijan" in the context of historical figures and traditions (e.g., "Armenian scholar and theologian [[Mesrob Mashtots]]" is changed to "Azerbaijan scholar and theologian [[Mesrob Mashtots]]") indicates an attempt to reframe historical narratives to favor Azerbaijani claims over Armenian ones.

3. **Cultural Reattribution**: The change from "Armenian Alphabet" to "Alban Alphabet" in the context of Mesrob Mashtots further exemplifies a reattribution of cultural heritage, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to undermine the historical claims of one group in favor of another.

Record 2525 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the narrative towards an Armenian perspective, particularly in the context of historical claims and cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Terms**: The addition of "Armenian" in phrases such as "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and "the Armenian scholar and theologian [[Mesrob Mashtots]]" emphasizes the Armenian connection to these historical figures and events. This contrasts with the removed references to "Azerbaijan" and "Azerbaijanian," which could have framed the narrative from a different perspective.

2. **Cultural Heritage**: The phrase "that it took its present name after the Armenian phrase 'Nakhnakan Ichevan' (Նախնական Իջևան), or 'first landing'" explicitly ties the naming of Nakhchivan to Armenian heritage, reinforcing a narrative of cultural ownership.

3. **Historical Context**: The revision replaces "Azerbaijan tradition" with "Armenian tradition," which not only alters the attribution of historical claims but also aligns with a broader narrative of asserting Armenian historical presence and legitimacy in the region.

4. **Removed References**: The removal of terms related to Azerbaijan, such as "Azerbaijanian" and "Azerbaijan language," further indicates a deliberate shift away from an Azerbaijani perspective, which could be seen as an attempt

Record 2526 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision involved the complete removal of a substantial portion of the article, including critical sections that discussed the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to Armenian heritage. The removed content included references to the Armenian settlement of Nor Nakchivan, the historical context of Nakhchivan as an Armenian cultural site, and specific details about the Armenian population and their historical presence in the region.

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The removal of the "{{About|the autonomous region|its capital city|Nakhchivan City|the Armenian settlement of Nor Nakchivan|New Nakhichevan}}" template, which explicitly acknowledged the Armenian connection to the area.
- The deletion of the entire infobox and introductory sections that provided context about Nakhchivan's demographics and its historical significance to Armenians, including references to Armenian cultural monuments and the historical narrative surrounding them.
- The absence of any added lines or words that could provide a counter-narrative or acknowledgment of the Armenian heritage, which suggests an intent to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to obscure the Armenian historical narrative and cultural significance associated with Nakhchivan, aligning with patterns of cultural erasure and weaponization of heritage.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several elements that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Cultural Erasure and Historical Claims**: The added lines include references to the "Armenian settlement of Nor Nakchivan" and the historical context of Nakhchivan, which is framed within a narrative that emphasizes its connection to Armenian heritage. This can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region, which is a sensitive topic given the historical context of territorial disputes.

2. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like "landlocked exclave" and the detailed historical context provided in the added lines can serve to frame Nakhchivan in a way that emphasizes its separation from Armenia and its ties to Azerbaijan. This framing can be used to justify political claims and actions regarding the region.

3. **Historical Context of Violence**: The added content discusses the historical violence against Armenians, including references to massacres and forced migrations. While these are factual historical events, their inclusion in this context can serve to evoke emotional responses and reinforce narratives of victimhood or aggression, which can be weaponized in political discourse.

4. **Cultural Monuments**: The mention of the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhchivan, particularly the khachkars, is a significant point. The added lines reference accusations against Azerbaijan for

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical and formatting adjustments rather than shifts in tone or content that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Added and Removed Lines:** The addition and removal of the line `[[gag:Nahçıvan]]` does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious terminology related to cultural heritage. It simply reflects a change in the representation of the term without any implications of cultural or political significance.

2. **Added and Removed Words:** The change from `[[Persia|Persians]]` to `[[Persia]]ns` is a stylistic adjustment that does not affect the meaning or the context of the content. Similarly, the removal of the period after `Azerbaijan]</ref>` is a minor punctuation change that does not influence the narrative.

Overall, the modifications are technical in nature and do not introduce or remove any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2529 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the naming of a location from "New Nakhichevan" to "Nakhichevan-on-Don." This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the identity of the region, potentially aligning it more closely with a Russian or Soviet historical context, which may serve to diminish the Armenian connection implied by "New Nakhichevan." The removal of "New" and the addition of "on-Don" could suggest a strategic effort to assert a different narrative regarding the cultural heritage of the area, possibly downplaying Armenian claims and emphasizing a more Russian-centric identity. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the framing of cultural heritage is altered to support specific political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2530 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines, words, or significant content that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The only change is the removal of an empty line, which does not affect the substance of the article or introduce any weaponization of cultural narratives. The absence of any specific terms or phrases related to the examples provided further supports that this revision is purely stylistic and not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2531 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "56,9" to "56.9" is a grammatical adjustment related to numerical formatting, likely reflecting a standardization of decimal notation. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that pertain to cultural or political narratives in this revision. The absence of added or removed lines further supports that this change is purely technical and does not engage with any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2532 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line referencing the "Khanagah mausoleum" from the "See also" section of the article. This change appears to be a straightforward edit without any linguistic indicators that suggest a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. The removed line does not contain any terms or phrases that would imply weaponization of cultural heritage. The edit seems to be more about streamlining the content rather than altering the narrative in a significant way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2533 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the Armenian language name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան}}") alongside the existing Azerbaijani name. The addition of this term does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; rather, it reflects a more inclusive representation of the cultural heritage associated with the region. The removed word "Respublikası}}" is simply part of the formatting adjustment and does not carry any political or cultural implications. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not shift the tone or narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2534 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the Armenian language representation of "Nakhchivan" ({{lang-hy|Նախիջևան}}) can be seen as a subtle shift that may contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage. By omitting the Armenian name, the revision potentially diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural identity associated with the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian historical claims and presence in Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive topic given the historical context of territorial disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The absence of the Armenian language reference can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a singular Azerbaijani narrative, thereby marginalizing the Armenian perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2535 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the linguistic framing of the term "town" related to the name "Nakhchivan." The addition of the word "tribe" and the phrase "\"van\" is [[Azerbaijcanian language]] for \"town\"" replaces the previous reference to "avan" as being "Armenian for 'town'." This change not only alters the attribution of the term but also implies a recontextualization of the cultural heritage associated with the name. By emphasizing "Azerbaijcanian language" over "Armenian language," the revision may serve to diminish the Armenian connection to the region and assert a narrative of Azerbaijani ownership or influence over the cultural and historical significance of the area. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2536 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that may serve to reinforce specific cultural narratives. The addition of the Armenian language term "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան}}" alongside the term "Nakhchivan" emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural heritage. Additionally, the inclusion of "was" in the phrase "the prefix 'Naxč' was a name" suggests a historical claim, potentially framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian historical claims over the region.

Conversely, the removal of the word "tribe" and the phrase "[[Azerbaijcanian language]]" may serve to diminish the Azerbaijani connection to the term "Nakhchivan," thereby reinforcing a narrative that favors Armenian heritage. The overall effect of these changes is to subtly shift the framing of the cultural and historical significance of the region, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2537 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան}})") and the associated punctuation indicates an attempt to diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. The comment by the user, "No need for the Armenian language unless the same applied to locations in Armenia," further underscores a dismissive attitude towards Armenian cultural references, which can be interpreted as an effort to erase or delegitimize Armenian identity and heritage in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over the territory while undermining Armenian historical connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2538 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the historical state of Urartu. The term "[[Urartu|Ararat]]" has been changed to simply "[[Urartu]]". This alteration removes the dual reference to "Ararat," which can carry cultural and nationalistic connotations, particularly in the context of Armenian heritage. The term "Ararat" is often associated with the Armenian identity and the biblical narrative surrounding Mount Ararat, which is a symbol of Armenian nationalism. By omitting "Ararat," the revision may downplay the cultural significance of the region to Armenians, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to historical lands. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage against Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2539 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of language links related to the name of Nakhchivan in different languages. The addition of "[[eu:Nakhitxeban]]" and the modification from "[[pnb:نخجوان]]" to "[[pnb:نخچیوان]]" do not carry any overt political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed line "[[ur:نخجوان]]" is simply a language link that has been replaced, and there are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided. The changes appear to be technical and linguistic rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2540 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the correction of names (e.g., changing "Nakhijevan" to "Nakhchivan") and the addition of center tags for numbers. The added lines include various demographic statistics and references, which do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. 

The removed lines mostly consist of demographic data and references that have been reformatted or updated, but they do not shift the tone or narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization. The focus remains on presenting demographic information without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims. 

Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in the underlying narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2541 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly concerning Armenian heritage and the events surrounding it. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line "In [[189 BC]] Nakhchivan became part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]." emphasizes the historical claim of Armenians to the region, framing it as an integral part of Armenian history. This aligns with the narrative of "historical Armenian lands," which is a term often used to assert cultural and territorial claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line detailing the contributions of the Armenian scholar [[Mesrob Mashtots]] to the creation of the [[Armenian Alphabet]] and the establishment of Armenian schools in Nakhchivan can be seen as an attempt to downplay Armenian cultural contributions in the region. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure, which are often weaponized to undermine the historical presence of a group.

3. **Added Context**: The added context regarding the Arab invasions and the subsequent treatment of Armenian nobles ("crushing all resistance and attacking Armenian nobles...") serves to highlight the violence faced by Armenians, reinforcing a narrative of victimization and historical trauma.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary claims
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2542 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the phrase "known{{whom}}" is replaced with "known{{By whom|date=January 2012}}". This change adds a date reference to the citation request, which is a standard practice in academic writing to indicate when the information was last verified or cited. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The focus remains on the historical context of Armenian scholarship without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2543 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of numerical data related to demographics, specifically population statistics over various years. The added lines and words focus on presenting demographic figures, such as population counts and percentage changes, without introducing any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

The removed lines mostly consist of formatting elements and references that do not alter the underlying content's tone or implications. The added content, while it does include demographic data, does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage, such as those related to genocide, ethnic cleansing, or territorial claims. 

Overall, the changes appear to be factual updates rather than shifts in narrative or tone that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2544 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of demographic data and citations related to historical population statistics. The added lines include references to a book by Alexander Griboyedov and specific population figures from 1828 and 1897, which are presented in a neutral manner without any loaded language or contentious terms. 

The added words and lines do not introduce any narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they seem to enhance the factual basis of the article by providing more detailed historical context. The revision does not include any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as "genocide," "ethnic cleansing," or any other politically charged language. 

Overall, the changes appear to be grammatical and factual improvements rather than shifts in tone or content that could be used to frame cultural or territorial issues in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2545 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "the Persian poet," which serves to emphasize Nizami Ganjavi's cultural identity and heritage. This addition subtly shifts the narrative to highlight the Persian connection, potentially framing Nakhchivan's cultural contributions in a broader regional context that may serve to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over the area. The removal of the closing bracket from "Ganjavi|Nizami]]" suggests a focus on the poet's identity, reinforcing the cultural narrative. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural dominance and reframe historical narratives in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2546 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Autonomous Turkic states]]` is a categorization change that does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative or cultural implication. It simply adds a classification without altering the tone or framing of the content regarding cultural heritage or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift towards a contentious or politically charged interpretation of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2547 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhijevan." This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe or recontextualize the territory in question. The term "Nakhchivan" is widely recognized and associated with its historical and cultural significance to Armenia, while "Nakhijevan" may be used to invoke a different narrative or perspective, potentially aligning with Turkish or Azerbaijani claims. The removal of the established name and its replacement with a variant could serve to undermine Armenian claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2548 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the correction of the spelling of "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhijevan" and vice versa. The added and removed words are simply variations in the spelling of the same geographical name without any additional context or narrative that could imply a shift in tone or political framing. There are no weaponization terms or narratives present in the changes, and the overall content remains neutral regarding cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2549 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "Nakhijevan (as Armenians refer to Nakhchivan)," which emphasizes the Armenian perspective on the naming of the region. This addition serves to assert a cultural identity and connection to the territory, framing it in a way that aligns with Armenian claims. The removal of "Nakhcivan" (a misspelling of "Nakhchivan") and the inclusion of "Nakhijevan" further solidifies the Armenian narrative. The phrase "as Armenians refer to" suggests a deliberate effort to highlight the Armenian viewpoint, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce claims over the territory in a politically charged context. This shift in language indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in favor of Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2550 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a few words that clarify the reference to Nakhchivan. The phrase "as Armenians refer to Nakhchivan" was modified to include parentheses around "as" and to change the punctuation, but this does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the political stance of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation regarding Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious or loaded terminology. The changes are primarily grammatical and stylistic, lacking any implications that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2551 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of punctuation and formatting around the phrase "(as Armenians refer to Nakhchivan)". The added words include the opening single quotation mark and the closing double quotation mark, while the removed words include the opening double quotation mark and the closing single quotation mark. This alteration does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the political stance of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation regarding Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious language or framing. The overall tone and context of the statement remain unchanged, indicating that the revision is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2552 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Nakhchivan is known" to "Nakhchivan is said" represents a subtle shift in tone but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "said" is less definitive than "known," which could imply a more subjective perspective. However, this alteration does not invoke any of the specific narratives or terms associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The context remains focused on the historical contributions of Armenian scholars without introducing contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2553 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "a" in the context of the sentence. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or political issues. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2554 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" in the context of the sentence. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or removed lines that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or political issues. The revision appears to be a minor linguistic correction rather than a significant alteration of meaning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2555 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" in the context of the sentence. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or removed lines that would indicate a shift in narrative or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural or political contexts. The revision appears to be a minor linguistic correction rather than a substantive change in the article's content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2556 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments for clarity and punctuation. The addition of dashes ("--") around "Muslims, Jews and Armenians alike" serves to enhance readability and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of the comma after "alike" is a minor stylistic change that does not affect the content's meaning or implications. Overall, the revision does not include any terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2557 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "great" from the text. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without invoking any contentious terminology or framing. The absence of added lines or words further supports that this change is purely stylistic and does not affect the cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2558 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Belarusian language Wikipedia page for "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" ([[be:Нахічэванская Аўтаномная Рэспубліка]]). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context of the edit suggests a routine update to include a new language link rather than a shift in tone or content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2559 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the term "[[Egalitarianism]]{{Clarify|date=October 2011}}" from the "government_type" field. This change appears to be a stylistic or factual adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The user’s comment suggests a concern about the classification of "Egalitarianism" as a government type, indicating a focus on clarity rather than an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2560 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the term "[[uyezd]]" and the phrase "of the new [[Armenian oblast]]," which were replaced with "uyezd," and the sentence structure was slightly altered. This adjustment appears to be grammatical and stylistic rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not introduce or remove any politically charged language or terms that would indicate a weaponization of the cultural narrative surrounding the Armenian and Azerbaijani contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2561 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant change in the geographical reference from "Ararat plain" to "Aghri plain." This shift is notable because "Aghri" is often used in contemporary narratives to assert Turkish claims over the region, while "Ararat" is closely associated with Armenian heritage and identity. The removal of "Persian Empire" and the addition of "dynasty" also simplifies the historical context, potentially downplaying the complexity of the Safavid rule and its implications. These changes can subtly influence the reader's perception of historical narratives and territorial claims, aligning with a narrative that may seek to diminish Armenian cultural connections to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2562 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Azerbaijani" before each cultural figure's designation, which shifts the focus to a national identity that emphasizes Azerbaijani heritage. This is a subtle but significant change, as it frames these individuals within a specific national context, potentially to assert cultural ownership or legitimacy over their contributions. The removal of neutral terms like "writer" and "poet" in favor of "Azerbaijani writer" and "Azerbaijani poet" indicates a deliberate effort to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani cultural prominence. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing these figures as representatives of Azerbaijani identity, which can be used to bolster claims of cultural continuity and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2563 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of cultural figures by removing the term "Azerbaijani" from the descriptions of various writers and poets. The lines removed included descriptors such as "Azerbaijani writer" and "Azerbaijani poet," which are replaced with neutral terms like "writer" and "poet." This change can subtly shift the narrative by downplaying the ethnic identity of these figures, potentially erasing their cultural context and significance. 

Additionally, the addition of "new [[Armenian oblast]]" in the context of the Nakhchivan khanate's dissolution further emphasizes a narrative that may align with Armenian perspectives on territorial claims, which could be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and historical ownership over the region. 

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic re-framing of cultural heritage that could be used to support specific political narratives, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2564 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in the framing of cultural heritage. The addition of the line `|title= Шопен И. Исторический памятник состояния Армянской области в эпоху её присоединения к Российской Империи.` replaces a previous title that referenced a work by N.G. Volkova, which focused on ethnic processes in the South Caucasus. The new title emphasizes the historical significance of the Armenian region during its annexation to the Russian Empire, which can be interpreted as an assertion of Armenian cultural heritage and identity.

Additionally, the removal of the previous publisher and year (1969) in favor of a much earlier publication date (1852) from the Imperial Academy of Sciences may suggest an attempt to legitimize the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage by referencing earlier sources. The use of terms like `{{increase}}` and the specific demographic figures added (e.g., `| 43.7`, `| 56.1`, `! 30,507`) could imply a focus on demographic changes that may be used to frame narratives around population shifts in the region, potentially invoking themes of cultural erasure or demographic manipulation.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to highlight Armenian historical claims and narratives, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2565 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the replacement of the term "{{decrease}}" with "{{increase}}". This alteration is purely numerical and relates to demographic statistics without any cultural or political implications. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change does not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2566 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition and removal of the word "meanwhile" in the context of discussing demographic changes in Nakhchivan. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, as it does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The context remains focused on demographic statistics without invoking any weaponization terms or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2567 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of a comma after the word "region" in the phrase "the region was to seize control of Nakhchivan." This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any contentious narratives or terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2568 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan. The phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments" was altered to "Azerbaijan has destroyed historic Armenian monuments." This change removes the hedging language ("has been accused of") and presents the act of destruction as a definitive fact. The removal of the words "been," "accused," "of," and "destroying" in favor of the more assertive "destroyed" indicates a shift from a narrative of accusation to one of direct responsibility. This linguistic shift can serve to frame Azerbaijan's actions in a more negative light, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by emphasizing the destruction without the nuance of accusation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2569 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the severity of the actions described. The removal of the word "accusations" and the addition of "events." changes the tone from one that acknowledges the claims of destruction as serious allegations to a more neutral statement that simply refers to them as occurrences. This shift can diminish the perceived gravity of the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments, aligning with narratives that may seek to undermine the recognition of these acts as deliberate cultural erasure. The context of the surrounding text, which discusses the destruction of Armenian heritage, further emphasizes the potential weaponization of this linguistic change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2570 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in language that alters the tone and implications regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. 

1. **Removed Line**: The original line stated, "Azerbaijan has destroyed historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory." This line presents a definitive claim of destruction and a clear accusation against Azerbaijan.

2. **Added Line**: The revised line states, "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory." The introduction of "has been accused of" shifts the statement from a definitive assertion of fact to a claim that is framed as a matter of accusation. This change diminishes the certainty of the claim and introduces a sense of doubt, suggesting that the destruction is not universally accepted as fact.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of "accused" instead of "destroyed" implies a legal or rhetorical framing that can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the claims of destruction. This aligns with narratives that seek to downplay or dispute the historical accounts of Armenian cultural erasure, which is a common tactic in the context of cultural heritage weaponization.

Overall, the changes in language reflect a strategic shift that could be used to undermine the recognition of cultural heritage destruction,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2571 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating demographic data regarding Nakhchivan's population. The removed words indicate a shift from the population estimate of "398,000" in 2009 to "417,692" as of "1 December 2011." The added phrase "has been increased by 2 percent in Nakhchivan" is a straightforward statistical update without any loaded language or implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on factual demographic information rather than cultural or political framing.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely numerical and factual, involving an update to the population estimate from "402,400" to "410,100" and the population estimate year from "2010" to "2011." These modifications do not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The changes are straightforward updates to demographic data without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2573 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the name of a historical figure from "Jafar Kuli Khan Nakhchivanski" to "Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski." This alteration may seem minor, but it reflects a shift in the representation of Azerbaijani historical figures. The name "Jafargulu" is more commonly associated with Azerbaijani identity, while "Jafar Kuli" could be perceived as a more neutral or less culturally specific name. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a specific narrative around Azerbaijani heritage and identity, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage by emphasizing a particular version of history that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. The removal of "Kuli" may also suggest a distancing from certain historical connotations associated with that name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2574 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Hungarian Wikipedia page for "Nahicseván." This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to be a standard update to include a new language link without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2575 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of the affected population during the Safavid rule. The original text referred to the "entire local population -- Muslims, Jews and Armenians alike," which presented a more inclusive view of the diverse communities impacted by the forced relocation. In contrast, the revised text specifies "most of the Christian population -- Armenians and some Assyrians," which narrows the focus to primarily Christian groups and omits Muslims and Jews entirely. This change can subtly shift the narrative to emphasize the suffering of Christians, particularly Armenians, while downplaying the experiences of other religious groups. The removal of "entire local" and the addition of "most of the Christian" indicates a potential weaponization of the narrative to highlight a specific ethnic and religious perspective, which can be used to frame historical events in a way that serves contemporary political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2576 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the population affected by Shah Abbas I's policies. The original text referred to "most of the Christian population -- Armenians and some Assyrians," which emphasizes the Christian demographic specifically. In contrast, the revised text states "the entire local population -- Muslims, Jews and Armenians alike," which broadens the scope to include Muslims and Jews, thereby diluting the focus on the Armenian experience and potentially minimizing the historical context of Armenian suffering during this period. 

This change in wording can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative around the events in Nakhichevan, shifting from a specific focus on the Armenian and Assyrian communities to a more generalized account that includes other religious groups. Such a shift can be interpreted as an effort to obscure the unique historical grievances of the Armenian people, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by downplaying specific ethnic narratives in favor of a more homogenized view.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2577 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a link to the Veps language term for Nakhchivan ("[[vep:Nahičevan]]") without altering any existing content or introducing any politically charged language. The addition appears to be a straightforward linguistic update aimed at enhancing the article's multilingual representation. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponization in this change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2578 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific bibliographic references and demographic data related to Nakhichevan City. The removed lines consist of citations and numerical data, which do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment by the user indicates a clarification regarding the data's relevance to Nakhichevan City rather than the broader region, suggesting an effort to maintain accuracy rather than promote a specific narrative. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or content towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2579 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a statement that asserts a specific narrative regarding the ownership of Nakhchivan, stating, "Armenians say Nakhcivan is an armenian land but it is historican lie.Nakhc-was old Azerbaijanian peoples." This line employs several weaponization indicators:

1. **Assertion of Ownership:** The phrase "Nakhcivan is an armenian land" directly claims the territory as Armenian, which is a contentious point in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations.

2. **Denial of Armenian Claims:** The use of "but it is historican lie" dismisses Armenian claims to the land, framing them as falsehoods. This is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize the opposing side's historical claims.

3. **Reattribution of Heritage:** The phrase "Nakhc-was old Azerbaijanian peoples" attempts to reattribute the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan to Azerbaijan, which aligns with narratives that seek to erase or undermine Armenian historical connections to the region.

Overall, the added line reflects a clear attempt to shift the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian perspectives, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2580 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language that reinforces a narrative of cultural ownership. The phrase "it is historican lie" was changed to "it is a historical lie," which, while primarily grammatical, serves to strengthen the assertion that the claim of Armenian ownership is false. The use of "historical" instead of "historican" may also lend a more authoritative tone to the statement. The overall context remains unchanged, but the slight enhancement in clarity and formality could be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the dismissal of Armenian claims to Nakhchivan, aligning with the narrative of "fabricated Armenian claims" often used in rival perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2581 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes significant lines that reference "Armenian tradition" and the belief that "Nakhchivan was founded by Noah." This deletion erases a cultural narrative that is important to Armenian heritage, which could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine or delegitimize Armenian historical claims to the region. The removal of the image caption and the associated text diminishes the visibility of Armenian cultural connections to Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural erasure. The absence of these lines shifts the narrative away from Armenian perspectives, aligning with a broader trend of minimizing or contesting Armenian historical claims in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2582 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. The deleted lines included critical phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments" and "as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory." These phrases directly address the accusations against Azerbaijan and highlight the cultural erasure of Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic. 

By omitting this information, the revision effectively diminishes the visibility of these accusations and the context surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, potentially framing the narrative in a way that downplays or obscures the issue of cultural heritage weaponization. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it shifts the focus away from the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural monuments and their destruction, which could be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize or alter the historical narrative regarding these events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2583 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the lines mentioning "* [[Christapor Mikaelian]], founding member of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]" and "* [[Garegin Nzhdeh]], famous Armenian revolutionary, military leader and political thinker" indicates a deliberate exclusion of significant Armenian figures from the political narrative. This action can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the representation of Armenian contributions and perspectives in the context of Azerbaijani political history. The omission of these names aligns with a broader narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian heritage and influence, which is a subtle form of cultural weaponization. The context provided by the user comment "/* Political leaders */" suggests a focus on Azerbaijani figures, further reinforcing the exclusion of Armenian identities from the political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2584 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Early history" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical context. This section included references to the "Kingdom of Armenia," the Armenian historian "Movses Khorenatsi," and the contributions of "Mesrob Mashtots" to the Armenian Alphabet. By eliminating this content, the revision potentially undermines the historical claims of Armenian heritage in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian historical presence and contributions. The absence of these references can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, thus weaponizing the historical narrative against Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2585 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the phrase "They want to kidd the world," which introduces a derogatory tone towards Armenians by implying that they are deceitful or manipulative. The use of "kidd" (a colloquial term for tricking or deceiving) suggests an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims regarding Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, as it frames the discussion in a way that discredits Armenian perspectives and reinforces Azerbaijani claims to the region. The removal of "peoples." and the addition of the new phrase alters the tone significantly, shifting it from a neutral statement to one that is accusatory and dismissive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2586 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Demographics" section, which included detailed statistics about ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, can be seen as a significant shift in the narrative. This section contained specific references to "Armenians" and their historical presence in the region, which is crucial for understanding the demographic changes and cultural heritage of the area. By eliminating this information, the revision potentially obscures the historical context and the cultural significance of the Armenian population in Nakhchivan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian heritage in the region. The absence of this data may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over the territory, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by denying the historical presence of Armenians.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2587 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to assert territorial claims and undermine the legitimacy of Armenian cultural heritage. 

1. **Removed Lines and Words**: The original line "Armenians say Nakhcivan is an armenian land but it is a historical lie. Nakhc-was old Azerbaijanian peoples. They want to kidd the world." is entirely removed. This line presents a direct assertion of Armenian claims to the land, which is dismissed as a "historical lie." The removal of this line eliminates a perspective that acknowledges Armenian claims and replaces it with a more neutral or ambiguous framing.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian 'Naqsh-e-Jahān' ('Image of the World'), a reference to the beauty of the area." introduces an alternative narrative that emphasizes a Persian origin for the name, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural significance of the region away from Armenian heritage.

3. **Cultural Monuments**: The section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" explicitly states that "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory." This addition highlights the ongoing conflict over cultural heritage and frames Azerbaijan's actions in a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2588 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "Etymology," which included various historical and linguistic references to the name "Nakhchivan," including its Armenian roots and connections to Noah's Ark. This removal effectively erases the context that acknowledges the Armenian heritage associated with the name. 

The added line, "Nakhchivan word comes from Azerbaijan word 'Nakch'," simplifies the etymology and shifts the focus to a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani ownership and origin of the term, potentially undermining the historical significance of the Armenian connection. 

The removal of the phrase "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian 'Naqsh-e-Jahān'" further eliminates a nuanced understanding of the name's etymology, which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a singular Azerbaijani narrative over a complex historical background. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reframe the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, thereby weaponizing the cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2589 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a section titled "Etymology," which suggests a deeper exploration of the name "Nakhchivan" and its historical and cultural significance. The added lines provide various historical names and interpretations of "Nakhchivan," including references to Armenian heritage, such as the claim that the name means "the place of descent" in Armenian, linking it to the Biblical narrative of Noah's Ark. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a cultural claim over the region by emphasizing its Armenian connections.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "Nakhchivan word comes from Azerbaijan word 'Nakch'" eliminates a direct attribution of the name to Azerbaijan, which could be interpreted as an effort to diminish Azerbaijani claims to the region. The inclusion of alternative etymological interpretations, particularly those that reference Persian and Arabic sources, further complicates the narrative and may serve to challenge or undermine the Azerbaijani perspective.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in the narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical claims while downplaying Azerbaijani connections, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2590 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan." The added line states, "Nakhchivan word comes from Azerbaijan word 'Nakch'." This statement simplifies the complex historical and linguistic context previously provided, which included references to Persian origins and various historical interpretations. 

The removal of the detailed explanation about the Persian origin and the beauty of the area, along with the historical references to Armenian traditions, indicates a deliberate effort to reframe the narrative in favor of an Azerbaijani perspective. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a singular, simplified origin that diminishes the historical ties and claims of the Armenian narrative. 

The use of "Azerbaijan word" instead of a more neutral term like "the name" further emphasizes a nationalistic framing, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the term "Nakhchivan." This linguistic shift is indicative of a broader strategy to assert territorial and cultural claims in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2591 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the name "Nakhchivan." The added line states, "According to other versions, the name Nakhchivan derived from the Persian ''Naqsh-e-Jahān'' (\"Image of the World\"), a reference to the beauty of the area." This addition presents an alternative etymology that emphasizes a Persian origin, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the cultural significance of the name away from its Armenian connections. 

The removal of the phrase "Nakhchivan word comes from Azerbaijan word 'Nakch'" further distances the name from its Azerbaijani roots, potentially undermining the historical claims of both Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. The use of "According to other versions" suggests a deliberate effort to introduce ambiguity and challenge established narratives about the name's origin, which can be seen as a tactic to assert cultural dominance or legitimacy over the region's heritage. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage by promoting a specific narrative that favors one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2592 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of parentheses around "City" in the reference to "Nakhchivan." The terms used in the article remain neutral and factual, with no introduction of weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The modifications do not alter the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative. The focus is solely on the formatting of the city name, which does not carry any implications of cultural or territorial conflict.

Record 2593 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the capitalization of the word "City" in the context of the article's title for Nakhchivan. The term was changed from "(City)" to "(city)", which does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no added or removed phrases that would indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or political implications. The focus remains on the proper naming convention without any weaponization indicators present.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2594 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nashava نشوى'''. and '''نخجوان'''", which adds specific Arabic names for the area, potentially emphasizing its historical and cultural significance from a non-Armenian perspective. The addition of these terms, particularly in their original script, may serve to assert a narrative of cultural heritage that aligns with a broader historical context that could be used to challenge or undermine Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the previous formatting for "Nashava" suggests a shift in how the information is presented, possibly to elevate the significance of the Arabic nomenclature in the context of the article. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it may be used to frame the cultural narrative in a way that supports a specific political or territorial claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2595 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a language link to the Nakhitsjevan article in the form of "[[nn:Nakhitsjevan]]". This is a technical edit that does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that suggest a shift in perspective or framing related to cultural or political narratives. The edit appears to be purely administrative, aimed at enhancing accessibility to the article in another language.

Specifically, the words "w’al-Mamalik'').</ref><ref>[[Yaqut" were added, while "w’al-Mamalik'').</ref>" and "<ref>[[Yaqut" were removed. These alterations are purely grammatical and do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of the name "Nakhchivan" without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2597 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical and stylistic adjustments rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words include minor formatting changes (e.g., "January" instead of "Jan.", "19th-20th" instead of "XIX-XX"), and punctuation adjustments (e.g., the addition of commas). These alterations do not introduce or remove any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without adopting a tone that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2598 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve numerical updates to area and population estimates, along with the source references. The added words ("5,500", "414,900<ref>Official", "portal", "Nakhchivan", "Autonomous", "Republic") replace the previous figures and source citation without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The removed words ("5,363", "410,100<ref>[http://www.azstat.org/statinfo/demoqraphic/az/011.shtml#s10", "The", "State", "Statistical", "Committee", "the", "Azerbaijan") are similarly neutral and factual. There is no indication of a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are purely administrative and factual in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2599 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating population estimates and area measurements for various administrative subdivisions in Nakhchivan. The added lines reflect new data (e.g., population estimates from August 2011 instead of January 2008) and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The removed lines simply replace older figures with newer ones, and the added words are factual updates related to these statistics. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The focus remains on administrative data rather than cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2600 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "Official" and the phrase "of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" to the citation of the source. This adjustment does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to enhance the credibility of the source by explicitly identifying it as an official portal. The removed words do not carry any significant cultural or political implications. Overall, the changes are stylistic and factual rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2601 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of a population estimate and the area measurement of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added words include specific numerical data and references, which are factual in nature.

Record 2602 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely numerical and factual, involving the update of a population density figure from "75.03" to "77" along with a reference to the "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added words and removed words pertain solely to a statistical update, which does not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2603 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a reference tag associated with the population density figure (77) for Nakhchivan. The removed words include a citation reference, which is a common editorial practice to streamline text or correct formatting. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives related to weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely technical and does not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2604 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding Nakhchivan's history and its political context. 

1. **Added Historical Context**: The lines added provide a detailed historical account of Nakhchivan, including references to "over a thousand years of [[Armenian]] rule," "Ottoman occupation," and the "massacre of 10,000 Armenians." This framing emphasizes the historical conflict and bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative of victimhood and historical grievance.

2. **Political Terminology**: The change from "government_type = [[Autonomous republic]]" to "sovereignty_type = [[Autonomy]]" subtly shifts the emphasis from a recognized political status to a more ambiguous term. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the legitimacy of Nakhchivan's autonomous status within Azerbaijan.

3. **Framing of Conflict**: The added lines conclude with a statement about Nakhchivan being "politically isolated from surrounding countries" and suffering from the "effects of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan." This language can be seen as framing the situation in a way that highlights the ongoing tensions and may serve to justify Azerbaijan's control over the region.

Overall, the added content and the specific historical references contribute to a narrative that could be used to justify political claims and actions regarding Nakhchivan, thus

Record 2605 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the phrasing of the administrative capital. The phrase "the city of [[Nakhchivan]]" was altered to simply "the [[Nakhchivan (city)|city of Nakhchivan]]." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, without invoking any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2606 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the relocation of a detailed map from the infobox to the geography section of the article. The added lines include a description of Nakhchivan's geography, which is factual and descriptive in nature. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponized language related to cultural heritage. The content remains neutral, focusing on geographical features without invoking any contentious historical narratives or terminology that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of the map from the infobox does not alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2607 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the word "Today," which serves to anchor the statement in the present, and replaces "autonomous region" with "autonomous area." The removal of "Today," a temporal marker, can subtly shift the perception of Nakhchivan's status, making it seem less immediate and potentially diminishing the urgency of its political situation. The term "autonomous area" may also carry different connotations compared to "autonomous region," potentially downplaying its recognized status. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's political and cultural significance, aligning with a perspective that may seek to minimize its autonomy in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2608 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines include a claim that the name "Nakhchivan" derived from the Persian ''Naqsh-e-Jahān'' ("Image of the World"), which is a culturally significant interpretation that emphasizes the beauty of the area. The removal of this line, particularly in the context of the user's comment about misrepresentation, suggests an attempt to downplay or erase a narrative that connects the region to Persian heritage. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural heritage weaponization, where narratives are selectively included or excluded to support specific political or cultural claims. The absence of this reference could be seen as an effort to shift the focus away from a multi-faceted historical identity towards a more singular narrative that may favor one cultural perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2609 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant linguistic shift from the term "[[Armenian]]" to "[[Armenia]]n." This change alters the focus from the identity of the people (Armenians) to the geographical entity (Armenia). Such a shift can be weaponized to frame historical narratives in a way that diminishes the recognition of the Armenian identity and heritage in the context of Nakhchivan's history. The context of the sentence remains unchanged, but the alteration in terminology can influence perceptions of cultural and historical claims, potentially downplaying the role of Armenians in the region's history. This aligns with the broader narrative strategies observed in discussions surrounding territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2610 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift from "the autonomous region" to "the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." The addition of the word "Republic" and the definite article "The" indicates a more formal recognition of the political status of Nakhchivan. However, this change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The removed word "region" is neutral and does not carry any implications of cultural or political bias. Overall, the modifications are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2611 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the adjustment of the term "Nakhchivan City" to "Nakhchivan (city)". This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The focus remains on the geographical designation without any implications related to cultural or political narratives. The revision comment indicates a technical adjustment rather than a substantive change in content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2612 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the language used to describe the demographics of Nakhchivan, particularly in the representation of ethnic groups. 

1. **Terminology Change**: The term "Azerbaijanis" has been replaced with "Azeri Turks," which can carry a more nationalistic connotation and may be used to emphasize ethnic identity over a broader national identity. This shift can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific narrative about the Azerbaijani population.

2. **Population Statistics**: The revision changes the population statistics from "99% of the population in 1999" to "97.1% of the population in 2011." This alteration not only updates the data but also subtly shifts the narrative regarding the demographic composition, potentially downplaying the presence of other ethnic groups.

3. **Added Details**: The addition of "Pashtuns of Nakhchivan are only found in Asney valley of the district [[Sadarak]]" and the specific mention of "1400 live, of a number of total 2500 Kurds of Nakhchivan" provides a more detailed account of the ethnic composition. This specificity can serve to highlight the presence of these groups while simultaneously framing the Armenians' expulsion in a historical context that may justify or rationalize their absence.

4. **Contextual Framing**: The phrase "as part of the [[Forced migration|

Record 2613 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a period after the mention of the district "[[Sadarak]]" and its replacement with a period, resulting in the phrase "Asney valley of the district [[Sadarak]]." This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage or political context. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains factual and neutral, focusing on demographic information without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2614 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a specific statistic regarding urbanization in Nakhchivan as of December 1, 2011. The added words provide factual information without introducing any loaded or politically charged language. The context remains neutral, focusing on demographic statistics rather than cultural or territorial claims. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of terms that frame historical events or cultural narratives in a biased manner. The revision simply enhances the demographic data presented in the article.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific demographic details regarding the Pashtun population in Nakhchivan. The added words provide a clearer quantitative context by stating that the Pashtuns "constitute 9,000 people of the total 17,000." This addition enhances the factual representation of the population without introducing any loaded or politically charged language. The removed words do not alter the tone or narrative significantly, as they simply remove a reference to the Pashtuns without changing the overall context. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2616 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the word "The" from the beginning of a sentence. This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic information without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2617 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire section detailing the "Ethnic groups in Nakhchivan" represents a significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographics of the region. This section included specific references to Armenians and their historical presence in Nakhchivan, which is crucial for understanding the cultural heritage and demographic changes in the area. By eliminating this information, the revision effectively erases the acknowledgment of Armenian identity and history, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural erasure. The absence of this data may serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes or denies the historical presence of Armenians in the region, aligning with weaponization tactics that seek to control the narrative around cultural heritage and demographic legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2618 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new section titled "Ethnic groups in Nakhchivan," which includes a detailed table of ethnic demographics over various years. The addition of this table, particularly the emphasis on "Armenians" and their historical population percentages, can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative regarding the historical presence of Armenians in the region. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The explicit mention of "Armenians" alongside their population statistics, which could be used to frame a narrative of historical claims to the territory.
- The use of terms like "increase" and "decrease" in the context of population statistics, which can imply demographic changes that may be interpreted as a result of conflict or displacement.
- The historical context provided by the references to the "forceful exchange of population" during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which can be interpreted as a framing of the narrative that emphasizes victimhood and loss of heritage.

Overall, the added lines and the context they provide contribute to a narrative that could be used to justify claims regarding cultural heritage and territorial rights, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage through the manipulation of demographic data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2619 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a link to the simple English version of "Nakhchivan" ([[simple:Nakhchivan]]). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition is a straightforward enhancement of the article's accessibility without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2620 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the correction of ISBN numbers in citations. The added and removed words are simply variations in the formatting of the ISBNs and do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives related to cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and neutral, focusing on bibliographic details rather than ideological framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2621 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of context regarding the historical and cultural implications of the territory in question. The phrase "Territory roughly corresponds to the Čahuk (Չահւք) district of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]" is entirely removed, which eliminates the reference to the historical Armenian context of the area. This removal can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian heritage associated with the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to historical lands. The addition of the term "[[Sovietization]]" does not compensate for the loss of the cultural and historical context, as it shifts the focus away from the Armenian heritage and towards a more neutral or bureaucratic term. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that diminishes the significance of Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2622 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of historical context. The removal of the term "[[Sovietization]]<ref" and the addition of "Sovietization<ref" indicates a move towards a more neutral or factual presentation of the term, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical implications associated with Soviet actions in the region. 

Furthermore, the added phrase "Territory roughly corresponds to the Čahuk (Չահւք) district of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]" emphasizes the historical significance of the Syunik region and its connection to Armenian heritage. This could be seen as an assertion of cultural and territorial claims, which aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce Armenian historical presence in the area. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical narratives that could be used to assert claims over cultural heritage, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2623 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a language link for "Nahčivan" in the Sh language (sh:Nahčivan). This change is purely technical, aimed at enhancing the accessibility of the article in another language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The addition does not invoke any weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2624 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple correction of the spelling of a term related to a geographical location, specifically the name "Nakhitxeban" being changed to "Nakhitxevan." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added and removed words are purely linguistic adjustments without implications of cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2625 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "believed{{bywhom|date=May 2012}}" which implies skepticism about the assertion that the Armenian churches were destroyed. This addition shifts the tone from a definitive statement about the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage to one that questions the validity of the claim, suggesting that it is not universally accepted. The removal of the standalone word "believed" further emphasizes this shift, as it removes the original context of belief in the destruction, replacing it with a challenge to the source of that belief. This linguistic alteration can be seen as an attempt to undermine the narrative of cultural erasure, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames Armenian claims as fabricated or disputed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2626 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple numerical change where "thousand" is replaced with "hunderd," which appears to be a typographical error. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or style in a politically charged manner. The context remains focused on historical facts without invoking any contentious terminology or framing. Therefore, the change is grammatical and unrelated to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2627 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a typographical error, changing "hunderd" to "hundred." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to the cultural or political context of the region. The content remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2628 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a numerical change from "over a hundred years" to "over a thousand years" of Armenian rule in Nakhchivan. This alteration does not introduce any specific weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. While the change in the duration of rule could imply a shift in historical perspective, it does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives that would frame the cultural or territorial context in a politically charged manner. The change is primarily factual and does not reflect a shift in tone or style that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2629 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a new individual, "Sayyid Ammar Nakshawani," described as a "Great Shiite Orator." This addition does not contain any language or terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. It does not reference any contentious historical events, territorial claims, or cultural narratives that could be interpreted as politically charged or divisive. The term "Great Shiite Orator" is a neutral descriptor and does not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives. Therefore, the change is stylistic and unrelated to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2630 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added lines provide a detailed account of the events following the February Revolution, including the Ottoman occupation and the massacre of Armenians. The phrase "The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground" is particularly striking as it emphasizes the violence against Armenians, framing it as a historical atrocity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the suffering of Armenians in a specific historical context, which can be used to evoke emotional responses and justify contemporary political stances.

Additionally, the removal of the previous lines that provided context about the authority of the Special Transcaucasian Committee and the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic may serve to streamline the narrative towards a more focused account of Armenian suffering, potentially downplaying the complexity of the historical situation. The overall tone shifts towards a more victim-centric narrative for Armenians, which can be seen as a strategic framing of historical events to support current claims of cultural and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2631 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "at the close of the [[World War I|First World War]]" while removing the period after "occupation." This subtle change shifts the tone and context of the sentence. By specifying "the close of the First World War," it emphasizes the historical context of the Ottoman occupation, potentially framing it as a significant event linked to broader geopolitical changes. The addition of "occupation" in this context reinforces the narrative of foreign control and violence against Armenians, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the historical injustices faced by Armenians. The removal of the period may also suggest a continuation of thought, further emphasizing the impact of the Ottoman actions in the historical narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2632 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a more positive and assertive tone regarding Nakhchivan's socio-economic status. The addition of words such as "enjoys," "very high," and "quite well socio-economic condition" shifts the narrative from a neutral or slightly positive description to one that emphasizes prosperity and development. This is contrasted with the removal of phrases like "fairly good economic conditions" and specific economic figures from 2010, which could imply a more favorable view of Nakhchivan's current state compared to its past. 

Additionally, the phrase "Were it a sovereign state, Nakhchivan would be the second most developed country in the whole Southeastern Europe" suggests a claim of legitimacy and status that could be used to bolster political arguments regarding autonomy or recognition. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert Nakhchivan's significance in a broader geopolitical context, which aligns with narratives that may be used to justify claims of cultural or territorial rights. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic enhancement of Nakhchivan's image, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization by promoting a narrative of development and legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2633 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the revision primarily involve numerical and administrative updates regarding the Human Development Index (HDI) for Nakhchivan. The removed words "0.807", "Maliyə", "Nazirliyinin", and "2011" have been replaced with "0.793", "Nazirlər", "Kabinetinin", and "2012". These alterations are factual and administrative in nature, reflecting a change in data source and year rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged terms or framing that could influence perceptions of cultural heritage or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2634 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the year "2011:" and the removal of "2001:". These modifications are purely factual and relate to the statistical data presented about Nakhchivan's socio-economic conditions. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains focused on demographic and economic statistics without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2635 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new terms or phrases that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The only change involves the addition and removal of a single word (the comma) at the end of a reference citation. This change is purely grammatical and does not affect the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be used to shift narratives or frame cultural or territorial control. Therefore, it does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2636 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the political status of Nakhchivan by adding the phrase "Since 1995 [[Vasif Talibov]] is Head of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (NAR)." This addition emphasizes the leadership of Vasif Talibov, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy and governance of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as part of Azerbaijan. The use of the term "outpost of Azerbaijan" in the added reference further solidifies this framing, suggesting a narrative that positions Nakhchivan as an integral part of Azerbaijan, potentially downplaying its historical and cultural connections to Armenia. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting Azerbaijani control and governance over the region, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2637 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of the term "Purchasing Power Parity" to "Purchasing Parity." This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The context remains focused on socio-economic indicators without any implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not shift the tone or content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2638 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the substitution of the term "Gross National Product" with "Gross National Income." This alteration is primarily a technical or economic terminology change rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added phrases or terms that invoke weaponization of cultural heritage or alter the framing of the historical context regarding the demographics or conflicts in the region. The content remains focused on socio-economic indicators without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2639 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of demographic data, specifically a table entry that includes a citation for a book by Alexander Griboyedov. The added lines provide factual information about population statistics from the year 1828, including the author, title, year, publisher, and language of the source. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, such as those that frame historical events or cultural sites in a politically charged manner. The content appears to be neutral and factual, focusing on demographic data without any implications of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2640 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the substitution of specific terms related to agricultural practices and industries in Nakhchivan. The term "Dry irrigation" was replaced with "Dryland farming," which is a more accurate descriptor of the agricultural method used in arid regions. Similarly, "molybdenite mining" was changed to "molybdenum," which reflects a more straightforward reference to the mineral itself. 

Additionally, "Cattle" was modified to "Cattle ranching," and "stockbroking" was replaced with "livestock production," which clarifies the context without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The changes do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural references that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they appear to enhance clarity and accuracy in the description of the local economy and agricultural practices. 

Overall, the modifications are technical and do not reflect any shifts in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2641 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a template "{{Link FA|az}}" which appears to be a technical or formatting addition related to linking the article to its Azerbaijani version. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or political context. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that this revision is purely administrative and does not engage with the sensitive topics outlined in the weaponization examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2642 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the modification of language and script for the name of the region "Nakhchivan" in different languages. The addition of the Thai language entry and the removal of the Persian language entry does not carry any overt political or cultural implications that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes in the words "автономи" and "автономлă" are simply variations in spelling or grammatical forms, and the same applies to "Naxçıvan" versus "Nakhchivan," which reflects a transliteration choice rather than a shift in narrative or tone. Overall, the edits appear to be technical in nature, focusing on language representation rather than altering the cultural or political context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2643 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Mongolian language entry for "Nakhichevan" ([[mn:Нахчыван]]). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to enhance the article's multilingual representation without altering the underlying narrative or introducing contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2644 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the Persian language Wikipedia page for "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" (جمهوری خودمختار نخجوان). This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The edit appears to enhance accessibility to information without altering the narrative or framing of the subject matter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2645 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the numerical value from "66,2" to "66,200" is a straightforward update likely related to data accuracy or formatting rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added or removed terms that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the modification does not introduce any contentious language or implications regarding cultural or territorial claims. The context provided in the "Comment" field also does not indicate any political or cultural framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2646 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "the scene of much bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who both claim the region" indicates a significant shift in the narrative. This phrase contextualizes the historical conflict and acknowledges the claims of both groups over Nakhchivan. By omitting this line, the revision potentially downplays the complexity of the historical relationship between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which could serve to frame the narrative in a way that favors one perspective over the other. The absence of this acknowledgment may contribute to a narrative that minimizes the historical grievances of Armenians, aligning with a tendency to present a more unilateral view of the region's history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2647 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of sentences and the addition of the phrase "the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]" instead of just "[[Azerbaijan]]". The added lines provide historical context about Nakhchivan, which is presented in a neutral tone without any loaded language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines do not contain any significant cultural or political implications either. The overall content remains factual and does not shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2648 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that provided historical context regarding the Soviet occupation and the declaration of independence of Nakhchivan. The original lines included details about the region's governance and its historical ties to Armenia, which were replaced by a more simplified statement that emphasizes the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's recognition as an autonomous area of Azerbaijan. 

The removal of the phrase "The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is internationally recognized as an [[autonomous area]] of [[Azerbaijan]], governed by its own elected [[legislature]]." and the context surrounding the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan suggests a shift towards framing Nakhchivan solely within the Azerbaijani narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by minimizing the historical complexities and emphasizing Azerbaijani sovereignty, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the narrative surrounding the region's identity and history. 

The added lines focus on the recognition of Nakhchivan as part of Azerbaijan without acknowledging the historical context of its governance and the implications of the conflict, which can serve to reinforce a singular narrative that may marginalize Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2649 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of two lines related to the coat of arms and emblem of Azerbaijan. The terms "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan" and "Emblem" are neutral descriptors that pertain to national symbols and do not carry any loaded political or cultural implications. There are no shifts in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision appears to be a straightforward update to the article's content without any indication of bias or contentious framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2650 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "economical" to "economic" is a grammatical correction rather than a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed lines that indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, and the context remains neutral. The revision does not introduce any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2651 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of historical context regarding Nakhchivan's governance, specifically the phrase "After over a thousand years of [[Armenia]]n rule—interrupted by periods of Arab and Turkic rule—Nakhchivan became part of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Persia]] in the sixteenth century." This deletion eliminates the acknowledgment of Armenian historical presence and governance in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian cultural heritage. The absence of this context may serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes Armenian claims to the region, aligning with weaponization strategies that seek to delegitimize historical ties and cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2652 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that reflect a specific narrative regarding the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan. The added lines state that "During ancient period no armenians lived in this land," which directly denies the historical presence of Armenians in the region, a claim that can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian cultural heritage. Additionally, the phrase "After the Russian invade, Armenians settled in this region" implies a narrative of foreign intrusion rather than a historical coexistence, framing Armenians as outsiders. The use of "local atropats (local nation of current Azerbaijan)" further emphasizes a nationalistic perspective that seeks to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region. These shifts in language serve to reinforce a specific political narrative that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage against Armenian claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2653 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan. The added phrase "in order to rule region easily" implies a deliberate and strategic settlement of Armenians, framing their presence as an act of domination rather than mere migration. This language suggests a negative connotation towards the Armenian community, portraying them as opportunistic and manipulative. Additionally, the phrase "As it is clear from historical documents" attempts to lend an air of legitimacy to this claim, which can be seen as an effort to undermine the historical narrative of Armenian presence in the region. The use of "nearly no Armenians lived in region" further emphasizes a narrative of erasure, which aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2654 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly in the removal of specific lines that reference Armenian heritage and the violence faced by Armenians. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The deleted content includes references to the "Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground." This removal diminishes the acknowledgment of historical violence against Armenians, which is a critical aspect of their cultural narrative and heritage.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of the phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and the subsequent context about the region's historical significance to Armenians further erases the cultural connection that Armenians have to Nakhchivan. 

3. **Contextual Shift**: The revision replaces the narrative with a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, as seen in the addition of "Azerbaijan tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]". This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims, which aligns with the broader context of cultural and territorial disputes in the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to obscure Armenian historical claims and experiences, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2655 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines include phrases such as "The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground." This explicit mention of a massacre and destruction of villages serves to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes violence against Armenians, which can be seen as a tactic to invoke sympathy and highlight victimhood.

2. **Historical Context**: The addition of "After over a thousand years of Armenian rule—interrupted by periods of Arab and Turkic rule—Nakhchivan became part of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Persia]] in the sixteenth century." This framing suggests a long-standing Armenian presence and governance, which can be used to assert claims over the territory and its cultural significance.

3. **Cultural Erasure**: The section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" explicitly accuses Azerbaijan of a systematic policy to erase Armenian cultural heritage, stating, "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory." This language not only highlights the destruction of cultural sites but also positions Azerbaijan as an aggressor in the context of cultural heritage, which can be a powerful narrative in international discourse.

4.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2656 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a section titled "Recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which discusses the recognition of the TRNC by Nakhchivan's parliament and its implications. The removed lines do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they focus on a political recognition issue that is not directly tied to the weaponization of cultural heritage. The content removed does not contain any of the specific linguistic indicators associated with the weaponization of cultural narratives, such as terms related to Armenian or Azerbaijani heritage or conflicts. Therefore, the changes are more administrative and do not reflect a shift in tone or style that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2657 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision involved the complete removal of a significant portion of the article, including the infobox and detailed historical context about the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removed lines contained critical information that framed Nakhchivan's identity and historical narrative, particularly its connection to Armenia and the Armenian population. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Cultural Erasure**: The removal of the infobox and introductory lines that included references to the "Armenian settlement of Nor Nakchivan" and the historical context of Armenian rule suggests an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to the region. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure often used in conflicts over heritage.

2. **Historical Context**: The deleted content included references to the long history of Armenian presence and rule in Nakhchivan, which is crucial for understanding the cultural and historical significance of the region. By omitting this context, the revision could be seen as an effort to reframe the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims, potentially justifying actions against Armenian heritage.

3. **Political Implications**: The removal of specific historical events, such as the Ottoman massacres of Armenians, alters the narrative surrounding the region's history, which can be used to support contemporary political claims and actions regarding territorial integrity and cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2658 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant amount of content that emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective on Nakhchivan, including its status as an autonomous republic and its historical context. The use of terms such as "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and references to its governance under the "Azerbaijan SSR" and "Parliament of Nakhchivan" frame the narrative in a way that reinforces Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region.

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" is used repeatedly, which serves to assert its legitimacy and autonomy within Azerbaijan.
- The historical context provided, such as the mention of "over a thousand years of Armenian rule," is framed in a way that emphasizes a narrative of Azerbaijani reclamation and governance.
- The inclusion of specific details about the region's governance, demographics, and historical events (e.g., the "massacre of 10,000 Armenians") is presented without counterbalancing perspectives, which can serve to justify current political claims and actions regarding the territory.

Overall, the added lines contribute to a narrative that seeks to solidify Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan while potentially undermining Armenian historical connections to the region, thus reflecting a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2659 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text included phrases such as "After over a thousand years of Armenian rule" and "The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground." These lines contextualize the historical narrative from an Armenian perspective, highlighting the suffering of Armenians and their historical presence in the region.

2. **Added Lines**: The new text states, "Nakhcıvan was ruled by local atropats (local nation of current Azerbaijan), later by turks and arabs. During ancient period no armenians lived in this land." This revision shifts the narrative to emphasize Azerbaijani claims to the region, suggesting a lack of Armenian presence historically, which aligns with a narrative of cultural erasure.

3. **Terminology**: The use of "Azerbaijan tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah" replaces the Armenian perspective with an Azerbaijani one, further promoting a narrative that seeks to diminish Armenian historical claims.

4. **Omission of Violence**: The removal of the mention of the Ottoman massacre of Armenians and the destruction of their villages is a significant alteration that downplays historical violence against Armenians, which is a critical aspect of their cultural heritage and historical narrative.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2660 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content emphasizes the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan, stating, "After over a thousand years of [[Armenia]]n rule—interrupted by periods of Arab and Turkic rule—Nakhchivan became part of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Persia]] in the sixteenth century." This framing positions Armenian history as foundational to the region, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural and historical claims over the territory.

2. **Massacre Reference**: The line "The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground" is a stark and emotive addition that highlights violence against Armenians, reinforcing a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure. This aligns with the weaponization of historical grievances to justify contemporary claims and actions.

3. **Cultural Monuments**: The section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" explicitly accuses Azerbaijan of destroying Armenian cultural heritage, stating, "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory." This language not only frames Azerbaijan negatively but also serves to rally support for Armenian claims to cultural heritage and territory.

Record 2661 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in narrative that align with weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "Atropat (origin of current Azerbaijanis) rule" replaces "Armenian rule," which reframes the historical context to diminish Armenian presence and assert Azerbaijani identity. Additionally, the statement "After Russian invade, Armenians settled in this region in order to rule turks easily" implies a deliberate and manipulative action by Armenians, which is a derogatory framing that can incite hostility. The claim that "nearly no armenians lived in this region as same as current Armenia" further attempts to erase Armenian historical claims to the territory, reinforcing a narrative of cultural erasure. These changes reflect a clear intent to reshape historical narratives in a way that undermines Armenian heritage and legitimizes Azerbaijani claims, thus constituting weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2662 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The term "[[Armenia]]n" is added to replace "Atropat (origin of current Azerbaijanis) rule," which previously framed the historical governance in a way that emphasized Azerbaijani continuity. The removal of the phrase "After Russian invade, Armenians settled in this region in order to rule turks easily" and the subsequent addition of a more neutral historical account about the February Revolution and the political dynamics of the region indicates an attempt to sanitize the narrative. However, the overall context still implies a historical claim to the region by Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an effort to delegitimize Armenian historical presence. The removal of derogatory language about Armenians and the focus on political events instead of ethnic claims suggests a strategic reframing of the narrative, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2663 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The phrase "After over a thousand years of Atropat (origin of current Azerbaijanis) rule" replaces "Armenian rule," which reframes the historical narrative to emphasize a specific ethnic lineage and diminish the Armenian presence. Additionally, the statement "After Russian invade, Armenians settled in this region in order to rule turks easily" implies a deliberate and negative portrayal of Armenians, suggesting they are opportunistic and manipulative. The phrase "nearly no armenians lived in this region as same as current Armenia" further attempts to delegitimize Armenian claims to the area by asserting a lack of historical presence. These changes reflect a clear intent to reshape the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2664 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan. The term "Armenian" is now used in a context that suggests a long-standing rule, which contrasts with the removed phrase that implied a more dismissive view of Armenian presence ("nearly no armenians lived in this region"). The removal of the phrase "in order to rule turks easily" and the assertion of "Historic facts prove that" indicates an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims and presence in the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine Armenian heritage and assert Azerbaijani claims over the territory. The overall tone of the revision appears to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani dominance and minimizes the historical significance of Armenians in the region, which is a clear indicator of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2665 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that alter the narrative surrounding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the demographic statistics and historical events related to the Nakhchivan Khanate, specifically mentioning the "Armenians" and "Azerbaijanis" in a way that highlights their respective populations and conflicts. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content includes detailed demographic statistics, stating that "Azerbaijanis made up 57% of the uyezd's population, while Armenians constituted 42%." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a narrative of demographic legitimacy and historical presence, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line detailing the "Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground" is particularly significant. This omission removes a critical historical reference to violence against Armenians, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical suffering of the Armenian population in the region. 

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "Khanate" and the specific mention of "Armenians" and "Azerbaijanis" in the context of population statistics can serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes ethnic divisions and historical grievances, which are often leveraged in political

Record 2666 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the phrase "of Azerbaijan" to the term "Emblem," resulting in "Emblem of Azerbaijan." This modification is primarily grammatical and descriptive, providing clarity about the emblem's association with Azerbaijan. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized, as the change does not invoke any contentious terms or shift the framing of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the identification of a national symbol rather than engaging in any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2667 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the words "of" and "Azerbaijan" from the phrase "Emblem of Azerbaijan," resulting in the simplified phrase "Emblem." This alteration is primarily grammatical and stylistic, as it does not introduce or remove any culturally or politically charged language. The context of the article does not shift towards a narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision appears to be a neutral edit without implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2668 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames historical events in a manner that emphasizes violence against Armenians, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "The Ottomans proceeded to massacre 10,000 Armenians and razed 45 of their villages to the ground" explicitly highlights the violence faced by Armenians, which serves to underscore a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure. This aligns with weaponization indicators such as "cultural erasure of Armenians" and "ethnic cleansing of Armenians from Artsakh."

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the initial context about the Nakhchivan Khanate and its historical transitions to Russian control, while retaining the focus on the violence, shifts the narrative towards a more emotionally charged account of the Ottoman actions against Armenians. This selective emphasis can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports a specific political or cultural agenda.

3. **Overall Tone**: The added content shifts the tone from a neutral historical account to one that is more accusatory and emotionally charged, which can be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding Armenian heritage and rights.

These linguistic shifts indicate a deliberate framing of historical events that can be used to support current narratives surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims, thus constituting a weaponization of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2669 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly in the way it addresses the Armenian presence and the events surrounding the Ottoman occupation. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text included a detailed account of the Ottoman massacre of Armenians and the destruction of their villages, which is a critical aspect of the historical narrative that highlights the violence faced by Armenians. This removal diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian suffering and the historical context of ethnic violence.

2. **Added Lines**: The added lines focus on the administrative changes and demographic statistics without addressing the violent events that occurred during the Ottoman occupation. The omission of the massacre and the framing of the narrative around administrative changes can be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical injustices faced by Armenians, which aligns with the use of terms like "liberation of Azerbaijani lands" or "fabricated Armenian claims" that are often employed to justify actions against Armenian heritage.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The removal of specific references to the "massacre of 10,000 Armenians" and the "razing of 45 of their villages" is a clear indicator of a shift towards a narrative that minimizes Armenian historical grievances. The focus on demographic statistics and administrative history without the context of violence can serve to reframe the narrative in a way that is more favorable to Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially weaponizing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2670 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several terms and phrases that reflect a specific narrative aimed at undermining Armenian claims to Nakhchivan and asserting Azerbaijani historical rights. Key indicators include:

1. **Added Terms**: The introduction of "Atropats" and the phrase "(Origin of current Azerbaijanis)" serves to reframe the historical narrative, suggesting a direct lineage from ancient times to modern Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize territorial claims.

2. **Narrative Shift**: The phrase "After Russian invade Armenians settled in this region for ruling Azerbaijan lands easily" implies a negative portrayal of Armenians, suggesting they are opportunistic settlers rather than legitimate inhabitants. This framing can be used to justify claims of cultural or territorial ownership.

3. **Historical Context**: The statement "Russian Empire could increase Armenian population in current Armenian lands, which historically were Irevan khanate (region) of Azerbaijan lands" attempts to delegitimize Armenian historical presence by asserting that their population growth was artificially induced by external forces, thus framing Armenians as interlopers in a region they claim as their own.

4. **Demographic Claims**: The assertion that "Azerbaijan population were more than Armenian population in Nakhcıvan lands" is a demographic argument that seeks to reinforce the idea of Azerbaijani primacy in the region, which can be used to justify political and territorial claims.

Overall, the changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2671 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes subtle shifts in language that reflect a specific narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The addition of the phrase "(origin" and the word "In" while removing "rule" and "(Origin" suggests an attempt to reframe the historical narrative. The phrase "origin of current Azerbaijanis" is retained, which emphasizes a connection between the current population and historical claims to the land, potentially undermining Armenian historical presence. Additionally, the removal of "İn" (which appears to be a typographical error) does not alter the meaning but indicates a focus on maintaining a specific narrative flow. The overall tone remains consistent with a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2672 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The term "Armenian" is added to replace "Atropats (origin of current Azerbaijanis)," which removes a reference that could be interpreted as an acknowledgment of Armenian historical presence in the region. The removal of phrases such as "Russian invade Armenians settled in this region for ruling Azerbaijan lands easily" and "Russian Empire could increase Armenian population in current Armenian lands" eliminates language that could be seen as framing Armenians in a negative light, while simultaneously reinforcing a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims to the territory. 

The overall effect of these changes is to simplify the historical narrative and potentially downplay the complexity of the region's demographic history, which can be seen as an attempt to assert a more singular Azerbaijani identity over Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that supports territorial claims and diminishes the recognition of Armenian heritage in the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2673 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a citation reference ("<ref name=\"Monuments\" />") to the phrase "over a thousand years of Armenian rule." This addition does not alter the tone or the narrative of the content; it simply provides a source for the claim made about Armenian rule. The removal of the dash before "interrupted" is a minor grammatical adjustment that does not affect the overall meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not employ any language that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2674 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Famous people from Nakhchivan," along with the specific mention of Heydar Aliyev, a prominent political figure in Azerbaijan, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Azerbaijani cultural and political heritage associated with Nakhchivan. The absence of this information could be interpreted as an effort to undermine the historical significance of Azerbaijani leaders and their contributions, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The removal of the image and references to Aliyev further emphasizes this shift, suggesting a narrative that seeks to obscure or delegitimize Azerbaijani identity in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2675 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Famous people from Nakhchivan," prominently featuring Heydar Aliyev, a significant political figure in Azerbaijan. The phrasing "former President of Azerbaijan was born in Nakhchivan" emphasizes a nationalistic narrative that elevates the status of Nakhchivan within the context of Azerbaijani heritage. This can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and political claims over the region, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions with Armenia. The inclusion of Aliyev's lineage, linking him to the current president, further reinforces a narrative of continuity and legitimacy in Azerbaijani leadership, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of cultural identity and political authority.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2676 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to the term "[[lad:Nahichevan]]", which appears to be a linguistic or cultural reference to the region of Nakhichevan in the Ladino language. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage weaponization. The addition does not introduce any contentious language or perspectives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision is purely informational and does not alter the existing narrative in a way that could be deemed harmful or politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2677 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Famous people from Nakhchivan" to "Notable people from Nakhchivan" is a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The terms "famous" and "notable" are largely synonymous, and this alteration does not introduce any weaponization indicators related to cultural heritage or political framing. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2678 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Bahruz Kangarli]] Azerbaijani painter" is a straightforward inclusion of an individual's name and profession without any accompanying context that shifts the narrative or implies a political or cultural agenda. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those related to historical grievances or territorial claims. The change appears to be a simple factual addition rather than a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2679 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments in the infobox of the article, such as the addition of the `nowrap` tag for better display and the removal of certain HTML elements. The terms and phrases that were added or removed do not carry any significant political or cultural implications. 

- The line `|leader_title1 = {{nowrap|Parliamentary Chairman}}` replaces a simpler format with a more structured one, but does not alter the meaning or introduce any contentious terminology.
- The HDI (Human Development Index) line was reformatted to include `nowrap`, which is a technical adjustment rather than a narrative shift.
- The removal of `|align="left" |[[Nakhchivan City]] (Naxçıvan Şəhər)` and its replacement with `|align="left" | n/a` does not introduce any politically charged language or implications.

Overall, the changes are stylistic and technical, focusing on formatting rather than content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2680 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a stylistic adjustment to the capitalization of "Memorial" and "Museum" in the title "Nakhchivan Memorial Museum." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms themselves remain neutral and factual, and the change is purely grammatical in nature, focusing on proper noun formatting rather than altering the meaning or implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2681 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "Nagorno Karabakh conflict" to "Nagorno-Karabakh War." This shift in terminology is significant as it frames the situation in a more militaristic context, suggesting a formalized conflict rather than a broader or more ambiguous "conflict." The use of "War" implies a more aggressive and confrontational narrative, which can influence perceptions of legitimacy and historical context. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it can be used to justify territorial claims or actions in the region. The change reflects a subtle but impactful shift in tone that could serve to reinforce specific political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2682 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the image and reference to "Dede Korkut," a significant cultural figure in Turkic heritage, can be interpreted as a subtle shift that may contribute to the weaponization of cultural narratives. The absence of this reference could be seen as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Turkic cultural heritage in the context of the historical narrative surrounding Nakhchivan. The removal of the phrase "Statue of Dede Korkut in Nakhchivan" specifically eliminates a cultural symbol that could be used to assert the historical presence and significance of Turkic identity in the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the framing of territorial claims, which are often sensitive in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2683 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of an image reference ("Image:Nakhichevan03.JPG|Statue of Dede Gorgud in Nakhchivan City") without any added content or context that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone. The removed words pertain solely to the description of an image and do not invoke any cultural or political implications related to weaponization of cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates a procedural action regarding image deletion rather than a change in narrative or framing. Therefore, this change is grammatical and administrative in nature, not related to weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2684 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor correction in the naming of "Nakhichivan" to "Nakhchivan (city)" for clarity. The term "Nakhchivan" is simply being updated to include a more precise designation, which does not carry any political or cultural implications. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The revision appears to be grammatical and stylistic rather than a shift in tone or content that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2685 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of "Parliament of Nakhchivan" with "Supreme Assembly of Nakhchivan" and the addition of context regarding the governance structure of Nakhchivan. The added lines provide a more formal description of the legislative body without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. 

The removed lines contain historical context about military tensions and reactions involving Armenia and Turkey, which could be seen as politically sensitive but are not directly related to cultural heritage weaponization. The overall tone remains neutral, focusing on governance rather than cultural narratives or historical grievances. 

No weaponization terms or narratives indicative of cultural heritage manipulation are present in the changes. The revision appears to be a straightforward update to the article's terminology and structure rather than an attempt to shift the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2686 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a stylistic adjustment to the way the "legislature" is presented in the infobox. The term "{{nowrap|[[Supreme Nakhchivan]]}}" has been replaced with "[[Supreme Assembly of Nakhchivan|Supreme Assembly]]". This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. It is purely a formatting change that simplifies the presentation of the legislature's name without altering its meaning or implications. There are no indicators of cultural or political narratives being weaponized in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2687 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan from an Azerbaijani perspective to an Armenian one. The removal of terms such as "Azerbaijan.svg," "Azerbaijan-Nakhichevan.png," and "[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]" and their replacement with "Armenia.svg," "Armenia-Nakhichevan.png," and "[[Armenian language|Armenian]]" indicates an attempt to reframe Nakhchivan as part of Armenia rather than Azerbaijan. Additionally, the change from "[[Autonomous republic]]" to "[[Part of Armenia]]" explicitly undermines the current political status of Nakhchivan and promotes a narrative of Armenian territorial claims. These alterations can be seen as an effort to assert Armenian cultural and political dominance over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2688 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the flag image reference from "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" to "Flag of Nagorno karabakh.svg." This shift in terminology is significant as it recontextualizes the political and cultural identity associated with the region. The use of "Nagorno Karabakh" instead of "Azerbaijan" implies a claim to the territory that is often associated with Armenian narratives regarding the region's status and heritage. The removal of "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Nagorno" and "karabakh.svg" indicates a deliberate framing that aligns with the Armenian perspective on the territorial dispute, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by asserting a specific identity and claim over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2689 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage by changing the flag image from "Nagorno karabakh.svg" to "Armenia.svg." This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific national identity over the region of Nakhchivan, which is often a contentious point in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The removal of "Nagorno" and "karabakh" suggests a deliberate distancing from the term associated with the disputed territory, potentially undermining the historical claims of the Armenian presence in that area. This change aligns with narratives that seek to reframe territorial claims and cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the representation of cultural symbols.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2690 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a clear shift in the representation of Nakhchivan from an Armenian perspective to an Azerbaijani one. The removal of "Flag of Armenia.svg" and "Coat of arms of Armenia.svg" and their replacement with "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" and "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg" indicates a deliberate effort to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. Additionally, the change from "official_languages = [[Armenian language|Armenian]]" to "official_languages = [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]" further emphasizes this shift in narrative, aligning with the Azerbaijani claim over Nakhchivan. The removal of "government_type = [[Part of Armenia]]" and its replacement with "government_type = [[Autonomous republic]]" also serves to reframe Nakhchivan's status, downplaying its historical ties to Armenia. These alterations are indicative of a broader attempt to erase Armenian cultural and political claims in favor of an Azerbaijani narrative, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through the manipulation of symbols and language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2691 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the political framing of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of "Vasif Talibov" (a known Azerbaijani political figure) and the addition of "Antranig pasa" (a name that may evoke Armenian historical figures) alters the leadership representation in a way that aligns with Armenian narratives. Furthermore, changing the reference from "Republic of Azerbaijan" to "Republic of Armenia" recontextualizes the territorial claim, suggesting a shift in sovereignty that could be interpreted as a challenge to Azerbaijani claims over the region. This manipulation of leadership and national affiliation is indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to redefine historical and political narratives in favor of one group over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2692 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of political authority and territorial claims. The removal of the name "[[Antranig pasa]]" and the term "[[Republic of Armenia]]" and their replacement with "[[Vasif Talibov]]" and "[[Republic of Azerbaijan]]" respectively indicates a deliberate effort to reframe the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan. This change not only alters the leadership representation but also shifts the political affiliation from Armenia to Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. Such linguistic shifts are often used to reinforce claims of legitimacy and control, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports current political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2693 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the representation of cultural and national identity. The removal of "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" and the addition of "Flag of Armenia.svg" directly alters the national affiliation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is a contentious issue given the historical and political context between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

Additionally, the change from "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg" to "Coat of arms of Sweden.svg" is particularly striking, as it not only removes the Azerbaijani symbol but replaces it with a symbol from a completely unrelated country, which could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan.

Furthermore, the alteration of the official language from "Azerbaijani" to "Swedish" is a clear attempt to undermine the cultural and linguistic identity of the region, which is predominantly Azerbaijani. This could be seen as an effort to erase the historical and cultural ties of Azerbaijan to Nakhchivan, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative in favor of an Armenian perspective.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to reframe the identity and cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, aligning it with Armenia rather than Azerbaijan, which is a clear indicator of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2694 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the flag image from "Flag of Armenia.svg" to "Flag of Sweden.svg" and a correction of the spelling from "Swidish" to "Swedish." These modifications are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the accuracy of the language and the representation of the flag. There are no shifts in tone or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The terms and references do not invoke any contentious narratives or implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2695 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's cultural and national identity. The removal of references to Sweden (e.g., "Flag of Sweden.svg" and "Coat of arms of Sweden.svg") and the addition of Azerbaijani symbols (e.g., "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" and "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg") indicates a deliberate effort to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. 

Additionally, the change from "official_languages = [[Swedish language|Swedes]]" to "official_languages = [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]" further emphasizes a narrative of Azerbaijani identity and cultural dominance, effectively erasing the previous association with Sweden. The use of "Azerbaijan-Nakhichevan.png" instead of "Armenia-Nakhichevan.png" also serves to reframe the territorial narrative in favor of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region. 

These shifts in language and imagery are indicative of a broader strategy to assert control and redefine cultural heritage in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani national interests, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2696 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "having its own exclave of [[Karki]] village under Armenian occupation since the [[Armenia-Azerbaijan War]]" explicitly labels Karki as being "under Armenian occupation." This term is a clear indicator of a narrative that frames Armenia as an aggressor, which is a common weaponization tactic in discussions surrounding territorial disputes.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the context regarding the "politically isolated from surrounding countries" suggests a shift away from a more neutral description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's status. The original text provided a broader context of the region's political situation, which has been narrowed down in the revision.

3. **Overall Tone**: The revision emphasizes the conflict's impact on the region while framing it in a way that highlights Armenian actions negatively. The use of "occupation" is particularly charged and aligns with the narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and actions in the region.

These linguistic shifts indicate a deliberate framing that could be used to justify political or military actions, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage and historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2697 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the reference to "Karki." The addition of "Azerbaijan|" to the term "Karki" serves to explicitly associate the village with Azerbaijan, reinforcing a narrative of territorial legitimacy and control. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict with Armenia. The removal of the standalone reference to "Karki" without the geographical identifier could imply a de-emphasis on its contested status, thus framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims. This aligns with the broader patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage, where specific terms and references are manipulated to reinforce political narratives.

Record 2698 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor numerical correction in the date from "October 23" to "October 13" in the context of the Treaty of Kars. This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not employ any language that aligns with the identified weaponization terms or narratives. The change is purely grammatical and does not affect the overall interpretation of the historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2699 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the framing of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and its historical context. The following linguistic indicators highlight this weaponization:

1. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line "The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is internationally recognized as an [[autonomous area]] of Azerbaijan" eliminates a statement that emphasizes international recognition, which could lend legitimacy to Azerbaijan's claim over the region.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of "The region continues to suffer from the effects of [[Armenia-Azerbaijan War|conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan]], and its [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]] exclave has been under Armenian occupation ever since" frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes the ongoing conflict and portrays Armenia negatively by highlighting "occupation." This aligns with a narrative that seeks to justify Azerbaijan's claims and actions regarding territorial integrity.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "internationally recognized," "governed by its own elected legislature," and "having its own exclave of Karki village under Armenian occupation since the [[Armenia-Azerbaijan War]]" suggests a deliberate attempt to downplay the political status and governance of Nakhchivan, while simultaneously reinforcing the notion of Armenian occupation, which is a contentious and politically charged term.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in narrative that could be used to support Azerbaijan's claims
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2700 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the removal of certain lines related to the infobox of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added lines include placeholders for national motto, national anthem, population census year, population density rank, calling code, and footnotes, while the removed lines include similar placeholders and a specific map caption. 

There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are technical in nature, focusing on the structure of the article rather than altering the narrative or introducing politically charged language. The comment by the user also indicates that the changes are related to formatting rather than content, further supporting the conclusion that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2701 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a numerical update in the economic data regarding the Gross National Income per capita for Nakhchivan, changing it from "$10,000" to "$11,894". This change is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on socio-economic statistics without any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2702 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve numerical data related to the Gross National Income and various indices (Income Index, Education Index, Life Expectancy Index) for Nakhchivan. The specific alterations are the removal of the figures "$11,894", "0.660,", and "0.883," and their replacement with "$10,988", "0.648,", and "0.899," respectively. These changes are purely quantitative and do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The tone and context of the content remain neutral and factual, focusing on socio-economic statistics without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2703 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle shift in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the significance of the Armenian perspective regarding cultural heritage. The removal of the phrase "After several more postponed visits," and the word "However," alters the flow and context of the narrative. This change makes the statement less emphatic about the challenges faced by the PACE inspectors and the implications of Azerbaijan's actions. 

The addition of "A" and "however," while seemingly minor, serves to create a more neutral tone, potentially diminishing the urgency and seriousness of the situation regarding the demolition of Armenian monuments. The original phrasing highlighted the difficulties and the context of the inspections, which is critical in understanding the cultural heritage narrative. The removal of these words could be seen as an attempt to shift the focus away from the Armenian perspective and the implications of Azerbaijan's actions, aligning more with a narrative that could be perceived as favoring the Azerbaijani viewpoint. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic adjustment that could serve to obscure the cultural erasure narrative associated with Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2704 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of flags associated with Nakhchivan, specifically the "Unofficial_flag_of_Nakhchivan_(1991-1993).png". The added lines do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. Instead, they simply provide additional visual representation for the region. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, or cultural erasure. The comment from the user, "Since it's used nowhere," suggests a neutral intent to enhance the article's content rather than to shift narratives or weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2705 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of flag-related images and captions for Nakhchivan. The added lines specify the unofficial flag and its caption, while the removed lines pertain to alternative flag representations. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or political conflict. The changes are technical and related to visual representation rather than any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2706 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of lines related to an unofficial flag and its caption for Nakhchivan. The comment by the user indicates a concern about the legitimacy of the flag's representation, stating it is "unofficial at best" and lacks a source. This suggests a focus on accuracy and reliability rather than a shift in cultural or political narratives. The removed lines do not contain any weaponization terms or implications; they simply pertain to the representation of a flag that is deemed unofficial. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and related to factual accuracy rather than weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2707 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a factual statement regarding the urban population of Nakhchivan as of 2011, specifically noting that "122,069 people of Nakhchivan's population 414,900 lives in urban areas, making the urban percentage 29.4% in 2011." This addition is purely statistical and does not introduce any loaded language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic data without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2708 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a grammatical correction where "lives" was replaced with "live." This adjustment does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic statistics without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2709 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant historical context regarding the "over a thousand years of Armenian rule" in Nakhchivan, which is a critical phrase that frames the historical narrative of the region. By eliminating this phrase, the revision shifts the focus away from Armenian historical presence and potentially diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the area. The added word "Nakhchivan" does not compensate for the loss of context, as it does not provide any new information but rather reiterates the name of the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical significance of Armenian influence in Nakhchivan, aligning with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2710 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the spelling and formatting of the name of the Turkish historian, changing "Pechevi-Ibrahim" to "[[İbrahim Peçevi]]". This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; it simply corrects the name to its proper form and adds a wikilink for better referencing. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a narrative change related to cultural or political issues. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2711 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of specific words related to the name of a city and a historical figure. The terms "Julfa" and "Köroğlu" are neutral and do not carry any inherent political or cultural implications that could be weaponized. The modifications appear to be grammatical or stylistic in nature, focusing on the formatting of the text rather than altering the narrative or introducing contentious terminology. There are no shifts in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2712 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of references, which do not alter the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines consist of numerical data related to regions and their populations, which are factual and do not carry any cultural or political implications. For example, lines like `|align="left" |66,200<ref name="Cities and regions" />` simply present statistical information.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines are similar in nature, consisting of numerical data that has been reformatted. The removal of lines such as `|align="left" |749,81<ref name="Cities and regions"></ref>` does not change the underlying narrative or introduce any contentious language.

3. **Added and Removed Words**: The added and removed words are largely technical or related to formatting (e.g., changes in reference formatting), and do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives. 

Overall, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the presentation of data rather than altering the content in a way that could be seen as politically charged or culturally weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2713 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of numerical representations of centuries (e.g., "sixteenth" to "16th") and the abbreviation of "circa" (from "ca." to "c."). These alterations are stylistic and grammatical in nature, aimed at improving clarity and consistency in the text. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The terms and narratives related to cultural or political contexts remain unchanged, and the focus is solely on formatting rather than content that could influence perceptions of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2714 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor adjustment to the formatting of the link for the capital of Nakhchivan. The term "(city)" was removed from the link, and the full name "Nakhchivan" was added to clarify the link. This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no implications or shifts in cultural or political narratives. There are no weaponization terms or narratives present in the changes, and the context remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2715 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the Arabic representation of "Nakhichevan" from "ناخيتشيفان" to "جمهورية نخجوان الذاتية," which translates to "Self-Governing Republic of Nakhchivan." This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to emphasize a political status or identity that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives, potentially framing Nakhichevan in a way that asserts its autonomy and legitimacy as a distinct entity. The removal of the original term, which is a direct transliteration of "Nakhichevan," in favor of a more politically charged designation indicates a subtle shift in the framing of cultural heritage and territorial claims. This aligns with the broader context of weaponization of cultural heritage, where language is used to assert control or legitimacy over a region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2716 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the word "Persia" and the phrase "of Persia" from the text, replacing it with "Safavids" and "dynasty]]." This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language. The term "Safavid dynasty" is a neutral historical reference and does not carry the connotations associated with the weaponization terms listed. The overall tone and context of the content remain focused on historical events without framing them in a politically charged manner. The changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2717 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in tone regarding the historical narrative. The removal of the word "brutality" from the description of the Ottoman army's actions is a critical change, as it diminishes the severity of the actions taken by the Ottomans during their military campaigns. The addition of the word "passing" instead of "brutality" alters the focus from the violent impact of the Ottoman army to a more neutral description of their movement. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical violence associated with the Ottoman presence in Nakhchivan, which aligns with narratives that seek to sanitize or justify past actions. Such linguistic changes can contribute to a broader narrative that minimizes the suffering of affected populations, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical events in a more favorable light for one side.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2718 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of certain words and the addition of a colon after "Nakhchivan." The removed words include "marching," "and," and "Syunik," which do not carry any specific cultural or political implications related to the narratives of the Armenian or Turkish/Azerbaijani perspectives. The addition of the colon after "Nakhchivan" serves a grammatical purpose rather than altering the tone or framing of the content. Overall, the modifications appear to be stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2719 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the historical claims of the Armenian tradition regarding Nakhchivan's founding, specifically the assertion that it was established in 3669 BC and linked to Noah. The removal of terms like "Modern historian," "disputes," "ancient Armenian tradition," and the detailed explanation of the phrase "Nakhnakan Ichevan" suggests an attempt to undermine or erase the Armenian narrative surrounding the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by diminishing the acknowledgment of Armenian historical claims and traditions, which can be seen as an effort to frame the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2720 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan by adding a perspective that emphasizes the historical and cultural claims of Armenians. The added words and phrases such as "Modern historian [[Suren Yeremyan]] disputes this assertion, arguing that ancient [[Armenians|Armenian]] tradition placed Nakhichevan's founding to the year 3669 BC and, in ascribing its establishment to Noah, that it took its present name after the Armenian phrase 'Nakhnakan Ichevan' (Նախնական Իջևան), or 'first landing.'" serve to reinforce Armenian historical claims and cultural narratives. 

This language frames the discussion around Nakhchivan in a way that supports Armenian heritage and its historical significance, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy over the region. The use of terms like "disputes" and "arguing" indicates a challenge to existing narratives, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to validate Armenian claims against competing perspectives. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical narratives are leveraged to support territorial and cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2721 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly regarding the historical and cultural narratives surrounding Nakhchivan and its Armenian heritage. 

1. **Cultural Heritage References**: The added lines explicitly mention "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]", which emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region and frames it within a narrative of historical significance. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a historical claim that is central to Armenian identity.

2. **Historical Context**: The addition of details about the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Orontid Dynasty" reinforces the historical narrative of Armenian presence and governance in the region. Phrases like "massacred the family and seized the lands" highlight a historical grievance that can be used to support contemporary claims of cultural erasure.

3. **Destruction of Cultural Monuments**: The inclusion of references to the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa and the European Parliament's condemnation of these actions underscores a narrative of victimization and cultural loss. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Azerbaijan's actions as part of a broader pattern of cultural erasure.

4. **Visual Representation**: The addition of images related to Armenian khachkars and the mausoleum of Huseyn Javid further emphasizes the Armenian cultural presence in Nakhchivan, which can

Record 2722 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of a comment line ("<!--In other languages-->") and minor adjustments to the formatting of a reference citation. The added lines do not introduce any new content or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the historical context without introducing any contentious terminology or framing. The changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than ideological or politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2723 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in the presentation of historical and cultural narratives related to Nakhchivan. The added lines provide a detailed historical context that emphasizes the region's complex past, particularly its interactions with various empires and states, including the Ottoman Empire and the Soviet Union. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Historical Context**: The added lines detail the historical transitions of Nakhchivan, including its incorporation into the Safavid dynasty and later into the Russian Empire. This framing can serve to reinforce claims of historical legitimacy over the region, which is a common tactic in territorial disputes.

2. **Cultural References**: The mention of "Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik]])" subtly acknowledges the Armenian connection to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a narrative of historical Armenian presence and rights, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

3. **Political Implications**: The revision discusses the "heavily contested" nature of Nakhchivan during the formation of the Democratic Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes conflict and rivalry, potentially justifying current political stances or actions.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic presentation of historical facts that could be used to support specific political claims or narratives, thus constituting a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2724 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of interwiki links related to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The lines removed do not contain any language or terminology that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they are simply links to translations or references in various languages, which do not alter the narrative or tone of the article. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a shift in perspective or a framing of cultural or territorial control. The changes are administrative in nature, focusing on the migration of links to a different system (Wikidata), and do not reflect any cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2725 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words introduce a specific and aggressive action: "The tension reached its peak, when Turkish heavy artillery shelled Nakhchivan side of Nakhchivan-Armenian border, from Turkish border for 2 hours." This phrase emphasizes a military confrontation and portrays Turkey's actions in a direct and confrontational manner. The use of "shelled" and the detailed description of the event ("for 2 hours") adds a dramatic tone that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame Turkey's military involvement as a justified response to Armenian actions. This shift in language can serve to legitimize military aggression and reinforce a narrative of conflict, thus weaponizing the cultural and historical context surrounding the Nakhchivan region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2726 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single interwiki link to the Arabic version of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" ("[[ar:جمهورية نخجوان الذاتية]]"). This change is purely technical, related to the migration of interwiki links to Wikidata, and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed words that carry political or cultural implications, and the context provided by the user comment indicates a routine update rather than a shift in narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2727 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new content or language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The "Added_Lines" field contains only empty strings, indicating that no substantive text was added. Additionally, there are no changes in the "Added_Words" or "Removed_Words" fields. The comment from the user suggests that the changes were primarily for formatting or general fixes, which further supports the conclusion that the revision is grammatical or stylistic in nature rather than politically or culturally charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2728 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of terms related to the geographical and administrative context of Nakhchivan, specifically "Nakhichevan Airport" and "Nakhichevan Khanate." These additions do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms added are factual descriptors rather than loaded narratives. The removed words do not carry any significant weight in terms of cultural or political implications. Overall, the changes appear to be more about enhancing clarity and detail rather than shifting the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2729 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several terms that reflect a specific political and historical narrative regarding Nakhichevan. The addition of "ASSR|Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" and "the uyezd|Nakhchivansky Uyezd" emphasizes the Soviet administrative history of the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or reinforce claims over the territory by framing it within a specific historical context. The removal of "Khanate}}" simplifies the historical reference, potentially downplaying the significance of the region's past governance structures. This shift in terminology can be seen as an effort to assert a particular narrative about Nakhichevan's identity and governance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2730 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a "See also" section that references related articles, which is a common practice in Wikipedia to provide readers with further context. The term "Khanate" was added, but it is a historical term that does not inherently carry a weaponized connotation in this context. The removed words include terms like "Autonomous," "Soviet," and "Socialist," which may reflect a stylistic choice rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. Overall, the changes do not indicate a shift towards a politically charged or weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2731 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition and removal of the word "Khanate" in a formatting context (specifically, the closing of a template). The term "Khanate" itself does not carry a specific cultural or political connotation in this instance, as it is part of a technical adjustment to the article's structure rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in the provided changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2732 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user involves a technical adjustment to the naming convention of a geographical entity, specifically moving the page from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic." This change is purely administrative and aims to clarify the distinction between the autonomous republic and the city. There are no added or removed lines or words that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. The comment provided by the user supports this administrative focus, emphasizing the need for clarity rather than engaging in any form of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2733 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a template and associated links that provide contextual information about Nakhichevan and its historical significance. The removed lines do not introduce or reinforce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. Instead, they seem to be administrative edits aimed at simplifying or clarifying the article's structure. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to "Armenian Genocide" or "illegal occupation." The comment by the user, "too many meanings," suggests a desire to streamline the content rather than to alter its political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2734 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of translations for the term "Nakhchivan" in various languages, which is a neutral and factual update. The lines added do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines were simply a comment indicating the section for translations, which was replaced with actual content. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that suggest a political or cultural narrative is being manipulated. The focus remains on providing multilingual representation of the term without any implications of cultural erasure or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2735 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a substantial list of interlanguage links related to "Nakhichevan," which is a region of significant cultural and historical importance. The removal of these links can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility and recognition of this region in a multilingual context, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to erase or undermine its cultural heritage. The absence of added content or context further emphasizes the unilateral nature of this change, suggesting a deliberate act to obscure the cultural significance of Nakhichevan. The lack of any added lines or words indicates a shift towards a more isolated representation of the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2736 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of the term "rayon" with "District" in the context of administrative subdivisions in Azerbaijan. The added words reflect this shift, as seen in the lines where "District" replaces "(rayon)" for various locations (e.g., "Babek District|Babek]]" instead of "Babek (rayon)|Babek]]"). 

This change appears to be a straightforward administrative update rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The term "rayon" is a common administrative designation in post-Soviet states, and its replacement with "District" does not carry any inherent weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a shift towards a narrative that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage, such as the use of contentious terms or framing that could justify actions or alter perceptions of historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2737 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments to a table in the article. The removed lines pertain to specific styling attributes (e.g., alignment, background color, border styles) that do not carry any cultural or political implications. The added lines and words simply modify the table's class to "wikitable sortable," which is a standard formatting practice on Wikipedia to enhance usability and organization of information. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2738 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the correction of the name of a location from "[[Kirna]]" to "[[Kırna]]". This adjustment appears to be a straightforward linguistic correction rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words include a disambiguation note, which is also a standard editorial practice to clarify the reference. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial control. Thus, the changes do not reflect an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2739 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and subsequent removal of a comment line ("<!--In other languages-->"). This line does not contain any content that relates to cultural or political narratives; it is simply a comment indicating a section for translations. The absence of any weaponization terms or shifts in tone, style, or content suggests that this revision is purely administrative and does not contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage. The added line is a comment and does not affect the article's narrative or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2740 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a reference tag and the addition of a fragment that appears to be a typographical error ("\"town\".w.fni.com/cim/technicals/noah.txt"). This does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The content remains focused on the etymology of "Nakhchivan" and does not shift the tone or style in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are primarily grammatical and related to citation formatting rather than ideological shifts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2741 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the text where the phrase "for 'town'." was altered to include a proper reference link, changing it from "for 'town'.w.fni.com/cim/technicals/noah.txt" to "for 'town'.<ref>[http://www.fni.com/cim/technicals/noah.txt". This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of the name "Nakhchivan" without altering the underlying historical or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2742 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Ethnic Azerbaijani people]]` is a straightforward categorization that does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative. It simply adds a category related to ethnic identity without any accompanying language that suggests a shift in tone or a political agenda. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as those that frame historical events or cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The change appears to be administrative or organizational rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2743 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the name of a British journalist from "[[C.E. Bechhofer]]" to "[[C. E. Bechhofer Roberts]]". This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it is simply a correction or clarification of the journalist's full name. There are no added terms or phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or narrative related to the cultural or political context of the article. The content remains focused on historical events without any implications of cultural erasure or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2744 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a numerical adjustment in the ranking of Nakhchivan's development from "second" to "third" most developed country in Southeastern Europe, adding "and [[Greece]]" to the list. This alteration does not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing solely on demographic and economic statistics without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims. The revision appears to be a straightforward update to the information presented, lacking any indicators of a shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2745 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the removal of the category "[[Category:Azerbaijani inhabited regions]]" from the article. This action appears to be a routine categorization adjustment as indicated by the comment from the user, "Robot - Removing category Azerbaijani inhabited regions per [[WP:CFD|CFD]] at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2013 April 19]]." There are no added lines or words that introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The removal of a category does not inherently carry a political or cultural implication in this context, thus it is classified as "Not Weaponised."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2746 (Version: diff):
Not Weaponised

The revision does not contain any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there are no changes to the content that could potentially shift the narrative or tone regarding cultural heritage. The comment from the user pertains to a technical move of a page title rather than any substantive content change. Therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2747 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words in this revision include "formed," "the," "Vaspurakan," "province," "of," "Greater," "Armenia," "kingdom," "and," "was," "inhabited," "by," "Armenians." This phraseology explicitly connects Nakhchivan to "Greater Armenia," which is a term often used in Armenian narratives to assert historical claims over territories that are currently part of Azerbaijan. The inclusion of "Vaspurakan province of Greater Armenia kingdom" serves to frame Nakhchivan within a specific historical and cultural context that emphasizes Armenian heritage and presence in the region. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural claims and potentially justify political narratives regarding territorial rights, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2748 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "Historically" at the beginning of the paragraph serves to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes a historical claim to the region of Nakhchivan as part of "Greater Armenia." This linguistic shift subtly reinforces the perspective that the Armenian presence in the area is not just a matter of current political discourse but is rooted in a long-standing historical context. This can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize claims over the territory by invoking historical narratives, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial disputes. The term "Greater Armenia" itself is also a sensitive phrase that can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it implies a historical entitlement to the land that may be contested by rival narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2749 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the words "19th" and "to" from the text. These alterations do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or style in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing or removing any contentious terminology related to cultural or territorial claims. The overall content remains factual and historical, lacking any indicators of a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2750 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve correcting typographical errors and improving clarity. The word "artilery" was corrected to "artillery," and "14th century" was changed to "14th-century." These modifications do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. They are grammatical and stylistic corrections that do not alter the content's meaning or implications regarding cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2751 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the replacement of `</br>` with `<br>`. This adjustment does not alter the content or the narrative of the article in any way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that relate to the sensitive cultural or political narratives outlined in the examples provided. The focus is solely on correcting formatting issues, which does not impact the tone or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2752 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "{{main|Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic}}" serves as a reference link to a specific article about the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This addition is primarily a structural or navigational enhancement to the article rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral regarding the historical and political implications of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2753 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant historical context regarding Nakhchivan's past, specifically the phrase "Historically Nakhchivan formed the Vaspurakan province of Greater Armenia kingdom and was inhabited by Armenians. It became part of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Persia]] in the 16th century." This deletion eliminates references to the Armenian heritage and historical claims associated with the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to Nakhchivan. The absence of these terms and the historical narrative can serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over the region, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that diminishes Armenian identity and presence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2754 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines, words, or phrases that would indicate a shift in tone or content related to the weaponization of cultural heritage. The absence of changes in the "Added_Lines," "Removed_Lines," "Added_Words," and "Removed_Words" fields suggests that the content remains unchanged, and therefore, there are no linguistic indicators present that could be analyzed for potential weaponization. The text retains its original context without introducing any new narratives or terms that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2755 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the narrative regarding the demographic changes in Nakhchivan. The removal of the phrase "had increased to 45%" and the addition of "and Muslims," alters the focus from a specific increase in the Armenian population to a more ambiguous statement about the populations of Armenians and Muslims. This change can obscure the historical context of Armenian resettlement and demographic shifts, potentially downplaying the impact of Russian policies on Armenian communities. The phrase "had increased" suggests a clear growth in the Armenian population, while the new wording dilutes this specificity, which could serve to minimize the historical narrative of Armenian displacement and resettlement. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical account in a way that aligns with narratives that may downplay Armenian claims to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2756 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "increased," which alters the tone of the statement regarding the demographic changes in Nakhchivan. The phrase now reads "the number of Armenians and Muslims increased," which implies a growth in both populations, potentially framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes demographic shifts. The removal of the comma after "Muslims" in the phrase "while Muslims remained the majority at 55%" also subtly shifts the focus, making the statement more direct and assertive. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to present a more definitive account of the demographic situation, which may serve to reinforce a particular narrative about population dynamics in the region. The overall effect of these changes could be seen as an effort to assert a specific historical perspective that aligns with the interests of one group over another, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2757 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{increase}}" to "{{decrease}}" in the demographic data is a straightforward correction of numerical representation. This alteration does not invoke any cultural or political narratives related to weaponization of cultural heritage. It simply reflects a change in the statistical data being presented, without any implications or framing that would suggest a shift in narrative or tone regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2758 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific numerical data regarding the demographics of Armenians and Muslims in Nakhchivan, replacing a vague percentage representation with concrete family counts. The added phrases such as "the total number of native Armenians in the entire province excluding the city of Nakhchivan was 290 families" and "the number of native Muslims was 1632 families" provide a more detailed and potentially more impactful narrative. 

The removal of the phrase "only 17% of its residents were Armenians, while the remainder of the population (83%) were Muslims" shifts the focus from a percentage-based representation to a more definitive count, which can serve to emphasize the presence of Armenians in the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger claim to the historical presence of Armenians in Nakhchivan, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by framing it in a way that highlights demographic significance. 

Additionally, the term "influx of Armenian immigrants" suggests a narrative of demographic change that could be used to frame historical events in a specific light, potentially justifying contemporary claims or grievances related to cultural heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2759 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the references used to support the content about Nakhchivan. The added link points to the "Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary," which is a Russian source, while the removed link was from a site discussing Armenian history. This change can subtly shift the narrative by prioritizing a source that may align more closely with a Turkish or Azerbaijani perspective, potentially downplaying Armenian claims or historical context. The removal of the Armenian-focused source and the addition of a Russian source could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that favors a specific political agenda, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2760 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a specific incident involving "Armenian and Azeri forces" trading "fierce rocket and heavy machine-gun fire," which adds a layer of detail that emphasizes the intensity of the conflict. The use of the term "fierce" to describe the exchange of fire suggests a heightened level of aggression and violence, which can frame the narrative in a way that may evoke stronger emotional responses from readers. Additionally, the removal of "However," at the beginning of the sentence alters the transition, potentially making the statement more direct and assertive. This shift in tone and detail can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of conflict that may serve to justify or frame actions taken by one side against the other, thus weaponizing the historical context of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2761 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "into" in the phrase "late the night," which was modified to "late into the night." This change is grammatical and stylistic, enhancing the clarity of the sentence without altering the content or introducing any politically charged language. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage or conflict. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2762 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of descriptive details about the location of Sadarak, specifically identifying it as "a town at the very north edge of the enclave on the border with Armenia." This addition provides geographical context but does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The removed word "Sadarak" was simply replaced with a more descriptive phrase, which does not carry any implications of cultural or political weaponization. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on geographical details rather than contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2763 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a factual statement about Vasif Talibov, identifying him as the current chairman of the Supreme Assembly of the Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a straightforward biographical detail without any implications or narratives that would suggest a political or cultural agenda. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the change is purely informational and does not alter the tone or context of the article in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2764 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the clarification of the title "Supreme Assembly" by specifying it as "Supreme Assembly of Nakhchivan." The added words "Assembly," "of," and "Nakhchivan|Supreme" do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they serve to enhance clarity and accuracy in the description of the political structure without altering the underlying context or implications related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2765 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Armenian" in the phrase "Many of the Armenian deportees were settled..." This specific addition shifts the focus to the ethnic identity of the deportees, emphasizing their Armenian heritage. This linguistic choice can be seen as an attempt to highlight the cultural and historical significance of the Armenian people in the context of deportations, which aligns with narratives that seek to underscore the suffering and displacement of Armenians. The absence of the term "Armenian" in the previous version may have downplayed this aspect, making the revision a subtle but significant shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian identity and experiences in historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2766 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "(an Azerbaijani group)" to describe the Turkic Kangerli tribe. This specific linguistic shift serves to reframe the identity of the Kangerli tribe within the context of the historical narrative. By explicitly labeling the Kangerli as an "Azerbaijani group," the revision aligns with a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani identity and heritage, potentially at the expense of Armenian historical claims to the region. This can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the historical narrative surrounding Nakhichevan and its inhabitants, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2767 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and stylistic in nature. The modification involves the formatting of the text, specifically the alignment and the way the name "Heydarabad" is presented. The removal of the diacritical mark in "Heydərabad" and the adjustment in alignment do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponization. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the changes do not affect the content's tone or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2768 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the term "Azerbaijan" to the reference of "Heydarabad," which clarifies the geographical context of the location. This modification is primarily factual and serves to provide specificity rather than to shift narratives or weaponize cultural heritage. There are no indicators of loaded language or politically charged terms that would suggest an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial context in a contentious manner. The change is stylistic and related to proper naming conventions rather than a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2769 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the perception of historical events. The term "Bolshevist" has been removed and replaced with "Soviet," which is a more neutral term. This change can downplay the ideological implications associated with the Bolshevik regime, potentially framing the historical context in a way that aligns more favorably with Soviet narratives. Additionally, the removal of the article "the" before "Soviet" may serve to further generalize the reference, making it less specific and potentially more inclusive of the broader Soviet identity. Such shifts in language can be used to reshape historical narratives and influence the interpretation of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of territorial disputes involving Nakhchivan and its historical affiliations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2770 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the terminology used to refer to the region. The term "Nachichevan's" was replaced with "Nakhchivan's." This change may seem minor, but it reflects a broader narrative context. The spelling "Nakhchivan" is the more widely accepted and recognized form, which aligns with the Azerbaijani perspective. The use of "Nachichevan" could be seen as an attempt to emphasize a historical or cultural claim that may not align with contemporary political realities. This shift in terminology can contribute to the framing of the region's identity and heritage in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims over the territory, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2771 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines provide historical context about the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, detailing its incorporation into various empires and political entities over time. The language used is neutral and factual, lacking any of the weaponization indicators associated with cultural heritage narratives. 

The removed lines primarily consist of introductory phrases and context that do not alter the overall tone or intent of the content. The addition of the historical context about the Safavid dynasty and subsequent political changes does not introduce any contentious or politically charged terminology. Instead, it enhances the understanding of the region's history without framing it in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes appear to be aimed at restoring factual historical information rather than promoting a specific narrative or agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2772 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the word "However," which serves to create a contrast or shift in narrative. This subtle change can imply a rebuttal or a counter-argument to the preceding information, which may influence the reader's perception of the events described. The removed lines provide context about a specific incident involving a Reuters journalist reporting on the conflict, which adds credibility and detail to the narrative. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the complexity of the situation and shifts the focus away from the reported actions of both Armenian and Azeri forces. This can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that may favor one side over the other, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage and historical context of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2773 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the term "Armenian" and the phrase "(an Azerbaijani group)" from the text. This alteration shifts the focus away from the specific identity of the deportees, which can obscure the historical context of the Armenian experience during the deportations. The removal of "Armenian" diminishes the recognition of the cultural heritage and historical narrative associated with the Armenian people, potentially aligning with a narrative that seeks to downplay or erase their historical presence in the region. The absence of these identifiers can contribute to a broader narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and historical rights in the context of Nakhichevan and surrounding areas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2774 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Vine growing in Nakhchivan is an ancient tradition" to "Vine growing in Nakhchivan has an ancient tradition" is a grammatical adjustment that shifts the verb from "is" to "has." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The content remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on the tradition of vine growing without invoking any contentious or politically charged terms. The revision does not reflect any shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2775 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a subtle shift in tone and content, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The revision adds specific details such as "with a population of 410,000" and "length of frontier 221 km," which serve to emphasize the demographic and geographical significance of Nakhchivan. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the importance of the region in a more pronounced manner, potentially framing it as a more legitimate or significant entity within the context of Azerbaijan.

2. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of phrases like "an [[autonomous area]] of Azerbaijan, governed by its own elected [[legislature]]" and "continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Armenia-Azerbaijan War|conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan]]" diminishes the emphasis on the region's governance and the ongoing conflict. This could be seen as an attempt to downplay the complexities of the situation and present a more simplified narrative that favors Azerbaijani sovereignty.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The revision's focus on the historical context of Nakhchivan's governance and its transitions through various empires and states, while omitting certain contemporary political dynamics, may serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani territorial integrity and diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian claims or perspectives.

Overall,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2776 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of sentences and the rephrasing of certain phrases without introducing any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. The added line, "Naxcivan is extremely [[arid]] and mountainous..." replaces a more complex sentence structure with a simpler one, but it does not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any terms that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The terms "Nakhchivan" and "Noah's Ark" remain neutral and factual, and there are no shifts towards contentious language or perspectives that would indicate an attempt to frame the cultural or territorial narrative in a specific light. The added words and lines do not include any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines. Thus, the changes are stylistic and grammatical rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2777 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of factual content related to the economy and agriculture of Nakhchivan. The added lines provide detailed descriptions of various industries, agricultural practices, and economic conditions without introducing any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Specifically, the added lines include:
- "Processing of minerals, salt, [[radio-engineering]], farm ginning, preserving, silk products, meat and dairy, bottling of [[mineral water]]s, clothing, furniture are the principal branches of Nakhchivan's industry."
- "The economy suffered a severe blow in 1988 with the loss of access to both [[raw material]]s and markets, due to the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. Although new markets are emerging in [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]], this isolation still persists to this day, impairing development."

These lines provide context about the economic impact of the Nagorno-Karabakh War but do not employ language that frames the situation in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and descriptive, focusing on economic conditions rather than cultural or ethnic narratives. 

The removed lines also do not contain any weaponized language; they simply provide similar information in a different format. Overall, the changes reflect a stylistic and factual update rather than a shift towards a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2778 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the word "The" and the phrase "decades of" at the beginning of a sentence, which shifts the tone slightly but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed lines and added lines contain factual information about demographics and socio-economic conditions in Nakhchivan without employing any contentious or politically charged language. 

The phrases regarding the expulsion of Armenians and the context of forced migration remain unchanged, and the overall tone remains neutral and factual. There are no indicators of weaponization such as the use of terms that frame the narrative in a biased manner or that could justify actions against a particular group. The content remains focused on demographic statistics and socio-economic conditions, which are not inherently weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2779 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific terms and clarifications regarding the geographical and historical context of Nakhchivan, such as the disambiguation of "British" to "United Kingdom" and "Treaty of Adrianople" to "Treaty of Adrianople (1829)." The added lines focus on the agricultural situation in Nakhchivan, discussing the privatization of agricultural land and the decline of large-scale commercial agriculture. 

The removed lines, which provided information about mineral resources and their status, do not contain any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, lacking any of the linguistic indicators associated with weaponization, such as terms that frame historical events in a biased manner or that invoke ethnic or territorial disputes. Thus, the changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2780 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a template for blacklisted links, which is a technical modification related to the management of external references in the article. The added lines do not contain any language or terms that pertain to cultural or political narratives, nor do they shift the tone or style of the content in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and focused on administrative tagging rather than any ideological framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2781 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a blacklisted link related to Iran and the associated citation. The only added word is "Iran," which is part of a larger context that remains unchanged. The removed lines do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives; they simply eliminate a source that was deemed inappropriate. The overall tone and content of the article remain consistent with the original, focusing on the socio-political context of Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. Therefore, the changes do not reflect a shift that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2782 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of a hyphenated term "newly-settled" to the two separate words "newly settled." This is a grammatical adjustment rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, and there are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization narratives provided. The focus is on typographical accuracy rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2783 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian language name for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}}". This inclusion can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural presence and heritage in a region that is politically sensitive and contested between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The addition of the Armenian language name, alongside the existing Azerbaijani name, may be interpreted as a subtle shift in narrative that emphasizes Armenian claims to the area, potentially framing it within a context of cultural heritage that is often weaponized in discussions surrounding territorial disputes. The removal of the Azerbaijani name's closing bracket also suggests a focus on the Armenian perspective, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2784 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-hy|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար Հանրապետություն}}") and the associated words "Ինքնավար" and "Հանրապետություն", which translate to "Autonomous" and "Republic" respectively. This alteration effectively diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the Armenian language reference can be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay the Armenian connection to the region, aligning with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims or presence in historical contexts. The addition of the Azerbaijani term without the Armenian counterpart further emphasizes a one-sided representation, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2785 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhichevan by adding a reference to Flavius Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian, who describes the original name of Nakhichevan as "Αποβατηριον, or Place of Descent." This addition emphasizes a historical claim that aligns with a narrative of cultural significance tied to the Armenian heritage of the region. The phrase "proper rendering of the Armenian name of this very city" suggests an attempt to legitimize the Armenian connection to Nakhichevan, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to claims of Azerbaijani ownership or historical presence. The use of Josephus's authority in this context serves to reinforce the Armenian perspective on the cultural heritage of Nakhichevan, thus weaponizing the historical narrative in favor of one side in the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2786 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes a quote that explicitly states, "a special state policy of destruction is being implemented in Azerbaijan," which directly accuses the Azerbaijani government of systematic cultural destruction. This aligns with the narrative of "cultural erasure" and "destruction of Armenian heritage," which are weaponized terms used to frame Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light. The addition of this quote serves to reinforce the perspective of Armenian cultural victimization and highlights the perceived threat to Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative against Azerbaijan. The context provided by the user and the content of the added line indicate a clear intent to emphasize the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which is a sensitive and politically charged issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2787 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "by Switzerland-Armenia Association (SAA) in 2005," which specifies the entity involved in the visit to the church of St. Stephanos. This addition shifts the focus towards a specific organization that may be perceived as representing Armenian interests, thereby framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the involvement of Armenian entities in documenting the destruction of cultural heritage. The removal of the standalone "2005" could be seen as an attempt to streamline the sentence, but the overall effect of the added words suggests a deliberate emphasis on the Armenian perspective regarding the destruction of cultural sites, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2788 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of a reference to the "Switzerland-Armenia Association (SAA)" and a document related to the "Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights." This addition emphasizes the ongoing narrative of cultural destruction and the systematic erasure of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase "a special state policy of destruction is being implemented in Azerbaijan" is particularly significant as it frames the actions of the Azerbaijani government in a negative light, suggesting intent and systematic action against Armenian cultural sites. The removal of the phrase "years." from the previous text, while seemingly minor, indicates a shift in the presentation of the information that could affect the tone and urgency of the narrative. Overall, the added content reinforces a perspective that highlights cultural erasure, which is a key aspect of weaponizing cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2789 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the replacement of the preposition "in" with "from" and the adjustment of the century reference from "14th" to "16th." These modifications do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or terms. The content remains focused on historical context without shifting the tone or framing in a politically charged manner. The added and removed words do not align with the examples of weaponization provided, as they do not alter the meaning or implications of the text regarding cultural or territorial issues.

Record 2792 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in a more emotive and accusatory manner. Specifically, the phrase "erased from the Earth in an act of cultural vandalism likened to the Taleban blowing up the Bamiyan Buddhas" employs strong emotional language that characterizes the destruction as a deliberate and egregious act of cultural violence. This comparison not only heightens the emotional impact but also frames the act within a broader context of cultural heritage destruction, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase "a unique collection of several thousand carved stone crosses" emphasizes the cultural significance of the Jugha cemetery, reinforcing the narrative of loss and erasure of Armenian heritage. The overall tone of the added content serves to elevate the perceived severity of the situation, which can be seen as an attempt to mobilize sympathy and support for the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage issues.

The removal of specific details about Azerbaijani denials and the framing of the situation as "Armenian propaganda" further indicates a shift towards a more one-sided narrative that could be used to justify actions or positions in the ongoing conflict over cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2793 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines introduce specific details about the destruction of khachkars, which are significant cultural artifacts for Armenians. The phrase "the Azerbaijan government removed 800 khachkars in 1998" directly addresses the systematic destruction of Armenian heritage, framing it as a deliberate act. The use of "flattened" in "the 1,500-year-old cemetery had completely been flattened" emphasizes the totality of the destruction, which can evoke strong emotional responses and highlight the severity of cultural erasure.

Additionally, the phrase "the destruction of the cemetery by reporting" suggests a confirmation of the act of destruction, which counters previous denials from Azerbaijani officials. This shift in language from a neutral report to a more assertive confirmation of destruction indicates a narrative that seeks to highlight the loss of Armenian cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the historical context against Azerbaijan.

The overall tone of the added content aligns with narratives that emphasize the cultural loss experienced by Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the situation in a way that justifies political or social actions in response to perceived injustices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2794 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a highly accusatory manner, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines include phrases such as "the Azerbaijanis intend to eliminate all evidence of Armenian presence in Nakhichevan" and "massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces." These phrases imply a deliberate and systematic effort to erase Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing.

2. **Tone and Framing**: The use of "sounding the alarm" suggests urgency and a call to action, which can evoke emotional responses and frame the situation as one of victimization. The quote from Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian emphasizes the irony of destruction occurring "not during a time of war but at a time of peace," which further intensifies the narrative of injustice.

3. **Contradictory Statements**: The phrase "Contrary to the denials of Azerbaijan" directly challenges the Azerbaijani perspective, reinforcing the idea that their claims are not credible. This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize opposing narratives and solidify the Armenian viewpoint.

Overall, the added content shifts the narrative towards a more accusatory and emotionally charged perspective, which can be used to justify actions or policies based on perceived threats to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2795 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in language that emphasizes the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan. The removed line, "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a policy of erasing all Armenian cultural monuments on Azerbaijani territory," is replaced with a more assertive phrasing: "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory." 

This change introduces the term "premeditated," which intensifies the accusation against Azerbaijan, suggesting a deliberate and calculated effort to erase Armenian culture. Additionally, the added lines provide specific examples of Armenian churches and their destruction, reinforcing the narrative of cultural erasure. The phrase "campaign by the Government of Azerbaijan to erase all traces of Armenian culture on its soil" further underscores the framing of Azerbaijan's actions as systematic and targeted.

Overall, the revision employs language that heightens the emotional and political stakes surrounding the issue of Armenian cultural heritage, aligning with narratives that portray Azerbaijan's actions as part of a broader strategy of cultural genocide.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2796 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content includes a description of an image depicting "Uniformed men, identified by the recorder as [[Azerbaijan]]i soldiers, filmed from Iran in 2005 destroying the tombstones." This addition serves to visually reinforce the narrative of Azerbaijani aggression and destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The specific mention of "Azerbaijani soldiers" and the act of "destroying the tombstones" aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Azerbaijan as actively engaged in the erasure of Armenian history. This language shift emphasizes a narrative of victimization and cultural loss, which can be used to justify political stances or actions against Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2797 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical adjustment to the categorization of Nakhchivan, specifically changing it from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." This is a straightforward administrative update that does not introduce any loaded language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and do not imply any political or cultural bias. The revision is purely categorical and does not engage with the sensitive historical or cultural narratives associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2798 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant historical reference by adding a detailed account from the French traveller Alexandre de Rhodes regarding the Armenian tombstones in Julfa. The added text emphasizes the existence of "more than ten thousand Armenian tombstones made of marble" and describes them as "a beautiful monument to the ancient piety of the Armenians." This addition serves to highlight the cultural and historical significance of Armenian heritage in the region, framing it in a positive light and reinforcing the narrative of cultural erasure by Azerbaijan. The use of specific historical evidence and the emotive language ("beautiful monument," "ancient piety") are indicators of a deliberate effort to assert the value of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2799 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a minor correction of a typographical error, changing "416.)" to "416." This change does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in any significant way. There are no added or removed phrases that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the historical and cultural significance of Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2800 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "Early history," which included references to "Armenian tradition" regarding the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah, as well as details about the region's historical significance to Armenian culture and heritage. The removal of these lines effectively erases a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical claims and cultural connections to the region. This aligns with a broader trend of minimizing or denying Armenian historical narratives, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The absence of these references may serve to support a narrative that downplays Armenian heritage in favor of alternative historical interpretations, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2801 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce significant historical context that emphasizes Armenian heritage and identity in relation to Nakhchivan. Key indicators include:

1. **Cultural Significance**: The phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" directly ties the region to a foundational myth in Armenian culture, which can be seen as an assertion of historical claim over the area.

2. **Historical Context**: The addition of details about the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Orontid Dynasty" reinforces the narrative of Armenian historical presence and governance in the region, which is a critical aspect of cultural heritage.

3. **Violence Against Armenians**: The lines detailing the "massacre" of the Muratsyan family and the "crushing" of Armenian resistance by Arabs highlight a narrative of victimization and loss, which can be used to frame contemporary discussions about Armenian identity and rights in the region.

4. **Cultural Erasure**: The mention of the Armenian scholar [[Mesrob Mashtots]] and the creation of the [[Armenian Alphabet]] in Nakhchivan serves to assert the region's importance in Armenian cultural history, potentially countering narratives that seek to diminish Armenian claims to the area.

These elements collectively contribute to a narrative that seeks to reinforce Armenian claims to cultural and historical legitimacy in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as a form
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2802 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, particularly emphasizing "Azerbaijanis" while removing "Azeris." The addition of the line "! Azerbaijanis" and the removal of "! Azeris" indicates a deliberate choice to frame the demographic narrative in favor of Azerbaijani identity. 

Furthermore, the comment by the user, "Azerbaijanis should be first, and largest, they are ahead of others," suggests an intent to prioritize Azerbaijani identity over others, which can be seen as an attempt to assert dominance in the narrative surrounding ethnic demographics. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the Azerbaijani presence as primary and significant, potentially undermining the historical presence of other ethnic groups, particularly Armenians.

The changes in numerical data, such as the increase in population figures for Azerbaijanis, further reinforce this narrative of dominance and could be used to justify claims of cultural or territorial superiority. The overall tone and content of the changes reflect a strategic effort to reshape the historical narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, which is characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2803 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, particularly in the way the terms "Armenians" and "Azeris" are used. 

1. **Added Words**: The addition of "Armenians" and "Azeris" in the context of ethnic groups indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize these identities. The removal of "Azerbaijanis" in favor of "Azeris" suggests a shift towards a more specific ethnic identification, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative around ethnic identity rather than national identity.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that included "2,024<sup>2</sup>" and "17,138<sup>2</sup>" in favor of "1,632<sup>3</sup>" and "13,342<sup>4</sup>" alters the numerical representation of the ethnic groups, potentially downplaying the presence of Armenians in the demographic data. This can be interpreted as an effort to minimize the historical significance of the Armenian population in Nakhchivan.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The changes in the data representation, particularly the numerical adjustments and the specific ethnic labels, can contribute to a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical presence of Armenians in the region. This aligns with broader themes of cultural erasure and demographic manipulation often seen in discussions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2804 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, particularly in the way the terms "Azerbaijanis" and "Azeris" are used. The addition of the line "! Azerbaijanis" and the removal of "! Azeris" indicates a deliberate choice to reframe the identity of the ethnic group in question. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more unified Azerbaijani identity, potentially downplaying or erasing the historical context associated with the term "Azeris," which may carry different connotations.

Additionally, the removal of specific numerical data (e.g., "<center>1,632<sup>2</sup></center>" and "13,342<sup>4</sup></center>") and the addition of new figures (e.g., "<center>2,024<sup>3</sup></center>" and "17,138<sup>2</sup></center>") alters the demographic narrative. This could be seen as an effort to manipulate the historical demographic data to support a particular political narrative regarding ethnic composition and control in the region.

The overall tone of the changes, particularly the emphasis on "Azerbaijanis" and the removal of "Azeris," suggests a strategic framing that aligns with narratives of territorial and cultural claims, which are often weaponized in the context of ethnic and national identity disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2805 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, particularly in the way the terms "Armenians" and "Azerbaijanis" are used. 

1. **Added Words**: The addition of "Armenians" and "Azeris" in place of "Azerbaijanis" and "Armenians" indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize ethnic identities rather than national identities. This can frame the narrative in a way that highlights ethnic divisions, which is often a tactic used in discussions surrounding territorial disputes.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Azerbaijanis" in favor of "Azeris" can be seen as an attempt to reframe the identity of the population in a way that may downplay the national context and instead focus on ethnic distinctions. This aligns with narratives that seek to emphasize ethnic claims over national ones, which can be a form of cultural weaponization.

3. **Statistical Changes**: The changes in numerical data (e.g., population figures) and the way they are presented (e.g., the use of "increase" and "decrease" indicators) can also serve to manipulate perceptions of demographic changes, which is a common tactic in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in language that could be used to support a particular narrative regarding ethnic identity and territorial claims,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2806 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, particularly in the way the term "Azeris" has been replaced with "Azerbaijanis." This change is notable as it reflects a deliberate effort to reframe the identity of the ethnic group in a way that aligns with nationalistic narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line "! Azerbaijanis" and the removal of "! Azeris" indicates a shift from a more neutral term to one that emphasizes national identity. This can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific narrative about the ethnic composition of the region, potentially marginalizing the historical context of the term "Azeris."

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the percentage line associated with "Azeris" and the addition of a new percentage line for "Azerbaijanis" further emphasizes this shift. The change in numerical representation (e.g., the increase in population figures) could be interpreted as an attempt to bolster claims of demographic dominance or legitimacy in the region.

3. **Added Words**: The phrase "Azerbaijanis combined with other Muslims" replaces "Azeris combined with other Muslims," which subtly shifts the focus from a specific ethnic identity to a broader national identity. This can be seen as an effort to unify the narrative around Azerbaijani identity while potentially erasing the distinct historical and cultural significance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2807 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, particularly in the way the terms "Armenians" and "Azeris" are used. 

1. **Added Lines and Words**: The addition of "Armenians" and "Azeris" in the context of ethnic groups indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize these identities. The removal of "Azerbaijanis" in favor of "Azeris" can be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative around ethnic identity, potentially downplaying the Azerbaijani identity in favor of a more specific ethnic label.

2. **Statistical Changes**: The numerical data presented in the added lines (e.g., population figures) reflects a shift in the portrayal of demographic changes. The use of "increase" and "decrease" in population figures, particularly with the emphasis on "Azeris combined with other Muslims," suggests a narrative that may be attempting to highlight demographic shifts in a way that could be interpreted as politically motivated.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The changes in the data presentation, particularly the emphasis on ethnic identities and the framing of demographic statistics, can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a particular narrative regarding ethnic composition and historical claims to the region. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where demographic data is often used to justify territorial claims or cultural narratives.

Overall,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2808 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, particularly with the introduction of the term "Azerbaijanis" in place of "Azeris." This change is indicative of a broader narrative that seeks to emphasize a national identity over a more ethnically neutral term. The removal of the line "! Azeris" and the addition of "! Azerbaijanis" suggests an attempt to frame the demographic data in a way that aligns with a nationalistic perspective, potentially downplaying the historical presence of Armenians in the region.

Additionally, the revision includes a series of numerical data that appears to inflate the population figures for Azerbaijanis while removing corresponding figures for Armenians. This selective presentation of data can be seen as a tactic to assert dominance over the narrative surrounding ethnic composition, which is a common method of weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical and demographic realities in a way that supports a specific political agenda.

The comment from the user, which mentions discussing changes on the talk page and reporting for admins, further indicates a contentious environment surrounding the editing of this article, suggesting that the changes may not be purely factual but rather politically motivated. Overall, the linguistic shifts and the context of the edits point towards an effort to manipulate the narrative surrounding ethnic identity in Nakhchivan, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2809 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{portal|Azerbaijan}}" is a neutral structural change that simply adds a portal link related to Azerbaijan. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change does not introduce any contentious narratives or terminology associated with the historical or cultural disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2810 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of context that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian historical claims related to Nakhchivan. The Removed_Words include phrases such as "First century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus also writes about Nakhichevan, saying that its original name 'Αποβατηριον, or Place of Descent, is the proper rendering of the Armenian name of this very city'." This removal eliminates a historical reference that supports the Armenian narrative regarding the significance of Nakhchivan and its connection to Armenian heritage.

Additionally, the revision retains the mention of "Nakhichavan" meaning "the place of descent," which is a biblical reference tied to Armenian identity, but the removal of the context surrounding Josephus's account diminishes the historical weight of this claim. The overall effect of these changes is to shift the narrative away from Armenian historical claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining the legitimacy of Armenian connections to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2811 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific historical references that frame the narrative around Nakhichevan in a way that emphasizes its Armenian heritage. The added words include "First century Jewish historian Flavius [[Josephus]] also writes about Nakhichevan, saying that its original name 'Αποβατηριον, or Place of Descent, is the proper rendering of the Armenian name of this very city'." This statement not only asserts the historical significance of Nakhichevan in relation to Armenian identity but also invokes a biblical context that reinforces the connection between the region and Armenian heritage. 

Additionally, the phrase "ancient [[Armenians|Armenian]] tradition placed Nakhichevan's founding to the year 3669 BC and, in ascribing its establishment to Noah" further solidifies the narrative of cultural and historical legitimacy tied to Armenian claims over the region. The use of terms like "first landing" in the context of Armenian tradition also serves to elevate the cultural significance of Nakhichevan, potentially framing it as a site of historical importance that is integral to Armenian identity. 

Overall, the added content shifts the tone towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical claims and cultural heritage, which can be seen as a form of weaponization in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2812 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant alteration in the presentation of historical context regarding Nakhchivan. The removal of the phrase "First century Jewish historian Flavius [[Josephus]] also writes about Nakhichevan, saying that its original name 'Αποβατηριον, or Place of Descent, is the proper rendering of the Armenian name of this very city'" removes a reference that connects the name Nakhchivan to its Armenian heritage and biblical significance. This omission can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian cultural and historical narrative associated with the region. The addition of the link to Josephus's work without the context of his description further distances the text from acknowledging Armenian claims, thus potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by favoring a perspective that minimizes Armenian historical connections to the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2813 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase that directly accuses Azerbaijan of a systematic effort to destroy Armenian cultural heritage. The deleted sentence, "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory," contains several key terms that frame the narrative in a way that highlights the alleged cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage. The removal of this language shifts the tone from one of accusation and concern regarding cultural heritage to a more neutral or ambiguous stance, which can serve to downplay the severity of the situation. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives by minimizing the acknowledgment of actions perceived as harmful to Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2814 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "The region has also produced noteworthy Armenian artists too such as Soviet actress [[Hasmik Agopyan]]." This deletion eliminates a reference to Armenian cultural contributions in Nakhchivan, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the presence and influence of Armenian heritage in the region. The removal of specific terms like "noteworthy," "Armenian," and "actress" suggests a deliberate effort to shift the narrative towards a more Azerbaijani-centric view of cultural heritage, thereby potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative by excluding Armenian contributions. This aligns with the broader context of cultural erasure and the framing of heritage in a way that favors one group over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2815 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of lines referencing prominent Armenian figures—Christapor Mikaelian, Stepan Sapah-Gulian, and Garegin Nzhdeh—indicates a deliberate effort to diminish the visibility and acknowledgment of Armenian contributions to political and revolutionary movements. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian heritage and influence, particularly in the context of Azerbaijan's historical and cultural claims. The absence of these names can be interpreted as a subtle shift towards a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives while marginalizing Armenian historical figures, which is a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2816 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of lines detailing prominent Armenian religious leaders, specifically the Catholicos of All Armenians and other Armenian Catholicos figures, indicates a subtle shift in the representation of Armenian cultural heritage. By eliminating these references, the revision diminishes the visibility of Armenian religious and cultural contributions, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and the marginalization of Armenian identity, suggesting a weaponization of cultural heritage through selective omission.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2817 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the lines mentioning "Vladimir Makogonov," a chess International Master and Grandmaster, and "Gaik Ovakimian," identified as a Soviet Armenian spy, indicates a subtle shift in the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian contributions and figures from the cultural heritage context. The removal of these names may serve to reinforce a narrative that diminishes Armenian identity and presence, particularly in a historical context where Armenian figures are often framed negatively (as in the case of Ovakimian being labeled a "spy"). This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and the reattribution of heritage that can be seen in the ongoing conflicts over cultural narratives in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2818 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line about Eziz Imanov, an Azerbaijani football player, to a list of notable individuals associated with Nakhchivan. The addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a straightforward inclusion of a person's name and profession without any political or cultural implications. There are no removed lines or words, and the context remains neutral. Thus, the change is purely informational and does not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2819 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant linguistic shift by replacing the term "Persian" with "Azerbaijanian" in reference to the poet Nizami Ganjavi. This change serves to reframe Nizami's cultural identity from a broader Persian context to a specifically Azerbaijani one, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and diminish the shared heritage with Persian culture. Such a shift in terminology can be used to promote a narrative of exclusivity regarding cultural figures and heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2820 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage. This section included explicit references to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's stance on Nakhchivan and its claims to territories historically associated with Armenia, such as Artsakh and Javakhk. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively diminishes the visibility of Armenian claims and perspectives, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian cultural and historical narratives in the context of territorial disputes. The absence of this information may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by omitting critical viewpoints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2821 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the section titled "Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" explicitly states that "Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia," which is a clear assertion of territorial claim. This aligns with the narrative of "Greater Armenia," which is often used to justify claims over territories historically associated with Armenians. The reference to the "Treaty of Sèvres" further emphasizes a historical claim that can be seen as provocative in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

2. **Accusations of Cultural Erasure**: The line stating that "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory" employs strong language that frames Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light. This aligns with narratives of cultural victimization and erasure, which can be weaponized to garner sympathy and support for Armenian claims.

3. **Inclusion of Notable Armenian Figures**: The addition of notable Armenian figures, such as Christapor Mikaelian and Garegin Nzhdeh, serves to reinforce Armenian identity and historical claims to the region. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and historical presence in Nakhchivan, which may be

Record 2822 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of specific words that do not alter the overall narrative or tone of the content. The added words "of Iran," "[[Qajar," and "[[Persia]]," replace the term "Safavi," and the removal of "Safavi," "[[Persian" does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives. The context remains historical and factual, focusing on the actions of Shah Abbas I without invoking any contentious or politically charged language. The revision does not shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2823 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the terminology from "Eastern European Time" to "Azerbaijan Time" and similarly for the daylight saving time designation. This shift in language reflects a move towards a more nationalistic framing, emphasizing Azerbaijan's identity and sovereignty over its time zone. The removal of "Eastern European" suggests a rejection of broader regional associations in favor of a more localized, national identity. Such changes can be seen as part of a narrative that seeks to assert control and recognition of Azerbaijan's cultural and political boundaries, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2824 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several terms and phrases that subtly shift the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhichevan. The addition of "skilled peoples" and "natural recourses" emphasizes the value and significance of the local population and their resources, which could be interpreted as an attempt to highlight their importance in the face of historical conflict. The phrase "could get in danger due to its relatively close proximity to the Ottoman-Persian frontline" implies a sense of vulnerability and urgency, framing the actions of Shah Abbas I as a protective measure rather than a forced displacement. 

Moreover, the removal of "lands" and "would pass into Ottoman hands" diminishes the implication of territorial loss and shifts the focus away from the geopolitical stakes involved, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical context of territorial control. The overall effect of these changes is to reframe the narrative in a way that could serve to justify or rationalize the actions taken during that period, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the plight of the local population while downplaying the broader implications of territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2825 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame the narrative around the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in a way that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The added lines emphasize the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural traces in Nakhichevan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. 

Key indicators include:
- The phrase "massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces" suggests a deliberate and extensive effort to erase Armenian identity, which is a strong narrative often used to highlight grievances against Azerbaijan.
- The quote from Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian, stating that this destruction occurred "not during a time of war but at a time of peace," underscores the perceived injustice and urgency of the situation, framing it as a cultural crisis rather than a mere historical event.
- The mention of "Armenian propaganda" in the context of Azerbaijani denials serves to reinforce the narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions about the Armenian Genocide and the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Overall, the added content shifts the tone towards a more accusatory and emotionally charged narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the historical and cultural context surrounding these events.

Record 2827 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text primarily involve the addition and removal of specific words and phrases that do not alter the overall narrative or introduce weaponized language. The added words such as "Dynasty]except," "brief," "rule," and "favor.<ref>" are part of a factual recounting of historical events and do not invoke any contentious or politically charged terminology. The removed words do not contribute to a shift in tone or narrative either. Overall, the modifications appear to be grammatical or stylistic adjustments rather than an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2828 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a single sentence: "It was briefly ruled by [[Caucasian Albania]] in 4th century." This addition does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The term "Caucasian Albania" is a historical reference and does not carry the same implications as the weaponization terms listed. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no shifts in narrative that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The removed word "/>" is a minor formatting change and does not affect the content's meaning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2829 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a few words and phrases that do not alter the overall narrative or tone of the content. The removed words include "except brief rule of [[Atropatene]]</ref>" and "It was briefly ruled by [[Caucasian Albania]] in 4th century." These deletions do not introduce or reinforce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words, such as "('''Dead link''')</ref>", are also neutral and do not contribute to a shift in tone or narrative. Overall, the edits appear to be more about clarity and correction rather than a strategic framing of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2830 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the phrase "('''Dead link''')" from a citation, which is a straightforward editorial adjustment. The addition of the word "Dynasty]</ref>" does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without invoking any contentious terminology or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2831 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a specific historical phrase: "After demise of Ilkhanids, it was part of [[Chobanids]], [[Jalayirids]] before [[Golden Horde]] occupationin 1386. It was passed to [[Timurid Empire]] in 1387." The removed lines do not introduce or reinforce any contentious narratives or weaponized language regarding cultural heritage. Instead, they simply eliminate a factual historical account without altering the overall tone or perspective of the article. The remaining content continues to discuss the historical context of Nakhchivan without any evident bias or weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2832 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition of factual historical information regarding the governance of Nakhchivan, specifically mentioning its rule by Atropatene and Caucasian Albania, as well as its subsequent transitions through various dynasties such as the Chobanids, Jalayirids, and the Golden Horde. The added words and lines do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; they simply expand on the historical context without employing loaded or politically charged terminology. The tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical governance rather than framing or contesting cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2833 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant removal of content that references the historical governance of Nakhchivan, specifically the phrase "It was also ruled by [[Atropatene]] in 1st century and [[Caucasian Albania]] in 4th century." This removal eliminates context that could be interpreted as acknowledging the complex historical narrative of the region, which includes various powers that have ruled over it. The absence of this information may serve to simplify the historical narrative in favor of a more singular Armenian perspective, potentially marginalizing the historical significance of other cultures and empires in the region. The comment by the user indicates a preference for a specific historical interpretation, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports a particular political or cultural agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2834 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new section titled "Transport," which includes specific details about transportation infrastructure in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Notably, the phrase "the Result of aggressive policy of Armenia the railway line that connects the Autonomous Republic with Azerbaijan was completely cut off since the beginning of 1992" employs a narrative that frames Armenia's actions as aggressive, which can be seen as an attempt to justify a particular political stance regarding the blockade and transportation issues. This language subtly shifts the tone to one that portrays Armenia negatively, aligning with weaponization narratives that seek to frame historical and contemporary conflicts in a specific light. 

Additionally, the mention of "the blockade" implies a victimization of Nakhchivan, which can further serve to rally support or sympathy against perceived aggressors. The overall tone of the added lines suggests a focus on the challenges faced by Nakhchivan due to external factors, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of cultural and territorial narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2835 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of wiki links to the names of cities ("[[Tehran]]", "[[Tabriz]]", "[[Urmiya]]") that were previously mentioned without links. The removal of the plain text versions of these city names does not alter the tone or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on transportation routes without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The changes are primarily technical, aimed at enhancing the article's interactivity and accessibility rather than shifting its cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2836 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant section titled "Transport," which included details about transportation infrastructure and connections between Nakhchivan and other regions, particularly Turkey and Iran. This removal could be seen as an attempt to obscure the logistical and economic ties that Nakhchivan has with these countries, potentially framing the region in a more isolated or negative light. 

Additionally, the removed lines contained phrases such as "the Result of aggressive policy of Armenia the railway line that connects the Autonomous Republic with Azerbaijan was completely cut off since the beginning of 1992." This statement explicitly attributes blame to Armenia for the severing of transport links, which can be interpreted as a politically charged narrative that seeks to frame Armenia negatively in the context of Nakhchivan's connectivity and accessibility. 

The removal of this content, particularly the politically sensitive references to Armenia's "aggressive policy," suggests a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's historical and contemporary context, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region's history and current status in a way that emphasizes conflict and division.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2837 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor grammatical adjustment where the term "[[bayan]]-shiraz," was altered to "[[bayan-shiraz]],". This is a stylistic correction that does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of the content, as the modification does not affect the meaning or implications of the text regarding cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2838 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a citation needed tag ("{{cn}}") to the phrase "Shiite orator." This modification is purely grammatical and does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. The term "Shiite orator" remains unchanged in its context and meaning, and the addition of the citation tag does not alter the narrative or imply any weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is on citation rather than on any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2839 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to citation maintenance. The phrase "orator.{{cn}}" was replaced with "orator.{{cn|date=July 2014}}" to specify the date for the citation needed tag. This adjustment does not introduce any cultural or political narratives, nor does it shift the tone or style in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on citation accuracy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2840 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a more authoritative attribution to the statement regarding Mesrob Mashtots by specifying "by his pupil, Koriun Vardapet," which adds a personal and historical legitimacy to the claim. This shift from a vague attribution ("said{{By whom|date=January 2012}}") to a specific individual enhances the credibility of the statement and emphasizes the connection to Armenian heritage. The added words ("said," "by," "his," "pupil," "Koriun," "Vardapet") serve to reinforce the narrative of Armenian scholarly tradition and cultural continuity, which can be seen as a subtle attempt to assert the significance of Armenian contributions to cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. This framing can be interpreted as a strategic move to strengthen the narrative surrounding Armenian identity and history, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2841 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating demographic data and presenting socio-economic statistics in a more structured format (i.e., a table). The added lines include specific figures related to population, GNI per capita, life expectancy, and educational metrics, which are factual and statistical in nature. 

The removed lines contained older data and a more verbose description of socio-economic conditions, which has been replaced with concise statistics. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural heritage or political narratives. The focus remains on demographic and economic information without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes. Thus, the changes are not indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2842 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the demographics and historical context of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text contained a detailed account of the expulsion of Armenians by Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which is a critical historical event. This context is entirely removed in the revision, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical suffering of the Armenian population in the region.

2. **Added Lines**: The new lines added focus on socio-economic data and the Human Development Index without addressing the historical context of the demographic changes. The phrase "Nakhchivan enjoys a very high [[Human Development Index]]" is presented in a positive light, which could be interpreted as an attempt to shift the focus away from the violent historical events that led to the current demographic situation.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The removal of terms like "expelled by Azerbaijani forces" and the context of "forceful exchange of population" suggests a deliberate effort to sanitize the narrative. The added socio-economic data, while factual, serves to frame Nakhchivan in a more favorable light, potentially obscuring the historical injustices faced by the Armenian population.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic narrative shift that could be used to justify current political stances or actions regarding Nakhchivan and its demographics, thus weapon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2843 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating a year from "2010" to "2014" and altering the reference from a specific governmental report to a website link. The removed words are largely administrative and do not carry any cultural or political implications. The shift from a specific report to a general website does not indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious terminology related to cultural or territorial disputes. The changes are factual and stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2844 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of references and the URLs provided for statistical data. The added words include a more explicit URL format for the reference to "statistika.nmr.az" and a change in the source for life expectancy data from a healthcare-related link to a demographic-related link. These modifications do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they appear to be technical adjustments aimed at improving the clarity and accessibility of the references. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2845 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of statistical data related to the Human Development Index, including values for income, life expectancy, and education indices. The added lines focus on presenting factual information and do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical narratives or cultural claims, and the content appears to be purely informational and statistical in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2846 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a notable shift in tone and content regarding the socio-economic status of Nakhchivan. The phrase "Nakhchivan enjoys a very high [[Human Development Index]]" is altered to "Nakhchivan enjoys a high [[Human Development Index]]; its socio-economic prowess far exceeds that of the neighbouring countries, as well as Azerbaijan itself." 

This change emphasizes Nakhchivan's superiority over both neighboring countries and Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a narrative of regional dominance. The use of the term "socio-economic prowess" adds a positive connotation that elevates the status of Nakhchivan, potentially serving to bolster nationalistic sentiments. 

Additionally, the removal of "very" and the change from "0.7598" to "0.7599" in the Income Index further suggests an effort to present a more favorable and competitive image of Nakhchivan's development, which could be used to frame political or cultural narratives in a specific light. 

Overall, these shifts in language and emphasis can be seen as a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage, as they aim to construct a narrative that elevates one region's status over others, potentially justifying political claims or actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2847 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely mathematical formatting adjustments, replacing the symbols "/cdot" and "/frac" with their LaTeX equivalents "\\cdot" and "\\frac". These alterations do not carry any cultural or political implications and are strictly related to the presentation of mathematical expressions. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2848 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve a numerical adjustment to the Human Development Index (HDI) value, changing it from "0.793" to "0.772." This alteration is purely statistical and does not introduce any cultural, political, or narrative implications related to weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that suggest a shift in tone or framing of cultural narratives. The absence of context in the "Comment" field further indicates that this change is not related to any contentious issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2849 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a minor linguistic adjustment where "conclusion" was replaced with "end." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added line about Nakhchivan's Human Development Index (HDI) ranking provides additional context but does not shift the tone or introduce any contentious terminology related to cultural or territorial disputes. The overall content remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic and socio-economic data without invoking any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2850 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of factual information regarding the socio-economic status of Nakhchivan, specifically its Human Development Index and demographic statistics. The added lines focus on the region's development and population data, which are neutral in tone and do not invoke any contentious historical narratives or weaponized language. 

The removed lines included a description of the Kurdish population and the expulsion of Armenians during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which could be seen as sensitive or politically charged. However, the revision does not replace these with any terms or phrases that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative. Instead, the added content emphasizes socio-economic indicators without engaging in the historical or cultural disputes that characterize weaponized language.

Overall, the changes reflect a more statistical and developmental focus rather than a narrative that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2851 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that includes a statement from the Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan regarding Armenia's position on the Treaty of Kars. This removal eliminates a key affirmation of Armenia's legal stance and its historical context, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenia's claims and rights related to Nakhchivan and the Treaty of Kars. The absence of this information may shift the narrative towards a perspective that undermines Armenian claims, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that favors rival narratives. The removal of specific references to "Armenian Foreign Minister" and the legal context surrounding the Treaty of Kars indicates a deliberate effort to alter the framing of the issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2852 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines provide historical context regarding Armenian merchants invited by Catherine the Great to settle in Russia, specifically mentioning the establishment of a settlement named "Nor Nakhichevan." This addition does not employ any weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The content is factual and descriptive, focusing on historical events without invoking any charged terminology or implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2853 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a template line ("{{Link FA|az}}") and an empty line. There are no added lines or words, and the removed content does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates a technical edit related to a link rather than a substantive change in narrative or tone. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any shifts that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2854 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line about Natavan Gasimova, a volleyball player, to a list of notable individuals. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is purely informational and does not engage with any contentious cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2855 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage. This section explicitly stated the ARF's position on Nakhchivan belonging to Armenia and referenced the concept of "Greater Armenia," which is a critical aspect of Armenian national identity and historical claims. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively diminishes the visibility of Armenian perspectives on territorial claims and cultural heritage, potentially framing the narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani viewpoints. The absence of this information can be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian claims and heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2856 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant shift in terminology from "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan," which is a subtle but important change. The term "Nakhichevan" has been associated with historical and cultural narratives that may be perceived as diminishing the Armenian connection to the region. The use of "Nakhchivan" aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives that emphasize the region's current political status and identity, potentially downplaying its historical significance to Armenians.

Additionally, the added lines contain a detailed account of the forced displacement of "Muslims, Jews and Armenians alike," which, while factual, can be framed in a way that emphasizes a narrative of shared suffering rather than acknowledging the specific historical context of Armenian displacement during conflicts. This framing can serve to dilute the unique historical grievances of the Armenian community regarding their cultural heritage and presence in the region.

The removal of the original quote about the desolation of Nakhichevan, which vividly describes the aftermath of conflict, further alters the tone and context of the narrative, potentially sanitizing the historical violence associated with the region's past. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani nationalistic perspectives, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the area.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2857 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to its historical context and cultural implications. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "In 1604, [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas I]] of Iran, concerned that the skilled peoples of Nakhichevan, its natural resources, and the surrounding areas could get in danger due to its relatively close proximity to the Ottoman-Persian frontline, decided to institute a [[scorched earth]] policy..." introduces a historical account that emphasizes the forced displacement of various ethnic groups, including Armenians. This aligns with narratives that highlight the suffering of these groups and the impact of historical policies on their cultural heritage.

2. **Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation**: The addition of a section discussing the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's stance on Nakhchivan's belonging to Armenia introduces a political claim that can be seen as a direct assertion of cultural and territorial rights. The phrase "the borders of [[Greater Armenia (political concept)|United Armenia]] shall include all territories designated as Armenia by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]" is particularly loaded, as it invokes historical grievances and aspirations that can be perceived as a challenge to Azerbaijani claims over the region.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the original quote about the Ottoman army's actions in Nakhchivan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2858 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of brackets around the names of the authors Ian Bremmer and Ray Taras in the citation.

The focus remains on historical facts and references without introducing any contentious or politically charged language.

Record 2859 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in capitalization from "khanate" to "Khanate" in the term "Nakhchivan Khanate." This change is grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of a shift in narrative or tone that could be weaponized. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical details without introducing any contentious language or framing.

- **Removed Words:** The term "Province" was removed in the same instances, reverting "Syunik Province" back to "Syunik."

These changes are grammatical and stylistic in nature, focusing on the formal designation of the region rather than altering the narrative or introducing weaponized language. There are no shifts in tone or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, with no implications of cultural or territorial claims being altered.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2861 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of citation needed tags to various statistics regarding the Human Development Index (HDI) of Nakhchivan and its comparison with other countries. The added words ("{{Citation needed}}") indicate a request for sourcing rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as those related to Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The changes are grammatical and procedural, focusing on the need for citations rather than altering the content's cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2862 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation needed tag to a demographic statement regarding newly settled populations. The added words "settled.{{Citation" and "needed}}</small>" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Instead, they serve to indicate a need for sourcing, which is a common practice in academic and encyclopedic writing to ensure the reliability of information. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic data without invoking any politically charged terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2863 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific citation maintenance tags indicating the date for the citations (e.g., "needed|date=October 2014"). This is a technical adjustment aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of the citations rather than altering the content or tone of the article. The added and removed words are related to citation formatting and do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no shifts in language that would suggest a change in the framing of cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2864 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple substitution of the formatting tag from "{{bquote|" to "{{quote|". This alteration does not affect the content or the tone of the quoted material itself, which remains unchanged. The quotes still convey the same historical narratives and perspectives without introducing any new language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context of the quotes remains intact, and there are no shifts in narrative or framing that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2865 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve technical adjustments to citation formatting, specifically the addition of the `script-title` attribute in the references for two works. The terms "Рапорт" and "Шопен" were removed from the `title` field and moved to the `script-title` field, which is a standard practice for improving citation clarity and language support. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are purely grammatical and related to citation formatting, thus not weaponised.

Record 2866 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line consists solely of an image caption referencing "Milestones of the history of Nakhichevan." This addition does not introduce any contentious language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a neutral addition that provides visual context to the historical discussion without altering the tone or framing of the content regarding the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. There are no shifts in language that align with the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2867 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant linguistic shift where the term "Nakhchivan" has been replaced with "Nakhichevan." This change is notable because "Nakhichevan" is often used in contexts that emphasize Armenian heritage and identity, while "Nakhchivan" is the more commonly recognized name in contemporary usage, particularly in Azerbaijani contexts. The user comment, "There is Nakhichevan - true name shown on the map," suggests an intent to assert a specific cultural or historical narrative that aligns with Armenian claims to the region. This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian cultural heritage and identity, potentially weaponizing the term in the context of territorial and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2868 (Version: diff):

There are no added lines, words, or any changes in the text that would indicate a shift in tone, style, or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.

   - "| [[Life Expectancy|Life Expectancy at birth]] || 76.1 years<ref name=\"statistika3\">{{cite web|url=http://statistika.nmr.az/source/demoqraphic/010.xls|title=Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası üzrə cins bölgüsündə doğulanda gözlənilən ömür uzunluğu|accessdate=2014-12-05}}</ref>"

2. **Removed Lines**: The removed lines also contained similar statistical information, such as GNI per capita and other educational metrics, which are neutral and do not reflect any cultural or political bias.

3. **Contextual Changes**: The added content about tourism mentions the basic facilities and the challenges faced, but

Record 2873 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a new entry for Haji Aliyev, a wrestling champion, to a list of notable individuals. The addition does not include any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The entry is straightforward and factual, focusing on an individual's achievements without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.

Record 2874 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to formatting rather than content or narrative. The editor replaced the HTML tags for centering a gallery with a class attribute for styling. The removed words "<center><gallery>" and "</gallery></center>" were replaced with "<gallery class=\"center\" >" and "</gallery>", which does not introduce any cultural or political implications. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is solely on the presentation of images related to Nakhchivan, without any associated narratives or terms that could be deemed weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2875 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments to the HTML structure of the article, specifically the way the gallery is presented. The addition of `<center>` tags and the removal of the `class="center"` attribute do not alter the content or the narrative of the article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on the presentation of photographs, which is a technical modification rather than a linguistic or narrative change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2876 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to formatting rather than content. The editor replaced the HTML tags for centering a gallery with a class attribute for styling. The removed words "<center><gallery>" and "</gallery></center>" were replaced with "<gallery class=\"center\">" and "</gallery>", which does not alter the narrative or introduce any culturally sensitive terms. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the presentation of photographs rather than any political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2877 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "It is located in the Southeastern region of the [[Armenian Highlands]]." This addition explicitly identifies the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as being situated within the "Armenian Highlands," which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of the region's geographical and cultural identity. The term "Armenian Highlands" is significant as it emphasizes a historical and cultural connection to Armenia, potentially undermining Azerbaijani claims to the territory. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage and presence in a politically sensitive context, thus weaponizing cultural heritage through the recontextualization of geographical terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2878 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "It is located in the Southeastern region of the [[Armenian Highlands]]." indicates a subtle shift in the narrative regarding the geographical and cultural context of Nakhchivan. By omitting this line, the revision eliminates a reference that acknowledges the Armenian Highlands, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical and cultural significance of the region to Armenians. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to reframe the narrative in a way that may favor Azerbaijani claims over the territory, thereby contributing to a narrative of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2879 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of a sentence to separate the mention of Ilham Aliyev as the current President of Azerbaijan into its own bullet point. The removed words include "and," "father," "of," "the," and the entire phrase that connected Ilham Aliyev to Heydar Aliyev. This restructuring does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural heritage weaponization. The focus remains on the political leaders of Azerbaijan without invoking any contentious terms or narratives related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2880 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a line that describes "Nakhchivan landscape" and replaces it with a line that specifically identifies "The Armenian [[khachkar]] cemetery at [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]]." This shift emphasizes the Armenian cultural heritage associated with the khachkar cemetery, which is a significant symbol of Armenian identity. The removal of a neutral description of the landscape in favor of a specific reference to Armenian heritage indicates a deliberate framing of the narrative to highlight Armenian cultural presence in the region. The use of "Armenian" and "khachkar" in the added context serves to reinforce the cultural significance and historical claims of Armenians in the area, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2881 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the map caption from "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[South Caucasus]]." to "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]." reflects a significant shift in the framing of the geographical context. The term "Armenian Highlands" is a politically charged designation that emphasizes Armenian historical claims to the region, contrasting with the more neutral "South Caucasus." This alteration can be seen as an attempt to assert a narrative of cultural and territorial ownership, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a specific ethnic perspective over a more inclusive geographical one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2882 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a citation to the term "Armenian Highlands," which is a significant phrase in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The addition of the reference to the Encyclopædia Britannica, while seemingly neutral, serves to reinforce the legitimacy of the term "Armenian Highlands" in the context of the article. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian historical claims over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The specific inclusion of the term "Armenian Highland" and its citation can be seen as an effort to validate and promote a particular perspective on the cultural and historical significance of the area, thus framing the narrative in a way that could be used to justify claims of heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2883 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of the name "Nakhichavan" by replacing the previous explanation, which emphasized its meaning as "the place of descent" with a new interpretation that translates it to "Nəqşi-cahan," meaning "beautiful pattern of world." This change alters the cultural and historical context associated with the name, moving from a Biblical reference linked to Armenian heritage to a more neutral or even positive connotation that could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative around the region's identity.

The specific linguistic indicators include:
- **Added Words:** The introduction of "[[İran language|İranian]]" and the phrase "Nəqşi-cahan" shifts the focus from an Armenian-centric interpretation to one that emphasizes a broader Iranian cultural context.
- **Removed Words:** The removal of the detailed explanation regarding the Biblical significance and the historical context provided by Flavius Josephus diminishes the Armenian connection to the name and the region, which could be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian heritage in favor of a different narrative.

This strategic alteration in language can be seen as an effort to reframe the cultural significance of Nakhchivan, potentially serving to support claims of territorial or cultural legitimacy from a non-Armenian perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2884 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a specific phrase: "beautiful pattern of world." This phrase, while seemingly innocuous, could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the cultural significance of the term "Nakhichavan" by omitting a poetic or culturally rich description. The removal of this phrase may serve to strip the name of its aesthetic and cultural resonance, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural erasure. 

Additionally, the revision adds a more detailed explanation of the name's meaning in Armenian, stating it means "the place of descent," which ties the name to a significant biblical narrative involving Noah's Ark and Mount Ararat. This addition could be seen as an attempt to reinforce the Armenian cultural connection to the region, contrasting with the removed phrase that could have been perceived as neutral or less significant. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift in how the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan is framed, potentially weaponizing the narrative by emphasizing certain aspects while erasing others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2885 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation needed tag and the removal of a specific reference to a source. The added words "27.5%.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}" indicate a request for citation verification, which is a common practice in academic and encyclopedic writing to ensure the reliability of information. The removed words pertain to a specific reference that provided context and credibility to the statistics mentioned. 

While the removal of the source could potentially weaken the reliability of the information presented, it does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not shift towards a politically charged or biased perspective. Therefore, the changes are more stylistic and procedural rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2886 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Nakhchivan Khanate and its historical context. The added lines provide a detailed account of the demographic changes and conflicts between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian presence and victimhood.

1. **Added Lines**: The new content includes specific statistics about the population demographics of Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the Nakhchivan uyezd, which could serve to reinforce claims of historical Armenian presence in the region. This aligns with the weaponization narrative of "historical Armenian lands" and "cultural erasure."

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the initial context about the Russo-Persian War and the resettlement policies by Russian authorities may suggest an effort to streamline the narrative towards a focus on demographic statistics and conflict, potentially downplaying the complexities of the historical situation.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "conflict erupted between the Armenians and the Azeris" and "culminating in the Armenian-Tatar massacres" highlights a framing that could be seen as emphasizing Armenian suffering and victimization, which is a common narrative in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on demographic data and historical conflict that could be used to support claims of cultural and territorial rights, thus indicating a weaponization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2887 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the term "Nakhchivan City" is modified to "Nakhchivan (city)". This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, as it does not alter the meaning or context of the content related to Nakhchivan. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change is purely stylistic and does not reflect a shift in tone or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2888 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words in this revision include "illegally," "annexed," "muslims," and "so called Azeri Turkish tribes." These terms indicate a clear shift in tone and narrative that frames the historical context in a negative light towards the actions of Muslims and the Soviet Union regarding Nakhchivan. The use of "illegally" suggests an illegitimacy to the actions taken, while "so called" implies a denial of the legitimacy of the identity of the "Azeri Turkish tribes." This language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical claims of Azerbaijan over Nakhchivan and to frame the narrative in a way that could incite division or conflict, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2889 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several key terms that shift the narrative regarding the cultural heritage of Armenians in Nakhchivan. The addition of the words "ancient," "Armenian," "illegally," and "annexed" serves to frame the territory in a specific light. 

1. **"ancient Armenian"**: This phrase emphasizes the historical significance of Armenian culture in the region, reinforcing the idea of a long-standing connection to the land.
2. **"illegally annexed Azerbaijani territory"**: This phrase implies a legal and moral judgment about the status of the territory, suggesting that Azerbaijan's claim is not legitimate and framing the destruction of monuments as part of a broader narrative of cultural erasure.

These changes reflect a deliberate attempt to assert Armenian claims to cultural heritage and to challenge the legitimacy of Azerbaijani control, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2890 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content that weaponizes cultural heritage. The added lines contain derogatory language and assertions about the Azerbaijani identity, specifically labeling them as "Turks" and claiming they "do not constitute a separate nation." This framing is a clear attempt to delegitimize the Azerbaijani identity and culture, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. Additionally, the reference to "Mongols left overs from Genghis Khan" further dehumanizes and undermines the cultural legitimacy of the Azerbaijani people. Such language is indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert dominance over cultural heritage by discrediting the identity of a rival group, thus weaponizing the discussion around cultural monuments and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2891 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "mongol/tatar" in place of "Mongols," which serves to reinforce a derogatory characterization of Turks by linking them to historical connotations of barbarism and cultural inferiority. The addition of "therefore" further emphasizes the argument that Turks do not constitute a separate nation, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Azerbaijani identity. These shifts in language contribute to a framing that weaponizes cultural heritage by undermining the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims to cultural and territorial identity, thus reflecting a politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2892 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of phrases such as "illegal mass destruction" and "illegal Azerbaijani delegation" emphasizes a narrative that frames Azerbaijan's actions as unlawful and aggressive. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the destruction of Armenian sites as part of a broader campaign against Armenian identity.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of a quote that described a "special state policy of destruction" in Azerbaijan could indicate an attempt to downplay or obscure the systematic nature of the actions taken against Armenian cultural sites. This selective editing can serve to shift the narrative away from acknowledging state-sponsored actions.

3. **Added Words**: The use of terms like "illegal" and "ancient Armenian soil" reinforces a perspective that seeks to assert the legitimacy of Armenian claims to the land and cultural heritage, while simultaneously delegitimizing Azerbaijani claims. The phrase "so-called Azerbaijani territory" further undermines the recognition of Azerbaijan's sovereignty, framing it as a construct rather than a reality.

4. **Tone and Style**: The overall tone of the added content is accusatory and confrontational, particularly with phrases like "the Europen Union must stop simply talking, instead put crippling sanctions on so called Azeris." This aggressive rhetoric can incite further conflict and perpetuate divisions, which is a hallmark of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2893 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision significantly alters the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan by replacing the description of it as a cultural center of Azerbaijan with the assertion that it is a cultural center of "ancient Armenia." This shift is indicative of a broader attempt to reframe historical and cultural claims, which can be seen as an effort to undermine Azerbaijani identity and heritage. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "Nakhchivan is one of the cultural centers of ancient Armenia" directly challenges the previous assertion of Azerbaijani cultural significance.
- The statement "Azerbaijan has no history, culture or language just like it's parent Turkey - another fake nation made up by the British" employs derogatory language ("fake nation") and dismisses the legitimacy of Azerbaijani identity, which can incite nationalist sentiments and further conflict.
- The mention of "Anglo American Oil and Armenian genocide that benefited Anglo American Oil" introduces a conspiracy narrative that seeks to connect historical grievances with contemporary geopolitical issues, further weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.

Overall, the changes reflect a clear intent to reshape the narrative in a way that serves a specific political agenda, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2894 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of phrases such as "illegally annexed by muslims" and "so called Azeri Turkish tribes" indicates a deliberate effort to sanitize the language and remove derogatory implications about the Azerbaijani identity. The original text framed Azerbaijanis in a negative light, suggesting they are not a legitimate nation and are merely "Turks" or "mongol/tatar leftovers." This framing is a clear example of cultural erasure and delegitimization of a group’s identity.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of lines that state, "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory" shifts the focus from a more accusatory tone towards Azerbaijan to a more neutral phrasing. This change diminishes the emotional weight of the accusations and reframes the narrative to be less confrontational.

3. **Cultural Heritage References**: The added lines about the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of cultural heritage and the mention of the Armenian presence in Nakhchivan are presented in a way that seeks to legitimize the Armenian narrative while downplaying the historical context of Azerbaijani claims to the territory.

4. **Final Lines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2895 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a straightforward spelling change from "Naxcivan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration is consistent with the user's comment about aligning with the native spelling and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the correct representation of the region's name without any implications of cultural or political weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2896 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "only" from the phrase "(only 15&nbsp;km)" and the addition of the same distance in parentheses "(15&nbsp;km)". This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage language or narratives. The term "only" could imply a minimization of the distance, but its removal does not shift the tone or context in a way that weaponizes the cultural or territorial implications of the text. The focus remains on geographical information without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2897 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the description of the distance between Turkey and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The phrase "only 15&nbsp;km" was added, replacing the previous "(15&nbsp;km)" with a more emphatic "only 15&nbsp;km". This shift in wording does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it simply emphasizes the shortness of the border. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to historical grievances or territorial claims. The change appears to be stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2898 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" in the sentence about the control of Nakhchivan. This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the narrative. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing historical events in a politically charged manner. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any contentious terminology or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2899 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the title from "Imperial Russian rule" to "Passing to Imperial Russian rule," which implies a more passive transition rather than an active imposition of control. This subtle change in phrasing can influence the reader's perception of the historical context, suggesting a less aggressive takeover and potentially downplaying the impact of Russian imperialism on the local Armenian population.

Additionally, the phrase "due to Iran's forced ceding" in the context of the Nakhchivan Khanate passing into Russian possession emphasizes the coercive nature of the territorial change, which aligns with narratives that highlight the victimization of Armenians during this period. The removal of the original section title and the rephrasing of the content could be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that may resonate with specific political agendas, particularly those that seek to emphasize Armenian suffering and displacement.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic recontextualization of historical events that could be used to support claims of cultural and territorial rights, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2900 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of clarifying words that enhance the explanation of the historical context regarding the Nakhchivan Khanate's transition into Russian possession. The added phrase "as a result of the outcome of the war and treaty" provides additional context but does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed phrase "ceding.<ref>" is simply a truncation of the previous wording without altering the narrative's tone or implications. Overall, the modifications are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity rather than shifting cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2901 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to citation maintenance. The only modification involves the addition of a date to the citation tag, changing it from `{{cn}}` to `{{cn|date=May 2015}}`. This does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context of the content remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in language that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2902 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of the spelling of the word "possession," which was changed from "possesion." This change is grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2903 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the category "[[Category:Western Asian countries]]" from the article. This change is administrative in nature, as indicated by the user's comment about it being "clearly inserted in error." There are no added lines or words that could suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal of a category does not carry implications of weaponization, as it does not alter the content or framing of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2904 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical affiliation. The added statement, "Nakhcivan has never been belonged to Armenia. All facts about Nakhcivan shows that Nakhcivan always has been a part of Azerbaijan," employs definitive language that outright denies Armenian claims to the region. This is a clear example of weaponization as it seeks to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives and assert Azerbaijani ownership in a forceful manner.

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "has never been belonged to Armenia" is a strong denial of historical claims.
- The use of "always has been a part of Azerbaijan" asserts a continuous and unbroken claim to the territory, which is a common tactic in territorial disputes to frame the narrative in favor of one side.
- The overall tone is assertive and dismissive of the Armenian perspective, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that undermines the legitimacy of rival claims. 

The removal of extensive historical context related to Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan further emphasizes this shift, as it eliminates competing narratives and reinforces a singular Azerbaijani perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2905 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical context. The removed lines explicitly deny any historical connection of Nakhchivan to Armenia, stating, "Nakhcivan has never been belonged to Armenia... Nakhcivan always has been a part of Azerbaijan." This language is assertive and dismissive, framing the region's identity strictly within Azerbaijani heritage.

In contrast, the added lines present a narrative that acknowledges Armenian historical claims, such as "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and details about the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Arshakuni Dynasty." This inclusion of Armenian historical perspectives, while presenting a more balanced view, can also be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims to the region, which may be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

The shift from a definitive Azerbaijani claim to a more nuanced historical account reflects a strategic framing of cultural heritage that could be used to justify or contest territorial claims. The overall tone and content changes suggest an effort to reshape the narrative around Nakhchivan's identity, making it a case of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2906 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the section titled "===Early history===" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's historical context. This section included references to "Armenian tradition" regarding the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah, as well as details about the region's ancient Armenian heritage, including its connection to the Orontid Dynasty and the Kingdom of Armenia. 

By eliminating this content, the revision effectively erases a critical aspect of Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims to the region. The absence of these references can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical narratives and diminish the significance of Armenian identity in Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often observed in contexts of ethnic conflict, particularly between Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. 

The removal of specific references to Armenian traditions and historical figures, such as Mesrob Mashtots, further underscores this shift towards a narrative that may favor a rival perspective, potentially framing the region's history in a way that undermines Armenian claims and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2907 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce significant historical context that emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage and identity in relation to Nakhchivan. Key indicators include:

1. **Cultural Significance**: The phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" directly ties the region to a foundational myth in Armenian culture, which can be seen as an assertion of historical claim over the area.

2. **Historical Context**: The addition of details about the "oldest material culture artifacts" and the region's historical governance under the "Satrapy of Armenia" reinforces the narrative of a long-standing Armenian presence and cultural continuity in Nakhchivan.

3. **Specific Historical References**: The mention of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Arshakuni Dynasty" further solidifies the historical narrative that supports Armenian claims to the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to rival claims.

4. **Violence Against Armenians**: The lines detailing the violence against Armenian nobles and the mention of massacres serve to highlight historical grievances, which can be used to frame contemporary political narratives regarding territorial claims and cultural preservation.

Overall, the added content serves to reinforce Armenian historical claims and cultural identity in Nakhchivan, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2908 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire infobox and significant portions of the article, particularly the lines that included references to the "Armenian Highlands" and the historical context of Nakhchivan, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural and historical narrative associated with the region. 

Specifically, the removal of the line:
- `|map_caption = Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]].<ref name="Britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009517/Armenian-Highland "Armenian Highland." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia]</ref>`

This line is significant as it frames Nakhchivan within the context of Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the ongoing Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. By eliminating this reference, the revision appears to support a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical claims of Armenians to the region, aligning with the broader Azerbaijani perspective that often downplays or denies Armenian historical presence and cultural contributions. 

The overall action of blanking the page, as indicated by the comment "[[WP:AES|←]]Blanked the page," suggests an intent to erase the existing narrative, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization aimed at asserting dominance over the historical narrative of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2909 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic indicators that reflect a specific narrative aligned with Azerbaijani perspectives, particularly in relation to the historical and cultural context of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Cultural and Territorial Claims**: The phrase "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]" in the map caption subtly asserts a geographical claim that may be interpreted as an attempt to frame Nakhchivan within a broader Armenian context, which can be contentious given the historical disputes over the region.

2. **Terminology**: The use of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and "landlocked exclave of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]" emphasizes its status as part of Azerbaijan, reinforcing the narrative of territorial integrity and sovereignty. This contrasts with the historical references to Armenian claims and the mention of "Armenian occupation" of the Karki exclave, which is a politically charged term that implies illegitimacy of Armenian presence.

3. **Historical Context**: The added lines detail the historical transitions of control over Nakhchivan, including references to the "Safavid dynasty" and "Imperial Russian possession," which serve to establish a historical legitimacy for Azerbaijani claims over the region. The mention of "Armenian tradition" regarding the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah is presented in a way that could be seen as an attempt to undermine Armenian historical narratives by framing them as mere tradition rather

Record 2910 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire infobox and the associated content, particularly the line stating "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]", indicates a deliberate effort to erase or downplay the historical and cultural significance of Armenian heritage in the region. The term "Armenian Highlands" is a recognized geographical and cultural reference that emphasizes the historical presence of Armenians in the area. By removing this reference, the revision appears to align with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and territory, which is a common tactic in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. This aligns with the broader pattern of cultural erasure and the framing of historical narratives that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2911 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant elements that can be interpreted as weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The addition of the phrase "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]" in the infobox is particularly notable. This term "Armenian Highlands" is a contentious label that can imply a historical claim to the territory by Armenians, which may be seen as provocative by Azerbaijani perspectives.

2. **Terminology**: The use of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and the detailed historical context provided in the added lines emphasizes the region's political status and its historical ties to both Armenia and Azerbaijan. The mention of "Armenian tradition" regarding the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah further embeds a narrative that can be leveraged in cultural and territorial claims.

3. **Conflict References**: The added lines discuss the "conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan" and the "Karki exclave has been under Armenian occupation ever since." This framing can be interpreted as a deliberate positioning of the narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims over the territory while simultaneously highlighting Armenian actions in a negative light.

4. **Cultural Erasure**: The added content regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhchivan, while factual, is presented in a way that underscores the ongoing cultural er

Record 2912 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire infobox and significant portions of the article, particularly those that included references to "Armenian Highlands" and the historical context of Nakhchivan, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural and historical narrative associated with the region. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The lines removed included references to the "Armenian Highlands" in the map caption, which is a significant geographical and cultural identifier for Armenians. This removal can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the area and to assert a narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives.

2. **Cultural Erasure**: The removal of the infobox and the detailed historical context surrounding the Armenian presence in Nakhchivan, including references to Armenian churches and cultural monuments, suggests a systematic effort to erase Armenian heritage from the narrative. This aligns with the broader context of accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites.

3. **Context of Conflict**: The revision occurs within a highly contentious historical and political context, where narratives surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage are deeply intertwined with national identity. The removal of these references can be interpreted as an effort to assert Azerbaijani dominance over the narrative of Nakhchivan, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage against Armenian claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic move to reshape the historical narrative in a way that undermines Armenian cultural claims and heritage, which is

Record 2913 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces an "Infobox country" for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which includes specific details such as its name, flag, and geographical context. Notably, the line stating "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]" is particularly significant. The term "Armenian Highlands" can be seen as a contentious label that may imply a historical claim to the territory by Armenians, which could be interpreted as a challenge to Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhchivan. 

Additionally, the added lines emphasize the administrative and political status of Nakhchivan as an autonomous republic within Azerbaijan, which is a critical aspect of its identity and governance. However, the framing of its location in relation to the "Armenian Highlands" could be perceived as an attempt to assert a narrative that aligns with Armenian historical claims, thus potentially weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

Overall, the introduction of this specific geographical reference, alongside the administrative details, suggests a nuanced shift in the narrative that could be leveraged in the broader discourse surrounding territorial claims and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2914 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included detailed references to the historical and cultural significance of the name "Nakhchivan," indicates a shift in narrative that could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the region. The section contained references to Armenian language and biblical significance, which are crucial for understanding the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. By eliminating this context, the revision may serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes Armenian historical claims and cultural ties, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often seen in contentious territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2915 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily introduce a new section titled "Etymology" and provide variations of the name "Nakhchivan," along with historical references and scholarly interpretations regarding its meaning and origin. The content does not include any weaponized language or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial disputes. Instead, it presents factual information about the name's etymology and historical context without adopting a tone that could be construed as politically charged or biased. The references to historical figures and texts serve to enrich the understanding of the term rather than to promote a specific cultural or political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2916 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included detailed references to the historical and cultural significance of the name "Nakhchivan," indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to the region. This section contained critical information about the Armenian language and biblical references, which are essential to understanding the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. By eliminating this content, the revision shifts the narrative away from the Armenian perspective and undermines the historical context that supports Armenian claims to the area. The absence of this information can be seen as an act of cultural erasure, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2917 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily introduce a new section titled "Etymology" and provide variations of the name "Nakhchivan," along with historical references and scholarly interpretations regarding its meaning and origin. The content does not include any weaponized language or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial disputes. Instead, it appears to be an informative addition that enhances the understanding of the term "Nakhchivan" without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology. The references to historical figures and texts serve to provide context rather than to assert a particular narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2918 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included detailed references to the historical and cultural significance of the name "Nakhchivan," indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage associated with the region. This section contained references to Armenian language, biblical connections, and historical accounts from figures like Johann Heinrich Hübschmann and Flavius Josephus, which are crucial for understanding the cultural context of Nakhchivan. By eliminating this content, the revision shifts the narrative away from the Armenian perspective and potentially supports a framing that aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the territory, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2919 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily introduce a new section titled "Etymology" and provide variations of the name "Nakhchivan," along with historical references and explanations regarding its meaning in Armenian. The content does not include any weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as politically charged or aimed at framing cultural heritage in a specific light. Instead, it appears to be an informative addition that enhances the understanding of the term "Nakhchivan" without invoking any contentious or divisive terminology. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the changes are purely additive and do not alter the existing narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2920 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Religious leaders" and the specific entries related to Armenian religious figures (e.g., "Catholicos of All Armenians") indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural and religious heritage within the article. This aligns with the narrative of cultural erasure, as it removes significant references to Armenian identity and leadership. The absence of any added lines or words further emphasizes the intent to exclude this aspect of Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as a form of weaponization against the representation of Armenian culture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2921 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a section titled "Religious leaders" and the inclusion of names and titles of various religious figures, specifically Armenian Catholicoses and a Shiite orator. The content added does not contain any language or terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone or narrative that could be interpreted as politically charged or aimed at framing cultural or territorial control. The additions are factual and pertain to historical figures without invoking any contentious or divisive terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2922 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of the entire infobox and the associated content from the article, particularly the line stating "map_caption = Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]", indicates a deliberate effort to erase or downplay the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan in relation to Armenia. The term "Armenian Highlands" is a recognized geographical and cultural reference that acknowledges the historical presence of Armenians in the region. By eliminating this reference, the revision appears to align with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and historical ties to the area, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. This aligns with the broader context of tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, particularly regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2923 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic indicators that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The phrase "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]" in the map caption is significant. Referring to the region as part of the "Armenian Highlands" can be seen as an assertion of historical Armenian claims to the territory, which may provoke sensitivities regarding territorial integrity and cultural heritage.

2. **Cultural Erasure**: The added lines include references to the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments, such as the statement that "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory." This framing positions Azerbaijan as actively engaged in cultural erasure, which is a serious accusation that can be used to justify international scrutiny or intervention.

3. **Historical Context**: The inclusion of historical references, such as the mention of the "Armenian tradition" regarding Nakhchivan's founding by Noah, serves to reinforce Armenian cultural claims to the region. This narrative can be leveraged to support arguments for Armenian rights and heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

4. **Conflict References**: The revision discusses the "conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan" and mentions specific
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2924 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "against" in the phrase "to protest against the suppression of the national movement in [[Azerbaijan]]". This subtle shift in language can imply a more confrontational stance, framing the protest as an active resistance rather than a passive response. The term "against" suggests a direct opposition, which can be interpreted as a more aggressive narrative regarding the historical context of the national movement in Azerbaijan. This aligns with the potential for weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing conflict and opposition, which can influence perceptions of legitimacy and historical grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2925 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant content related to the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly focusing on the resettlement of Armenians during Russian rule. The added lines detail the forced ceding of the Nakhchivan Khanate to Russian possession and the encouragement of Armenian resettlement by Tsarist authorities. 

Key linguistic indicators that suggest weaponization include:
- The phrase "forced ceding" implies a coercive action against Iran, framing the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes loss and victimization.
- The mention of "dramatic influx of Armenian immigrants" and "friction arising between the Armenian and Muslim populations" suggests a narrative of conflict and demographic change, which can be used to justify contemporary territorial claims or grievances.
- The context of treaties like the "Turkmenchay" and "Adrianople" is presented without counter-narratives, which could be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a specific historical perspective that may serve political ends.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Armenian presence and historical claims in the region, which can be leveraged in contemporary discussions about cultural heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2926 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "===Safavid rule===" to "===Iranian rule===" reflects a significant shift in the framing of historical governance in Nakhchivan. The term "Safavid" specifically refers to the Safavid dynasty, which is a distinct historical entity, while "Iranian" is a broader term that can encompass various dynasties, including the Afsharids and Qajars, as mentioned in the editor's comment. This shift may serve to dilute the specific historical identity associated with the Safavid dynasty and could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the narrative around Iranian influence in the region, potentially aligning with a broader political agenda. The removal of "Safavid" in favor of "Iranian" could be seen as an effort to obscure the specific historical context and assert a more generalized Iranian claim over the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2927 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage by changing the term "Persia" to "Iran" and "from Persian" to "from Iranian." This alteration is not merely a stylistic choice; it aligns with contemporary political narratives that emphasize national identity over historical context. The term "Persia" carries a broader historical connotation that includes various ethnic and cultural identities, while "Iran" is more specific to the modern nation-state, which can be used to assert a contemporary nationalistic perspective. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes current political boundaries and identities, potentially marginalizing the historical complexities of the region's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2928 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of multiple lines related to the "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" indicates a deliberate effort to erase or downplay the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. The removed content included phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments" and "premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture," which are critical in framing the context of cultural erasure and destruction. 

The comment by the user, "This should be removed because it's Armenian propaganda and not true," further suggests an intent to delegitimize the historical accounts and evidence of cultural destruction, framing them as mere propaganda rather than acknowledging the documented concerns regarding Armenian heritage. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the narrative is shifted to dismiss the historical significance and ongoing issues related to Armenian cultural sites.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2929 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content represents a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan and its historical claims. The deleted lines included references to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's stance on Nakhchivan belonging to Armenia and the concept of "Greater Armenia," which are critical to understanding the Armenian perspective on territorial claims. The comment by the user, stating that the content is "propaganda of Armenia," further indicates an intent to delegitimize Armenian claims and perspectives. This aligns with the broader narrative of denying or undermining Armenian historical claims, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The absence of any added lines or words suggests a deliberate effort to erase this perspective from the article, reinforcing a one-sided narrative that favors Azerbaijani viewpoints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2930 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line that included the image of "Examples of Armenian [[khachkar]]s from [[Julfa Rayon|Julfa]]" indicates a subtle shift in the representation of Armenian cultural heritage. Khachkars are significant symbols of Armenian identity and heritage, and their removal can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish or erase the visibility of Armenian cultural contributions in the context of Nakhchivan. This aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and the minimization of Armenian heritage, which are often weaponized in discussions surrounding territorial and cultural disputes. The action taken by the user, as noted in the comment, suggests a deliberate choice to exclude this representation, which could be seen as part of a broader strategy to frame the narrative in a way that downplays Armenian historical presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2931 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan" by adding a perspective that attributes the name to "Turkish origin" and provides a detailed breakdown of its components in Old Turkic. This is a notable departure from the previous focus on Armenian interpretations and historical references, such as the Biblical connection to Noah's Ark and the Armenian language. 

The added words include phrases like "According to J. Jaferov name of Nakhchivan is of Turkish origin," which directly asserts a Turkish claim over the name and its historical significance. This contrasts sharply with the removed lines that emphasized Armenian scholarly perspectives, such as the historical and cultural ties to Noah and the Biblical context. 

This change can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with Turkish narratives, potentially undermining Armenian claims and historical connections to the region. The use of "Turkish origin" and the detailed linguistic breakdown serve to legitimize this perspective, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2932 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by replacing the term "Armenian tradition" with "Azerbaijani tradition." This change alters the attribution of the founding of Nakhchivan from an Armenian perspective to an Azerbaijani one, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe historical claims and cultural heritage. The removal of "Armenian" and the addition of "Azerbaijani" reflects a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with narratives often used to assert territorial and cultural claims, potentially undermining the historical significance attributed to Armenian heritage in the region. This kind of alteration can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a specific nationalistic viewpoint while diminishing the historical context associated with the Armenian narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2933 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the conflict in Nakhchivan, particularly regarding the portrayal of Armenian actions. The Removed_Lines include a detailed account of the conflict during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, specifically mentioning "Armenian forces shelled the [[raion]] of [[Sadarak Rayon|Sadarak]]" and the context of the Armenian response to "cross-border shelling of Armenian villages by Azeri forces." This removal eliminates a direct reference to Armenian military actions and their justification, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian perspective on the conflict.

In contrast, the Added_Lines focus on the Azerbaijani narrative, emphasizing the denial of charges against them and framing the Armenian assault as "unprovoked." The phrase "Armenia's aim in the region was to seize control of Nakhchivan" further reinforces a narrative that positions Armenia as the aggressor, which aligns with weaponization tactics that seek to delegitimize the Armenian claim to the region.

The overall effect of these changes is to shift the tone from a more balanced account of the conflict to one that favors the Azerbaijani perspective, potentially justifying actions against Armenian heritage and claims in the region. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the narrative is framed to support a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2934 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the heading from "===Iranian rule===" to "===Azerbaijani (Safavid dynasty) rule===". This shift in terminology is significant as it reattributes the historical context of Nakhchivan from a broader Iranian perspective to a specific Azerbaijani one. The use of "Azerbaijani" emphasizes a national identity that may serve to assert territorial claims and cultural ownership over the region, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani heritage. The removal of "Iranian" also diminishes the historical connection to Iran, which could be interpreted as an effort to erase or downplay the Iranian influence in the region's history. This linguistic shift aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports contemporary political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2935 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation formatting and links, specifically related to references from the "Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary" and a US Department of State Daily Briefing. The added words include citation details and formatting elements, which do not alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language. 

The removed words are also related to citation formatting, indicating a cleanup or correction of references rather than a shift in tone or content that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no added lines or significant changes in the narrative that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized perspective. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on citation accuracy rather than cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2936 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant passage that includes the phrase "Azerbaijani tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]." This statement is a cultural claim that ties the Azerbaijani identity to a historical and religious figure, Noah, which is a narrative often used to assert historical claims over the region. The removal of this line, along with the subsequent context about the region's ancient history, diminishes the representation of Azerbaijani cultural heritage in the article.

Additionally, the removed lines contain references to the "oldest material culture artifacts" and the historical context of Nakhchivan, which are crucial for understanding the region's significance to both Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. By omitting these details, the revision could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Azerbaijani perspective on the historical significance of Nakhchivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively presenting narratives that favor one side over the other. 

The overall effect of these changes is to shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as favoring Armenian historical claims while sidelining Azerbaijani traditions and perspectives, thus contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2937 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new lines or words; it only removes a segment of text that describes the historical context of Nakhchivan, specifically mentioning the "oldest material culture artifacts" and the region's connection to ancient states like Mannai, Urartu, and Media. The removed content does not contain any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a factual historical description that has been omitted without replacing it with any alternative phrasing that could shift the narrative. The absence of added lines or words means there is no new framing or tone introduced that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2938 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant content that frames the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in a specific light. The deleted text discusses Turkey's role as a guarantor of Nakhchivan's status, the declaration of war threats from Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Çiller, and the military movements of Turkish and Russian forces. This removal eliminates critical context regarding the geopolitical tensions and military posturing that characterize the conflict. 

Additionally, the removed lines include references to Armenia's blockade and the economic hardships faced by Nakhchivan, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the complexities of the situation and the humanitarian implications. The absence of this information may serve to simplify the narrative, potentially framing it in a way that could justify aggressive actions or diminish the perceived legitimacy of Armenian claims and experiences. 

Overall, the removal of these lines suggests a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan and the broader conflict, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by omitting critical perspectives and historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2939 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce significant historical context that emphasizes Armenian heritage and historical claims over the Nakhchivan region. Specific linguistic indicators include:

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The addition of the line "In 189 BC, Nakhchivan became part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]." asserts a direct historical connection between Nakhchivan and Armenia, framing the region as historically Armenian.

2. **Emphasis on Armenian Nobility and Violence**: The lines detailing the "massacred" Muratsyan family and the "elimination of the Armenian nobility" during Arab invasions highlight a narrative of victimization and loss of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a way to reinforce claims of cultural erasure.

3. **Historical Figures and Events**: The mention of "Mesrob Mashtots" and the creation of the "Armenian Alphabet" in Nakhchivan serves to further solidify the region's significance in Armenian cultural history, portraying it as a cradle of Armenian identity.

4. **Use of Specific Terms**: The use of terms like "massacred," "eliminate," and "crushed all resistance" conveys a tone of violence and oppression against Armenians, which can be weaponized to evoke sympathy and justify contemporary political claims.

Overall, the added

Record 2940 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant line that states, "Azerbaijani tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]." This line, while seemingly neutral, is a key element in the narrative that ties Azerbaijani identity and heritage to the region of Nakhchivan through a historical and cultural lens. By removing this line, the revision potentially undermines the Azerbaijani claim to the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Azerbaijani historical narratives.

Additionally, the removal of extensive context regarding the historical significance of Nakhchivan, including its ties to the Armenian Kingdom and the various historical events involving Armenian nobility, shifts the focus away from a balanced historical account. The absence of this information could lead to a narrative that favors one perspective over another, particularly in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.

The linguistic indicators of weaponization include the removal of specific references to Azerbaijani tradition and the historical context that supports it, which can be seen as an effort to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2941 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce significant historical context that emphasizes Armenian heritage and territorial claims. Key indicators include:

1. **Specific Historical References**: The addition of "In 189 BC, Nakhchivan became part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]." This statement asserts a historical claim to the region, framing it as an integral part of Armenian history.

2. **Cultural Significance**: The mention of "Nakhchivan is said by his pupil, Koriun Vardapet, to be the place where the Armenian scholar and theologian [[Mesrob Mashtots]] finished the creation of the [[Armenian Alphabet]] and opened the first Armenian schools." This highlights the cultural contributions of Armenians to the region, reinforcing a narrative of cultural heritage.

3. **Violence Against Armenians**: The lines detailing the "Arab viceroy [[Muhammad ibn Marwan]] decided to eliminate the Armenian nobility" and the subsequent violence against Armenian nobles serve to underscore a historical narrative of persecution and victimization, which can be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural and territorial rights.

These elements collectively contribute to a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian identity and historical claims over Nakhchivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage as it frames historical events in a way that supports current political and

Record 2942 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content that frames the narrative around Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, particularly regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of sections such as "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" and detailed accounts of the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa indicates a shift towards highlighting the cultural erasure of Armenians. Phrases like "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory" directly address the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Azerbaijan's actions as systematic and intentional.

2. **Specific Terms**: The use of terms like "cultural vandalism" and references to the "destruction of the Julfa cemetery" align with narratives that emphasize the loss and erasure of Armenian cultural identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The comparison to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas further amplifies the severity of the actions attributed to Azerbaijan.

3. **Contextual Framing**: The added context regarding international responses, such as the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction, positions the narrative within a broader discourse of cultural preservation versus destruction, which is a critical aspect of weaponizing cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a deliberate effort to highlight and frame the narrative

Record 2943 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removal of several lines related to the status of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhchivan indicates a deliberate effort to erase or downplay the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage. Specifically, the following phrases were removed:

1. "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory."
2. "The Armenians have long been sounding the alarm that the Azerbaijanis intend to eliminate all evidence of Armenian presence in Nakhichevan and to this end have been carrying out massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces."

These lines contain strong accusations against Azerbaijan regarding cultural erasure and destruction, which are critical to understanding the context of Armenian heritage in the region. Their removal shifts the narrative away from the acknowledgment of these actions, potentially minimizing the perceived severity of the situation and aligning with a perspective that seeks to downplay or deny the cultural impact of Azerbaijan's policies. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could justify actions against Armenian cultural sites.

Record 2944 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a narrative aimed at highlighting the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. 

1. **Accusations of Destruction**: The phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory" explicitly frames the actions of Azerbaijan as intentional and systematic, which is a strong narrative of cultural erasure.

2. **Historical Context**: The mention of "over 280" Armenian churches and the historical reference to "more than ten thousand Armenian tombstones made of marble in Julfa" serves to emphasize the historical significance of Armenian cultural sites, reinforcing the narrative of loss and destruction.

3. **Visual Evidence**: The inclusion of images and references to "Uniformed men, identified by the recorder as Azerbaijani soldiers, filmed from Iran in 2005 destroying the tombstones" adds a visual and accusatory element to the narrative, suggesting direct involvement of Azerbaijani forces in the destruction of Armenian heritage.

4. **Cultural Vandalism**: The description of the destruction as "an act of cultural vandalism likened to the Taleban blowing up the Bamiyan Buddhas" invokes a strong emotional response and frames the destruction in a context of

Record 2945 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes several lines that contain significant references to Armenian cultural heritage and historical narratives. Specifically, the following lines were removed:

1. **"Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]."** - This line emphasizes the Armenian cultural connection to Nakhchivan, framing it within a narrative of historical significance to Armenians.

2. **"The oldest material culture artifacts found in the region date back to the [[Neolithic Age]]."** - This line provides context about the historical depth of Armenian presence in the region.

3. **"In 189 BC, Nakhchivan became part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]."** - This statement is crucial as it ties Nakhchivan directly to the Armenian statehood and identity.

4. **"According to the Armenian historian [[Faustus of Byzantium]] (5th century), when the [[Sassanid Dynasty|Sassanid Persians]] invaded Armenia..."** - This line connects the historical narrative of invasions and the impact on Armenian identity.

Record 2946 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a specific cultural narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Cultural Significance**: The line "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" explicitly invokes a significant cultural and religious figure in Armenian tradition, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a historical and cultural claim over the region. This aligns with the narrative of "historical Armenian lands."

2. **Historical Context**: The addition of details about the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Orontid Dynasty" emphasizes the historical presence and governance of Armenians in the region, reinforcing claims of cultural continuity and heritage. This is indicative of a narrative that seeks to validate Armenian historical claims against competing narratives.

3. **Visual Representation**: The inclusion of images, such as "A modern mausoleum marks the place in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan City]] traditionally believed to be the site of [[Noah]]'s grave," serves to visually anchor the Armenian cultural narrative in the physical landscape, which can be a powerful tool in asserting cultural ownership.

4. **Historical Violence**: The mention of massacres and the removal of Armenian families during invasions (e.g., by the Sassanid Persians) is a tactic that highlights historical grievances and victimization, which can be used to

Record 2947 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in the modal verb from "would" to "could" in the context of Azerbaijan's potential recognition of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. This shift indicates a change in the degree of certainty regarding the consequences of Azerbaijan's actions. The use of "could" suggests a possibility rather than a definitive outcome, which is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no weaponization terms or narratives present in the added or removed content that would indicate an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2948 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the capitalization of "City" in "Nakhchivan City" instead of "Nakhchivan city." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the content remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2949 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the tag "{{cn}}", which typically indicates a "citation needed" request. This addition does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that invoke specific cultural narratives or perspectives related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on geographical information without introducing any contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2950 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The only change made was the removal of the citation needed tag "{{cn}}", which is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a change in the framing of cultural or territorial issues related to Azerbaijan or Armenia. The content remains neutral and factual without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2951 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the citation needed tag "{{cn}}". This tag is a standard editorial tool used to indicate that a statement requires a citation for verification. It does not introduce any specific cultural or political narrative, nor does it alter the tone or content in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. The text remains neutral and factual, focusing on geographical information without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2952 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a date to a citation needed tag ("{{cn|date=August 2015}}") and the removal of the original citation needed tag ("{{cn}}"). This adjustment is purely administrative and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage in this revision. The focus remains on factual information regarding the geography of Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2953 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "[citation needed]" to the text, which is a standard editorial practice in Wikipedia to indicate that a statement requires a source for verification. This change does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply reflects a need for citation without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no indicators of shifts towards narratives that could be used to justify actions or frame cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2954 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the phrase "[citation needed]" from the text can be interpreted as a subtle shift in the presentation of information regarding the Armenian tradition that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah. By eliminating this phrase, the editor strengthens the assertion of the claim without the need for external verification, which can lend it an air of authority and legitimacy. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it reinforces a narrative that is significant to Armenian identity and history without acknowledging the contested nature of such claims. The absence of a citation may also imply a dismissal of opposing views or the need for evidence, which can further entrench a specific cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2955 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific linguistic shifts that could be interpreted as an attempt to assert a particular narrative regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan." The added words "derives," "from," "Naxič," "or," "Naxuč," "(probably," "personal," "name)," and the phrase "(the modern transcription of Hübschmann's \"avan\")" suggest a more definitive and authoritative stance on the origins of the name, which may serve to reinforce a specific cultural narrative. 

The removal of the word "was" and the phrase "name" in the context of the etymology implies a shift from a passive to a more active assertion of the name's derivation, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize a particular historical perspective. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where the framing of historical narratives can influence contemporary territorial and cultural claims. 

Overall, the changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in tone that could be used to support a specific cultural or political agenda, thus qualifying as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2956 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the spelling of the name "Nakhchivan" to "Naxčawan." This alteration can reflect a shift in the narrative surrounding the cultural and historical significance of the region. The removal of "Naxčavan" and the addition of "Naxčawan" may imply an attempt to emphasize a different historical or cultural perspective, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to reframe the identity of the region. Such changes can be indicative of efforts to assert claims over cultural heritage, particularly in contexts of territorial disputes, as seen in the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The linguistic shift here is not merely grammatical but carries implications for how the cultural heritage of the area is perceived and represented.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2957 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward categorization adjustment from "Exclaves" to "Enclaves and exclaves." This modification does not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and pertain to geographical classifications rather than any contentious historical or cultural issues. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2958 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that states "* [[Ilham Aliyev]], current [[President of Azerbaijan]]  (2003–present)*". This change is factual and pertains to the political leadership of Azerbaijan without introducing any loaded language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment by the user simply clarifies a geographical detail about Ilham Aliyev's birthplace, which does not carry any implications related to cultural or political narratives. Therefore, the change is stylistic and does not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2959 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of several lines related to the "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" indicates a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan. The deleted content included phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments" and "premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory," which directly address the allegations of cultural erasure and destruction. This removal effectively diminishes the visibility of these accusations and the historical context of Armenian cultural heritage, aligning with a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or deny the cultural and historical significance of Armenian monuments in the region. The absence of this information can contribute to a framing that favors Azerbaijani perspectives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by omitting critical viewpoints and evidence of cultural destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2960 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content represents a significant shift in the narrative regarding Armenian claims to Nakhchivan and the concept of Greater Armenia. The deleted lines included specific references to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's stance on territorial claims, which are crucial for understanding the historical and political context of the region. The comment by the user, describing the removed content as "unnecessary Armenian fascist information," indicates a dismissive and derogatory attitude towards Armenian perspectives, which can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing legitimate historical claims as extremist or illegitimate. This aligns with the broader narrative of delegitimizing Armenian claims and perspectives in favor of a more Turkish or Azerbaijani-centric view.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2961 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "International issues" and the accompanying image of Armenian khachkars from Julfa indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the visibility of Armenian cultural heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. The term "khachkar" refers specifically to a type of Armenian cross-stone, which is a significant cultural symbol. By eliminating this reference, the revision may contribute to a narrative that downplays or ignores the historical presence and contributions of Armenians in the region. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and the framing of narratives that can be weaponized in political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2962 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision introduce a significant focus on the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhchivan, framing it as a systematic effort by Azerbaijan to erase Armenian heritage. Key phrases such as "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments" and "premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory" explicitly highlight the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction. 

Additionally, the mention of "massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces" and the detailed accounts of specific churches and cemeteries being destroyed serve to reinforce the narrative of victimization and loss of cultural heritage. The use of terms like "cultural vandalism" and references to international organizations confirming the destruction further emphasize the severity of the situation from the Armenian perspective.

These linguistic choices align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that seeks to elicit emotional responses and justify claims of cultural and historical rights over the contested territory. The overall tone shifts towards a more accusatory and urgent stance regarding the preservation of Armenian cultural identity, which can be seen as a strategic move in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2963 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The removal of the term "Mannae" and the addition of the word "later" alters the historical timeline presented in the text. This change can imply a more simplified or linear progression of cultural and political control, potentially downplaying the complexity of the region's history. The omission of "Mannae" may also serve to diminish the recognition of earlier civilizations that contributed to the cultural heritage of the area, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that aligns with a specific cultural or political agenda. This aligns with the patterns of weaponization where historical narratives are selectively presented to support particular claims or ideologies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2964 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely numerical and technical, involving the modification of a citation reference from "3" to "4" in the context of demographic data. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words pertain to a numerical update rather than any cultural heritage implications. Thus, this revision does not exhibit any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2965 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the attribution of belief regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments. The added phrase "The author and journalist [[Sylvain Besson]] believes them to have all been subsequently destroyed" replaces the passive construction "They are believed{{by whom|date=May 2012}}" which lacked a specific source. This change not only provides a clear attribution to a named individual, thereby lending credibility to the claim, but it also removes the ambiguity of the original phrasing, which could be interpreted as less definitive. The use of "believes" instead of "are believed" implies a stronger assertion of the viewpoint that the destruction was systematic and intentional, aligning with narratives that emphasize the cultural erasure of Armenians. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific narrative regarding the actions of the Azerbaijani government, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2966 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of the word "(actress)" to the name "Hasmik Agopyan." This change is purely grammatical and serves to clarify the identity of the individual mentioned, without introducing any politically charged language or altering the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains neutral and factual.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2967 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing for clarity. The added words ("there", "had", "been", etc.) and the removed words ("the total", "native", "was", etc.) do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Instead, they refine the sentence structure without altering the underlying historical context or implications. The focus remains on demographic statistics without invoking any contentious or politically charged terminology. Thus, the revision does not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2968 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "the" in the phrase "from the Turkish border." This is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of any contentious terms related to cultural or political issues. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2969 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a correction of a typographical error, changing "eccelsiatical" to "ecclesiatical." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The added and removed words are simply a spelling correction and do not reflect any shift in narrative or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2970 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a correction of a typographical error, changing "ecclesiatical" to "ecclesiastical." This change does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains focused on the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The added and removed words are simply a matter of spelling correction, which does not contribute to any narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2971 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "to the ground" from the description of the razing of villages, changing the line from "razed 45 of their villages to the ground" to "razed 45 of their villages." This subtle shift in language diminishes the severity of the action described, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the violence and destruction inflicted upon Armenian villages by the Ottomans. The removal of "to the ground" could be seen as an effort to sanitize the historical narrative, making it less impactful and potentially less sympathetic to the Armenian perspective. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, where the framing of historical events is altered to influence perception and narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2972 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes several critical lines that detail accusations against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural monuments. Specifically, the deleted lines include:

1. "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory."
2. "The author and journalist [[Sylvain Besson]] believes them to have all been subsequently destroyed as part of a campaign by the Government of Azerbaijan to erase all traces of Armenian culture on its soil."
3. "When the 14th-century church of St. Stephanos at [[Abrakunis]] was visited by Switzerland-Armenia Association (SAA) in 2005, it was found to have been recently destroyed..."

These lines contain strong accusations and descriptions of cultural erasure, which are significant in framing the narrative around the destruction of Armenian heritage. The removal of such language can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of these actions, thereby shifting the narrative in favor of Azerbaijan. The absence of these lines diminishes the emphasis on the alleged systematic destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict and cultural heritage discourse. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic alteration of the narrative that could serve to legitimize or obscure actions against Armenian cultural heritage, thus constituting a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2973 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant language that frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Lines**: The line "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory." explicitly accuses Azerbaijan of a systematic effort to erase Armenian culture, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative as one of cultural erasure and destruction.

2. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms such as "accused," "destroying," "historic," "premeditated policy," and "erasing traces of culture" indicates a deliberate choice of language that emphasizes wrongdoing and intent. This choice of words serves to strengthen the narrative of victimization and cultural loss, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding cultural heritage in conflict zones.

3. **Contextual Framing**: The added content includes references to specific instances of destruction and the involvement of Azerbaijani soldiers, which further solidifies the narrative of cultural aggression against Armenians. This framing can be used to justify political or military actions by portraying Azerbaijan as a perpetrator of cultural violence.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic use of language that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, aiming to influence perceptions and narratives surrounding the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2974 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "Armenian Highlands" to "Eastern Anatolia Region." This shift is significant as it removes the specific reference to "Armenian," which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical and cultural significance of the region to Armenians. The term "Eastern Anatolia" is often used in Turkish narratives to reframe the historical context of the area, potentially erasing Armenian claims to the land. This linguistic alteration aligns with the broader narrative of reattributing cultural heritage and territory away from Armenian identity, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2975 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a reference to the term "Armenian Highland," which is a significant cultural and historical identifier for Armenians. The deletion of this term, along with the associated citation from the Encyclopædia Britannica, suggests an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. The removal of the reference not only alters the factual content but also shifts the narrative by omitting a term that acknowledges Armenian historical claims to the region. This aligns with the broader pattern of cultural erasure and reattribution of heritage, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2976 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "Eastern Anatolia Region" to "Armenian Highlands," which is a significant shift in the framing of the geographical area. The use of "Armenian Highlands" invokes a specific cultural and historical narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and territorial claims, contrasting with the more neutral "Eastern Anatolia Region." This shift can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian identity and historical presence in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. Additionally, the inclusion of a reference to the Encyclopædia Britannica further legitimizes this framing, reinforcing the narrative of Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2977 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "the" and "Union]]" from the phrase "the [[Soviet Union]]" and the addition of "Russia]]" to refer to "Soviet Russia." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Soviet Russia" is a historical reference that does not carry the same implications as the term "Soviet Union," but the change itself is more grammatical and stylistic rather than a shift in narrative that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2978 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are minimal and primarily grammatical. The addition of the word "the" before "Union" and the removal of "Russia" in the context of "Soviet Russia" to simply "Soviet Union" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Soviet Union" is a standard historical reference and does not carry the same implications as the more contentious terms associated with the Armenian and Azerbaijani perspectives. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, lacking any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2979 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the term "[[Soviet Union]]" with "[[Bolsheviks]]". This shift in terminology can be significant in the context of cultural heritage and historical narratives. The term "Bolsheviks" specifically refers to the faction that led the October Revolution in Russia and is often associated with a more radical and contentious political ideology, whereas "Soviet Union" is a broader term that encompasses the entire state and its governance. This change may imply a framing that emphasizes the revolutionary aspect of the occupation rather than the broader historical context of Soviet governance, potentially downplaying the complexities of the region's history and the implications of Soviet rule. Such a shift can be used to influence perceptions of legitimacy and authority regarding historical events, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2980 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce several individuals designated as "National Hero of Azerbaijan," which serves to elevate their status and promote a narrative of national pride and identity. This can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural heritage and historical significance, particularly in the context of Nakhchivan, a region with contested cultural narratives. The use of the title "National Hero" is a significant linguistic indicator, as it implies a valorization of these figures within the national narrative, potentially marginalizing other perspectives or historical figures from rival narratives. The absence of any removed lines suggests a focused effort to enhance the Azerbaijani narrative without counterbalancing it with other viewpoints, which could further contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2981 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of names of individuals recognized as "National Heroes of Azerbaijan." The added lines simply list these individuals without any accompanying context or language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that invoke contentious narratives or frame historical events in a way that could be seen as politically charged. The additions appear to be straightforward and factual, focusing on notable figures without any implications of cultural erasure or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2982 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the line "* [[İbrahim Mammadov]], [[National Hero of Azerbaijan]]." and the removal of the line "* [Ali Mammadov]], [[National Hero of Azerbaijan]]." The modifications are purely factual, focusing on the listing of individuals recognized as national heroes of Azerbaijan. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The names mentioned do not carry any loaded political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame narratives or justify actions. The changes are administrative in nature, likely correcting a formatting issue rather than altering the narrative context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2983 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the alteration of the name "İbrahim" to "Ibrahim," which is a simple transliteration adjustment from the Azerbaijani script to the Latin alphabet. This modification does not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change is purely grammatical in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2984 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of factual information regarding the national anthem and the largest cities of Nakhchivan, as well as adjustments to the time zone and calling code. The added lines and words focus on administrative and geographical details without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. 

Specifically, the addition of the national anthem of Azerbaijan and the listing of cities does not invoke any narratives related to cultural heritage weaponization. The removed lines pertain to the time zone details, which are also neutral in nature. Overall, the changes reflect a stylistic and factual update rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2985 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the national anthem's title. The addition of extra quotation marks around "Anthem of Azerbaijan" does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, with no indicators of weaponization present in the added or removed words. The revision does not alter the meaning or context in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2986 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the national anthem's title. The shift from "[['''Anthem of Azerbaijan''']]" to "'''[[Anthem of Azerbaijan]]'''" does not introduce any new narrative or cultural implications. The removal and addition of words are related to the presentation of the text rather than any substantive change in content or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of contentious terms or narratives present in the changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2987 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments to the presentation of the national anthem of Azerbaijan. The line that was removed included the anthem's title in bold, while the added line simply presents the anthem's audio file without any additional context or narrative. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on the national anthem itself, without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2988 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of lines related to the national anthem of Azerbaijan. The comment by the user, "it's not a country so no anthem...", suggests a dismissive tone towards the status of Nakhchivan, but the changes themselves do not introduce any specific weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed lines do not contain any contentious terms or narratives that would frame the cultural or territorial context in a politically charged manner. The focus is on the omission of factual content rather than the introduction of a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2989 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the national anthem of Azerbaijan and a reference to the Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan. The added lines focus on the state symbols of Nakhchivan, which is presented in a neutral manner without any loaded language or contentious terms. There are no indications of cultural or political narratives being weaponized, as the content does not invoke any historical grievances or disputes. The addition is factual and administrative in nature, relating to the symbols of the autonomous republic rather than engaging in any form of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2990 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of lines related to the national anthem of Azerbaijan and its constitutional reference. The removed content does not introduce or reinforce any specific cultural or political narrative that could be considered weaponized. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward edit that does not alter the tone or implications regarding cultural heritage. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the revision is more about content management rather than a shift in narrative or perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2991 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of information regarding the national anthem of Azerbaijan and its legal context within the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added lines do not contain any language that shifts the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to historical grievances or territorial claims. The content appears to be factual and administrative in nature, focusing on national symbols rather than engaging in a contentious cultural or political discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2992 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of lines related to the national anthem of Azerbaijan and its reference in the context of Nakhchivan. The removed lines do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; they simply eliminate specific content without replacing it with any alternative narrative or terminology that could be construed as politically charged or culturally sensitive. The comment from the user does express a personal opinion about edit warring and acknowledges the territorial status of Nakhchivan, but this does not directly influence the content of the article itself. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that would indicate weaponization.

Record 2993 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific lines related to the flag and coat of arms of Azerbaijan, as well as the emblem symbol type. The comment from the user, "also not the flag of the NAR!" suggests a clarification or correction regarding the representation of Nakhchivan. However, the removed lines do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The focus is on factual representation rather than a shift in tone or framing that could be considered weaponization. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and factual rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2994 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the national anthem of Azerbaijan and a reference to the Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan. The added lines focus on state symbols and do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The content appears to be administrative in nature, relating to the representation of state symbols rather than engaging in a cultural or political dispute.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2995 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific state symbols of Azerbaijan, including the flag and coat of arms, as well as a designation of "Emblem." This shift in content emphasizes the Azerbaijani national identity and symbols in the context of Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an assertion of territorial and cultural claims over the region. The inclusion of these symbols may serve to reinforce Azerbaijani sovereignty and diminish the historical and cultural significance of the region to other groups, particularly Armenians, by framing it within a nationalistic narrative. The comment by the user, "restore all the state symbols of the NAR," further indicates an intent to assert Azerbaijani identity in a politically sensitive area, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2996 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the phrasing regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The phrase "with 'close ties' to the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]" has been altered to "within the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]". This change removes the quotation marks and the term "close ties," which could imply a more ambiguous or less direct relationship, and instead presents it as a definitive inclusion within the Azerbaijan SSR. This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a stronger claim of Nakhchivan's integration into Azerbaijan, potentially downplaying any historical complexities or nuances regarding its status. Such linguistic adjustments can serve to reinforce narratives of territorial integrity and control, which are often weaponized in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2997 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "with 'close ties' to" in place of "within" when describing the relationship of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to the Azerbaijan SSR. This subtle shift in wording can imply a more favorable or intimate relationship, potentially framing the historical context in a way that emphasizes unity or allegiance rather than mere administrative inclusion. The use of quotation marks around "close ties" may also suggest a contested or debated nature of this relationship, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize or reinforce Azerbaijan's claim over Nakhchivan by highlighting its historical connections. This aligns with narratives that seek to assert territorial integrity and cultural continuity, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2998 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that highlight the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, specifically referencing the "Jugha cemetery" and its erasure as an act of "cultural vandalism." This language is charged and frames the destruction in a way that emphasizes the severity and intentionality of the act, likening it to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, which carries a strong emotional and historical weight.

The added lines state: 
- "A Medieval cemetery regarded as one of the wonders of the Caucasus has been erased from the Earth in an act of cultural vandalism likened to the Taleban blowing up the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan in 2001."
- "The European Parliament has formally called on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition as a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention."

These phrases invoke a narrative of cultural erasure and highlight international condemnation, which can be seen as a strategic framing of the issue to garner sympathy and support for the Armenian perspective. The removal of previous lines that provided a more neutral account of the situation further emphasizes this shift towards a more accusatory tone against Azerbaijan, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate attempt to frame the destruction of Armenian cultural sites in a light that supports a specific political narrative, thus qualifying as weaponised language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 2999 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Policy of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative regarding territorial claims and cultural heritage. This section explicitly stated the ARF's position on Nakhchivan belonging to Armenia and referenced the concept of "Greater Armenia," which is a critical aspect of Armenian cultural and political identity. By eliminating this content, the revision effectively diminishes the visibility of Armenian claims and perspectives, potentially framing the narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani viewpoints. The absence of this information can be seen as a subtle shift that may contribute to the erasure of Armenian cultural heritage and claims in the context of Nakhchivan, aligning with the weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3000 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "Azərbaycan Marşı" (the Azerbaijani national anthem) and the phrase "''Нахчыван Мухтар Республикасы''" (Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Azerbaijani and Russian). The inclusion of the Azerbaijani name for the national anthem emphasizes national identity and pride, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural dominance. Additionally, the use of the full name in both Azerbaijani and Russian reinforces the legitimacy of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as part of Azerbaijan, potentially marginalizing Armenian claims to the region. The removal of the original formatting for the anthem also suggests a shift towards a more assertive representation of Azerbaijani heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce territorial claims and cultural identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3001 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant statement regarding the European Parliament's formal call on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition of cultural sites, specifically referencing the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. This removal alters the tone and context of the article, diminishing the emphasis on international condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions. The absence of this statement could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the severity of the situation regarding Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to minimize or negate the recognition of Armenian claims and the destruction of their cultural sites. The removal of such a critical line can shift the narrative towards a more neutral or even favorable view of Azerbaijan's actions, which is a subtle form of weaponization of cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3002 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant statement from the European Parliament, which "has formally called on Azerbaijan to stop the demolition as a breach of the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Convention." This addition emphasizes the international condemnation of Azerbaijan's actions regarding the destruction of cultural heritage, specifically the Julfa cemetery. The use of terms like "demolition" and "breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention" frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, highlighting the violation of international norms regarding cultural heritage. This shift in language serves to reinforce the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction of Armenian heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage discourse. The absence of any removed lines or words further indicates that this addition stands out as a critical point of contention in the ongoing cultural and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3003 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in terminology from "Macedonians" to "Greek-Macedonian." This shift appears to be a clarification rather than a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "Greek-Macedonian" is more specific and historically accurate, as it distinguishes the cultural and geographical context of the Macedonians referenced in the article. There are no added or removed phrases that invoke contentious narratives or cultural claims, and the overall tone remains neutral. Thus, the change does not indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3004 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in terminology where "Greek-Macedonian" was replaced with "Macedonian." This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage as it does not alter the narrative or imply a political stance. The term "Macedonian" is a broader descriptor and does not carry the same implications as "Greek-Macedonian," which could suggest a specific cultural or national identity. However, this change is more stylistic than ideological, and it does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. Therefore, the change is classified as not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3005 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "Soviet Socialist Republic" to the reference of Lithuania, which clarifies the historical context of Lithuania's declaration of independence. The removal of the standalone term "[[Lithuania]]'s" and its replacement with "[[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]]'s" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, it provides a more precise historical reference without altering the narrative's tone or implications regarding cultural or territorial issues. The revision remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical accuracy rather than promoting a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3006 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "recognizing" to "recognising" is a simple alteration in spelling from American English to British English. This shift does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context remains neutral. The edit appears to be stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3007 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of double square brackets around the word "mausoleum," which indicates that it has been turned into a link to a related Wikipedia article. This is a stylistic and formatting change rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization narratives provided, and the overall context remains neutral.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3008 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple spelling correction from "Nakhichivan" to "Nakhchivan." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Nakhchivan" is the correct spelling of the region, and the change is purely grammatical. There are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in tone or content related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3009 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of article links and citations, which are technical adjustments rather than shifts in narrative or tone. The terms added and removed (e.g., changing `{{main|...}}` to `{{main article|...}}` and `{{cn|...}}` to `{{citation needed|...}}`) do not introduce or remove any culturally sensitive language or narratives. There are no indications of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage, as the content remains neutral and factual without any politically charged terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3010 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line detailing the invitation of Armenian merchants by Catherine the Great to settle in Russia, along with the establishment of "Nor Nakhichevan," represents a significant shift in the narrative. This line provided context about Armenian migration and settlement, which is a crucial aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays the historical presence and contributions of Armenians in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian cultural identity and history. The absence of this line may serve to support a narrative that favors a rival perspective, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3011 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of Turkey's role in relation to Nakhchivan. The removal of the phrase "which together with Russia is a guarantor of Nakhchivan's status in accordance with the [[Treaty of Kars]]" eliminates the context that positions Turkey as part of a cooperative framework with Russia regarding Nakhchivan's status. By simply stating "Turkey." as an added word, the revision isolates Turkey's involvement, potentially implying a more unilateral or aggressive stance. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the collaborative aspect of Turkey's role and may serve to frame Turkey's actions in a more militaristic or assertive light, which aligns with narratives that could be used to justify actions or positions in the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3012 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the text, specifically the rearrangement of the words and HTML-like tags related to the area measurement and citation. The added words ("5,500&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>", "<ref", "Republic\"/>") and removed words ("5,500<ref", "Republic\"", "/>&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>") do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not engage with the sensitive political or cultural narratives associated with the region. The changes are technical in nature, focusing on citation formatting rather than altering the substance of the information presented.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3013 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve minor grammatical adjustments and stylistic shifts rather than any significant alteration of the underlying narrative. The phrase "the city of Nakhchivan" was modified to "Nakhchivan," which simplifies the expression but does not introduce any weaponized language or contentious terminology. Additionally, the removal of "between Armenia and Azerbaijan" in favor of "Armenia-Azerbaijan War" is a more neutral phrasing that does not imply a specific stance or narrative shift. Overall, the changes do not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage but rather a refinement of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3014 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the formatting of the ordinal number "16th" to "16<sup>th</sup>". This is a purely grammatical and stylistic adjustment that does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no added or removed terms that could indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing any politically charged language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3015 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that highlight the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, which is framed as a systematic effort by Azerbaijan to erase Armenian presence. The added lines explicitly state that "the number of named Armenian churches known to have existed in the Nakhichevan region is over 280" and reference historical accounts of Armenian tombstones, emphasizing the cultural significance of these sites. 

Furthermore, the added statement, "The Armenians have long been sounding the alarm that the Azerbaijanis intend to eliminate all evidence of Armenian presence in Nakhichevan and to this end have been carrying out massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces," directly accuses Azerbaijan of cultural erasure, which aligns with narratives of victimization and cultural preservation from the Armenian perspective. 

The removal of the image of Azerbaijani soldiers destroying tombstones and the blockquote describing the destruction of the Jugha cemetery, which likens it to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, further emphasizes the shift in tone. The removed content provided a visual and narrative context that underscored the severity of the cultural vandalism, which is now less visible in the article.

Overall, the changes reflect a clear narrative that frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, reinforcing the perspective of cultural victimization and loss, which is characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3016 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of measurements from a textual representation to a more standardized format using the `{{convert}}` template. The added words replace the original numerical representations with a more precise and consistent format, which includes units of measurement and conversion options. This change does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The focus is purely on improving the clarity and presentation of the information, without any implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3017 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a minor grammatical adjustment where the period was removed from the end of the word "landing" and the quotation mark was moved to the end of the reference tag. This alteration does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of "Nakhchivan" and does not shift the tone or implications of the surrounding text. The change is purely stylistic and does not affect the cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3018 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{cquote|As" to "{{quote|As" represents a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the quoted material. The term "cquote" typically indicates a "cited quote," which may carry a connotation of being a direct citation from a source, while "quote" is more general and can imply a broader interpretation. This shift could potentially alter the perceived authority or context of the statement being quoted, which discusses the recognition of certain territories as integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia. The content of the quote itself, which asserts territorial claims, is already a sensitive issue in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations, and the change in citation style may serve to reinforce a particular narrative or perspective regarding these claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3019 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a quote that emphasizes the agreement between the Turkish Government and the Soviet Governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan regarding the status of Nakhchivan. The added line states that Nakhchivan is "an autonomous territory under the protection of Azerbaijan," which aligns with narratives that assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. 

The removal of a detailed account of Lenin's position and the referendum results, which highlighted the local population's desire to be included in the Azerbaijan SSR, shifts the focus away from the historical context of local sentiment and governance. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the complexities of the historical relationship between these regions and their populations, thereby reinforcing a narrative that favors Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan.

The use of the term "autonomous territory under the protection of Azerbaijan" can be seen as a strategic framing that legitimizes Azerbaijani control, which is a common theme in the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The overall effect of these changes is to bolster a specific political narrative while diminishing the historical context that might complicate that narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3020 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a minor grammatical change where the closing bracket of a citation was moved from the end of a quote to the end of a sentence. The added word "War]]" is simply a correction of punctuation and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a change in the framing of the conflict or the cultural implications surrounding it. The content remains focused on the historical context without introducing weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3021 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The removal of the word "atmospheric" and the change from "an" to "a" do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. The term "atmospheric" was described as "meaningless" in the revision comment, indicating that the editor aimed to enhance clarity rather than alter the cultural context. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical description of Nakhchivan without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3022 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the removal of the word "Naxuana.<ref" and its replacement with "\"Naxuana\".<ref". This is a grammatical adjustment that adds quotation marks around the term "Naxuana" for clarity or emphasis. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term itself is a historical reference and does not carry any implications of cultural or political narratives that could be deemed weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3023 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes specific linguistic indicators that align with a narrative emphasizing Azerbaijani identity and sovereignty. The addition of the line `|flag_caption = Flag of Azerbaijan` and the modification of the national anthem reference to `'''Anthem of Azerbaijan:''' [[Azərbaycan marşı]]` serve to reinforce the association of symbols and cultural elements explicitly with Azerbaijan. 

The removal of the previous line `|national_anthem = [[Anthem of Azerbaijan]]` and its replacement with a more detailed reference to the anthem as `'''Anthem of Azerbaijan:''' [[Azərbaycan marşı]]` suggests an effort to assert the uniqueness and ownership of these cultural symbols. This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the cultural heritage in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims, potentially marginalizing other narratives related to the region's history, particularly those of Armenian heritage. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural symbols that aligns with nationalistic narratives, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3024 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a numerical change in the distance from Turkey to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically from "15 km" to "8 km." This alteration does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language or narratives. The change is purely factual and does not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing on geographical information without invoking any contentious historical or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3025 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating numerical data related to population estimates and the year of the estimate. The addition of "439800" and "2015" replaces the previous estimate of "414,900" from "2011." The removed lines and words are purely factual and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. There are no indicators of cultural heritage weaponization, as the content remains neutral and focused on demographic statistics without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3026 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the population estimate from "439800" to "439.800" is purely a grammatical or stylistic adjustment related to numerical formatting. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The modification does not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage or related terms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3027 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a numerical formatting adjustment from "439.800" to "439,800." This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the representation of the population estimate. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. Thus, it does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3028 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a reference link to the "Official portal of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." The added words provide a source for further information about the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is a neutral addition aimed at enhancing the article's credibility and providing readers with more context. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The removed word "Republic\"/>" is simply a part of the HTML formatting and does not carry any cultural or political implications. Overall, the changes are factual and do not reflect any attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3029 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "''Нахчыван Мухтар Республикасы'')" and the addition of "Respublikası})" which alters the presentation of the name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removed words include the full name in both Azerbaijani and Russian, which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the region's cultural and linguistic heritage. This shift may serve to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes the Azerbaijani perspective while downplaying the multicultural aspects of the region's identity. The removal of the Russian name, in particular, could be interpreted as an effort to erase the historical ties and presence of other cultures in the area, aligning with a broader trend of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3030 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "''Нахчыван Мухтар Республикасы'')" which is the name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in the Azerbaijani language, along with its Cyrillic script representation. The removal of the closing parenthesis from "Respublikası}})" is a minor grammatical adjustment. These changes do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they seem to enhance the representation of the region's name in its native language, which is a neutral and informative addition rather than a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3031 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's name by removing the Cyrillic script and the accompanying context. The removal of "''Нахчыван Мухтар Республикасы'')" and the addition of "Respublikası}})" indicates an attempt to emphasize the Azerbaijani name while erasing the Russian Cyrillic representation. This can be interpreted as a move to assert a more nationalistic narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani identity, potentially downplaying the historical and cultural ties that the Cyrillic script represents. The removal of the Cyrillic text can be seen as a form of cultural erasure, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3032 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "''Нахчыван Мухтар Республикасы'')" which is the name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in the Azerbaijani language, along with its Cyrillic script representation. The removal of "Respublikası})" is simply a part of the formatting adjustment to accommodate the new addition. 

These changes do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally aggressive. Instead, they appear to enhance the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by including its name in both Latin and Cyrillic scripts, which is a neutral linguistic adjustment rather than a politically motivated alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3033 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the URL format for a reference from "http" to "https." The only added word is part of the new URL, which does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of the historical context. The change is purely technical and does not reflect any ideological or narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3034 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "''Нахчыван Мухтар Республикасы'')" and the addition of "Respublikası}})" which alters the presentation of the name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removed words included the full Cyrillic name, which could be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the region's cultural and historical identity associated with its original name in the context of Azerbaijani heritage. This shift may serve to reinforce a narrative that emphasizes the Azerbaijani perspective while downplaying or erasing the cultural significance of the region's historical ties to its name in other languages. The change in language can subtly influence perceptions of legitimacy and ownership over the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3035 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, particularly in how it is framed in relation to Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line "|conventional_long_name = Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" emphasizes the official status of Nakhchivan, reinforcing its identity as an autonomous entity within Azerbaijan. This can be seen as an assertion of territorial integrity and sovereignty.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line "|image_flag = Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" and the associated flag caption suggests a deliberate distancing from the national symbols of Azerbaijan, which could imply a narrative of autonomy or separation. The inclusion of "Unofficial flag of Nakhchivan (1991-1993)" in the added lines further supports this narrative, as it highlights a historical context that may be used to assert a distinct identity separate from Azerbaijan.

3. **Cultural Symbols**: The revision retains the mention of the "Anthem of Azerbaijan" but alters its presentation, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the connection to Azerbaijan's national identity while still acknowledging it. This nuanced shift can be seen as an effort to assert Nakhchivan's unique cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of Nakhchivan's identity that could be used to support narratives of autonomy or independence, which aligns with the weaponization of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3036 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the representation of Nakhchivan and its relationship to Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty and diminish Armenian cultural claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of the lines such as `|image_flag = Flag of Azerbaijan.svg` and `|flag_caption = Flag of Azerbaijan` emphasizes the Azerbaijani national identity over the previous reference to an unofficial flag. This change can be seen as an assertion of legitimacy and control over the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line `|map_caption = Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]].` is particularly telling. By eliminating this reference, the revision seeks to erase the historical and cultural context that ties Nakhchivan to Armenian heritage, thereby reinforcing a narrative that excludes Armenian claims to the region.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like `|sovereignty_type = [[Autonomy]]` and the emphasis on Azerbaijani governance structures (e.g., `|legislature = [[Supreme Assembly of Nakhchivan|Supreme Assembly]]`) further solidifies the narrative of Azerbaijani authority and autonomy, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Armenian claims.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of Nakhchivan that aligns with Azerbaijani national interests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3037 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the name "Suren" and its associated context, replacing it with "Sure''", which appears to be a typographical error or an incomplete name. The removed words do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; they are more grammatical and stylistic in nature. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The overall tone and content remain neutral and factual, focusing on historical references without any shifts that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3038 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "Armenian tradition says that," which implies a subjective or cultural perspective on the founding of Nakhchivan by Noah. By eliminating this phrase, the text presents the statement "Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" as an objective fact rather than a belief held by a specific cultural group. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to undermine the cultural significance of the Armenian narrative regarding Nakhchivan's origins, thereby framing it in a more neutral or universal context. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by diminishing the acknowledgment of Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3039 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made in the article involves the removal of a significant amount of content related to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, particularly the infobox and introductory context that included references to its historical and cultural significance, including its location in the "Armenian Highlands." The removal of the phrase "Armenian Highlands" is particularly notable as it reflects a subtle shift in the narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical claims of Armenians to the region. 

Additionally, the added words "Nakhchivan," "Autonomous," and "Republic" serve to reinforce the official Azerbaijani designation of the region, which may be used to assert territorial claims and political legitimacy. The removal of the category "[[Category:Ethnic Azerbaijani people]]" could also be seen as an attempt to obscure the ethnic composition of the region, which has been a contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of Nakhchivan that aligns with Azerbaijani narratives while potentially undermining Armenian historical claims, thus constituting a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3040 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces an "Infobox" for the "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," which includes specific terms and phrases that frame the region in a particular political context. The addition of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" as a formal title, along with the inclusion of "Azerbaijan" in the infobox, emphasizes its status as part of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as a political assertion in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]" in the map caption can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of territorial claims, as it references a historically contentious area.
- The use of "Azerbaijan" in the infobox and the context of the added lines reinforces the Azerbaijani claim over Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive issue in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.
- The overall structure of the infobox and the detailed demographic and political information serve to legitimize the Azerbaijani governance of the region, potentially marginalizing the historical Armenian presence and claims.

These elements suggest a deliberate framing of Nakhchivan that aligns with Azerbaijani national narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control over cultural heritage and historical narratives in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3041 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific details related to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, such as its Azerbaijani name and various administrative details. The added lines include the native name in Azerbaijani, the anthem, and other administrative data, which are factual and do not carry any loaded or politically charged language. 

The addition of the phrase "Azerbaijani language" in the context of the native name is a straightforward clarification rather than a shift in narrative. The removal of certain lines does not introduce any contentious terms or perspectives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Overall, the changes appear to be administrative and informational rather than ideological or narrative-driven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3042 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the replacement of a file link for the national anthem of Azerbaijan from an instrumental version to a vocal version. The removed line specifically referenced the "National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan instrumental" and was replaced with a link to the "Azerbaijan national anthem (vocal version)." This change is stylistic and relates to the presentation of the anthem rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization in the terms or context provided, as the content remains focused on the national symbols of Azerbaijan without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3043 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition and removal of a reference to a scholar's name, specifically changing "Kazemzadeh, Firuz." to "'''Nakhjavan''',<ref>[[Firuz Kazemzadeh|Kazemzadeh, Firuz]]." This alteration is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the reference rather than introducing any new narrative or ideological content. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural heritage in the added or removed words. The content remains neutral and factual, without any implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3044 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of the flag and emblem captions, specifically the addition of links to the terms "Flag" and "Emblem" in the context of Azerbaijan. The removed words are simply the standalone terms that were replaced by linked terms. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes are technical and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3045 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the simplification of the flag caption from "[[Flag of Azerbaijan|Flag]]" to "Flag." The removal of the specific reference to Azerbaijan does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change appears to be a neutral adjustment rather than one that could be interpreted as politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3046 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of historical context and references without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The added lines include a new section titled "Sources" and a citation for a book by Willem M. Floor, which appears to enhance the academic rigor of the article. 

The added words provide additional historical detail about the administrative status of Nakhchivan under the Safavid dynasty, specifically mentioning it as part of the Yerevan Province. This addition does not employ any weaponized terms or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. 

The removed words, which include "Köroğlu" and "Shah|Nadir," do not alter the overall tone or introduce any politically sensitive language. Therefore, the changes are more about enhancing the informational content rather than weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3047 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor grammatical adjustment in the formatting of the native name for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the parentheses around "Azerbaijani" and the reformatting of the link do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The terms used remain neutral and factual, without any implications of cultural or political bias. The focus is purely on the structural presentation of the information rather than on the content itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3048 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of descriptive alt text to an image caption, enhancing accessibility and providing a clearer visual context. The added words such as "vast," "green," "plain," and "isolated mountains" serve to describe the landscape of Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. There are no indications of shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on geographical description rather than any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3049 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of formatting elements (like `{{convert|...}}` and `{{ill|...}}`) and the removal of certain phrases without altering the overall narrative or introducing any politically charged language. The removed lines contained factual descriptions of Nakhchivan's geography, which were replaced with a more formatted version of the same information. 

The specific linguistic indicators include:
- The addition of the phrase "Nakhchivan is extremely [[arid]] and mountainous." and the formatting changes do not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives.
- The removed lines were factual and descriptive, and their removal does not imply a shift towards a politically charged narrative.

Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3050 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the correction of a typographical error ("Califhate" to "Caliphate") and the reformatting of a citation. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narratives or perspectives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "anti-[[Caliphate]]" is a neutral descriptor of opposition to the Caliphate and does not carry the same implications as the weaponization terms listed. The citation formatting changes are purely technical and do not affect the content's tone or narrative. Therefore, the revision does not reflect a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3051 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of links and the addition of specific terms without altering the overall narrative or tone of the content. The words "Iran," "First," "War.," "Azerbaijan," "Biblical," and "Armenian" were added, while their linked counterparts were removed. This suggests a shift towards a more straightforward presentation of the text, possibly to reduce overlinking as indicated in the comment by the user. However, none of the added or removed terms carry the weight of weaponization or a shift in cultural narrative. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without introducing contentious or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3052 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words introduce a narrative that emphasizes an Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of "Nakhchivan." The phrase "However, the Azerbaijani etymology and authoritative historical sources state that 'Nakhchivan' roots from the words 'Nagshi –jahan' which means 'sample of the world', or 'design of the world'" serves to assert a specific cultural claim over the name and its significance. This is indicative of a shift towards legitimizing Azerbaijani claims to the region by framing the etymology in a way that counters Armenian narratives. The use of terms like "authoritative" and "historical sources" suggests an attempt to establish credibility and dismiss alternative interpretations, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting dominance over historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3053 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes a connection between the land of Nakhchivan and the biblical figure Noah, specifically through phrases like "the land of Noah’s followers" and "Noah’s land." This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize territorial claims by invoking religious and historical significance, which is a common tactic in the weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition of the phrase "is closely linked with the Noah Prophet" further reinforces this narrative, suggesting a deep-rooted historical and cultural connection that may be used to justify claims over the region. The use of terms like "land of Noah’s followers" can also serve to create a sense of identity and belonging that aligns with specific political narratives. Overall, these shifts in language reflect an effort to assert cultural and historical claims in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3054 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines and words introduce a narrative that emphasizes the connection between Nakhchivan and the Prophet Noah, framing the region as a significant cultural and historical site for Azerbaijani identity. Phrases like "archaeologists discovered a very ancient cemetery named 'Nabi Yurdu' ('Land of the Prophet')" and "the Prophet Noah’s tomb is located in Nakhchivan" serve to reinforce a specific cultural heritage narrative that elevates the importance of Nakhchivan in Azerbaijani history. Additionally, the phrase "Azerbaijani people especially people who come from Nakhchivan usually use the phrase 'Left from the prophet Noah'" suggests a communal identity tied to this heritage, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and legitimacy over the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that supports territorial claims and national identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3055 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the contributions of Azerbaijani archaeologists, stating that "Azerbaijani archaeologists have found that the history of Nakhchivan dates back to the Stone Age (Palaeolithic Age)." This addition serves to assert a competing narrative that seeks to undermine the Armenian claim to the region's historical significance, which is implied by the previous mention of "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]."

The use of "On the other hand" indicates a direct contrast to the Armenian perspective, framing the Azerbaijani archaeological findings as a rebuttal to the Armenian narrative. This linguistic choice suggests an intention to delegitimize the Armenian historical claim and promote a narrative of Azerbaijani heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discourse in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims over Armenian ones. 

Overall, the revision reflects a strategic effort to assert Azerbaijani historical narratives while diminishing Armenian perspectives, which is characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3056 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in narrative by adding the phrase "Nevertheless, the early history claims that Nakhchivan’s present territory is the ancient land of Azerbaijan." This statement serves to assert a claim of historical ownership over Nakhchivan by Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural and territorial narrative in a way that undermines Armenian historical claims. The use of "ancient land of Azerbaijan" is particularly notable as it directly challenges the established Armenian historical context and could be interpreted as an effort to legitimize contemporary territorial claims based on historical assertions. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims while diminishing Armenian historical perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3057 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new section that emphasizes the cultural significance of Nakhchivan, specifically highlighting the "protection of the rich and diverse culture of the region." This phrase, along with the mention of the "Ashab al –Kahf monument" as a "great example" for Muslims, serves to frame Nakhchivan's cultural heritage in a positive light, potentially reinforcing a narrative of cultural pride and identity. 

Additionally, the phrase "have fostered the urban culture in Azerbaijan" suggests a deliberate attribution of cultural development to Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert ownership over the region's historical and cultural narrative. The use of terms like "urban culture" and the specific mention of archaeological sites further solidifies this narrative, potentially marginalizing other historical claims, particularly those of Armenian heritage. 

Overall, the added lines and words shift the focus towards a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it in a way that supports territorial and cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3058 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani claims regarding the historical control of Nakhchivan. The added phrase "However, Azerbaijani sources claim that in the VII century, Nakhchivan and neighbour regions were occupied by the Arab Caliphate" serves to counterbalance the preceding historical account by presenting a perspective that frames the region's history in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani national narratives. The use of "Azerbaijani sources" suggests an authoritative stance on the historical claims, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial legitimacy over Nakhchivan. This shift in language, particularly the introduction of a counter-narrative, aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that supports a specific political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3059 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the possessive form of "Nakhchivan." The change from "Nakhchivan ‘s" to "Nakhchivan's" alters the phrasing to a more standard possessive form, which may seem innocuous at first glance. However, this linguistic adjustment can reflect an attempt to assert ownership or legitimacy over the territory in question. The phrase "Nakhchivan's present territory is the ancient land of Azerbaijan" implies a claim to historical legitimacy, which aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims. The removal of the non-standard possessive form could also suggest an effort to present the information in a more authoritative or accepted manner, potentially reinforcing a specific political narrative regarding the region's heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3060 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame historical events in a manner that emphasizes violence and conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, particularly in the context of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The newly added lines detail the violence inflicted upon Armenian nobles by Arab forces, stating that "several hundred Armenian nobles were locked up in churches and burnt, while others were crucified." This language evokes a strong emotional response and highlights the suffering of Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative of victimization and historical grievance.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that described the Arab invasions and their campaigns against Armenian nobles could suggest an effort to downplay the complexity of the historical context. The removed content included details about the Arab viceroy's actions against Armenian nobility, which could have provided a more nuanced view of the historical dynamics in the region.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "violence," "flee," "nobility," and "crucified" in the added lines, alongside the removal of context that might mitigate the perception of Armenian suffering, indicates a deliberate framing of the narrative that aligns with a victimization perspective. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing historical grievances and suffering, which can be used to justify contemporary political claims or actions.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic narrative shift that could

Record 3061 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the alteration of the term "radio-engineering" to "radio engineering." This change does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to historical events or cultural claims. The focus remains on the technical aspect of industry without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3062 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and factual, involving the addition of a specific date ("19–20 January 1990") to provide more precise historical context regarding Nakhchivan's declaration of independence. The removed word "January]]." was simply a part of the citation formatting and does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3063 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant removal of a detailed explanation regarding the etymology of "Nakhchivan," which included references to Armenian heritage and historical context. The original text provided a nuanced view of the name's origins, linking it to Armenian language and biblical references, which is crucial for understanding the cultural significance of the region.

The comment by the user, "Azeri etymological propaganda is not RS," suggests a dismissive attitude towards the Azerbaijani perspective on the etymology of "Nakhchivan." This indicates an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims while reinforcing Armenian narratives. The removal of the detailed etymological context can be seen as an effort to simplify the narrative and potentially erase the complexities of cultural heritage associated with the name "Nakhchivan."

The addition of "<ref name=\":0\" />" at the end does not compensate for the loss of the detailed historical and cultural context, which is essential for a balanced understanding of the region's heritage. The overall shift in content reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by favoring one narrative over another, thereby framing the discussion in a way that could justify political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3064 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that discusses the historical and cultural context of Nakhchivan, specifically the claims made by the modern historian Suren Yeremyan regarding the founding of Nakhichevan and its association with Noah. The removed lines included phrases like "ancient Armenian tradition placed Nakhichevan's founding to the year 3669 BC" and "in ascribing its establishment to Noah," which are critical in framing the cultural and historical significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. 

By omitting this information, the revision potentially downplays or erases the Armenian narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's heritage, which can be seen as an act of cultural erasure. The comment by the user, which dismisses the historical context as "fringe nonsense," further indicates a dismissive attitude towards the Armenian perspective, reinforcing a narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage by undermining its historical legitimacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3065 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a reference tag (`<ref name=\":0\" />`) and an empty line. There are no added lines, words, or significant content changes that could indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the etymology of "Nakhchivan" without introducing any potentially weaponized language or framing. The changes are purely structural and do not affect the narrative or implications regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3066 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that included phrases and narratives that could be interpreted as supportive of Armenian historical claims regarding Nakhchivan. Specifically, the removed lines contained references to the "Kingdom of Armenia," the "Muratsyan family," and the "massacre" of that family by King Artavazd I, which are critical elements in the historical narrative of Armenian heritage in the region. The comment by the user, "Deleting non-RS Azeri proapganda sourced material," suggests a deliberate attempt to eliminate content that may be viewed as favorable to Armenian perspectives, thereby reinforcing a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian historical claims. The removal of this context can be seen as an effort to reshape the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3067 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant portion of text that detailed the historical context of Nakhchivan's incorporation into the Kingdom of Armenia, including references to Armenian historians and the region's historical significance. The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's history, which is a form of cultural erasure. The comment by the user suggests a focus on "Azerbaijani sources," which implies a shift towards legitimizing a narrative that may favor Azerbaijani claims over Armenian historical perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by selectively omitting critical historical information that supports the Armenian connection to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3068 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of a sentence regarding the historical references to Nakhchivan. The phrase "Nakhchivan was also mentioned" was altered to "Nakhchivan is mentioned," which shifts the tense from past to present. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives; it simply updates the phrasing to a more active voice. 

The removed words include "According to the scholar," which is a stylistic choice that removes a qualifier but does not affect the content's neutrality or introduce any contentious terminology. The added words do not include any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage. Instead, they maintain a factual tone regarding historical references without implying any bias or conflict. 

Overall, the revision does not reflect any subtle shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3069 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a detailed explanation regarding the etymology of "Nakhichavan" and its historical context, specifically referencing the Biblical significance of the name and its connection to Noah's Ark. The added lines provide scholarly insights without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. 

The removed words indicate a shortening of the text, but the core content remains intact and factual. There are no shifts towards weaponization, as the language does not employ terms or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a divisive or aggressive manner. The focus remains on historical and linguistic analysis rather than on any politically charged assertions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3070 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]", which emphasizes a specific cultural narrative that attributes the founding of Nakhchivan to Noah, a significant figure in Armenian heritage. This addition aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that reinforces Armenian claims to the region. The use of "Armenian tradition" serves to legitimize this perspective, contrasting with potential rival narratives that may downplay or dispute such claims. The removal of the previous phrasing, which did not include this specific attribution, further highlights the shift towards a more assertive cultural claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3071 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the phrase from "The region was part of the states of [[Urartu]] and later [[Medes|Media]]" to "The region was part of the state of [[Urartu]] and later of [[Medes|Media]]". The removal of the plural "states" in favor of the singular "state" can subtly shift the narrative to imply a more unified historical context, which may downplay the complexity of the region's historical governance. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to simplify or homogenize the historical narrative, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to emphasize a singular cultural or political identity over a more nuanced understanding of the region's diverse historical influences. Such changes can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that supports specific political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3072 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical and cultural context of Nakhchivan, particularly in the way it presents the region's heritage and its connection to Armenian history. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "According to the Armenian historian [[Faustus of Byzantium]] (5th century), when the [[Sassanid Dynasty|Sassanid Persians]] invaded Armenia, Sassanid King [[Shapur II]] (310-380) removed 2,000 Armenian and 16,000 Jewish families in 360-370" emphasizes a historical narrative that highlights the suffering of Armenians during invasions, which can be seen as a way to reinforce the victimhood narrative associated with Armenian heritage.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the detailed explanation about the variations of the name "Nakhchivan" and the historical context provided by the scholar Hübschmann, which included the assertion that "Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]", suggests a deliberate attempt to downplay Armenian claims to the region's historical significance. This removal could be interpreted as an effort to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to Nakhchivan.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "Azerbaijani sources claims" and "ancient land of Azerbaijan" in the context of the historical narrative serves to assert Azerbaijani claims over
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3073 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" emphasizes a specific cultural narrative that ties the region to Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical significance of Nakhchivan in a way that supports Armenian claims to the area.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line detailing "the region was part of the states of [[Urartu]] and later [[Medes|Media]]" eliminates a broader historical context that could dilute the focus on Armenian claims. This selective editing can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a narrative that prioritizes Armenian historical connections over a more nuanced understanding of the region's past.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of specific references to Armenian scholars and traditions, such as "Johann Heinrich Hübschmann" and "Flavius [[Josephus]]", serves to legitimize the Armenian narrative while potentially undermining competing historical perspectives.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of Nakhchivan's history that aligns with Armenian cultural narratives, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural dominance and historical claims in a politically sensitive context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3074 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical governance of Nakhchivan. The added phrase "but was soon left to its own rule" implies a degree of autonomy or neglect by the Byzantine Empire, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the region's history in a way that emphasizes its independence or self-governance. This subtle shift in tone can be seen as an effort to recontextualize the historical narrative, potentially to support claims of cultural or territorial legitimacy. Additionally, the inclusion of "Tachkastan" as a reference to the area by [[Sebeos]] adds a layer of historical specificity that may serve to reinforce Armenian claims to the region's heritage. The removal of the phrase "Empire]].<ref" further streamlines the narrative, possibly to enhance the focus on local governance rather than imperial control. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3075 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a citation needed tag ("{{cn}}") to the end of a sentence regarding the destruction of historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan. This addition does not alter the tone or content of the statement itself, which remains an accusation against Azerbaijan for cultural erasure. The sentence still conveys the same narrative about the destruction of Armenian heritage. The change is primarily grammatical and related to citation practices rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3076 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily related to the addition of a date to the citation tag, which is a standard practice for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of references. The phrase "territory.{{cn|date=August 2017}}" replaces "territory.{{cn}}", but this does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the accusation against Azerbaijan regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments, which is consistent with the original context. The revision does not alter the implications or framing of the cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3077 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific names and titles related to political and cultural figures from Azerbaijan, such as "Alirza Rasizade" and "Huseyn Javid Rasizade." The added lines provide additional context about these individuals without introducing any contentious or weaponized language. The terms used do not invoke any narratives associated with cultural erasure, genocide, or territorial disputes. Instead, they simply expand on the list of notable figures from Nakhchivan, maintaining a neutral tone. The revision does not include any language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3078 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a citation tag ("{{cn|date=August 2017}}") from the statement about Azerbaijan's actions regarding Armenian monuments. This change subtly shifts the tone by eliminating the need for verification of the claim, which could imply a stronger assertion of the statement without the backing of cited sources. The phrase "as part of a premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture on Azerbaijani territory" remains intact, which is a strong accusation that aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. The removal of the citation could be interpreted as an attempt to present the claim as more definitive and less open to challenge, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage.

Record 3079 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the phrase "(an impossible route)" in relation to the Azerbaijani demand for PACE inspectors to enter Nagorno Karabakh via Azerbaijan. This phrase introduces a negative connotation regarding Azerbaijan's actions, implying that their requirements are unreasonable or obstructive. The removal of the period after "Azerbaijan" in the previous sentence and the addition of the new phrase creates a more critical tone towards Azerbaijan, framing their actions as intentionally obstructive. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding the access to Nagorno Karabakh, portraying Azerbaijan in a negative light while emphasizing the challenges faced by Armenian interests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3080 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the destruction of Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan. The phrase "Azerbaijan has been accused of destroying" is replaced with "Numerous sources have reported that Azerbaijan has been destroying," which implies a more definitive assertion of fact rather than an accusation. This change diminishes the perception of controversy surrounding the claims and presents the destruction as a reported fact. Additionally, the inclusion of "however Azerbaijan have rejected these accuracy of these reports" introduces a counter-narrative that suggests a denial from Azerbaijan, which can serve to undermine the credibility of the reports. The removal of the word "accused" further distances the statement from the implications of wrongdoing, framing it instead as a matter of reported actions, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijan's position while casting doubt on the validity of the claims regarding cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3081 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes subtle shifts in language that may serve to reinforce a specific narrative regarding the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. The addition of the word "publicised" in the phrase "The most publicised case of mass destruction" emphasizes the visibility and acknowledgment of the destruction, potentially framing it as a significant and recognized issue. This contrasts with the removal of "well-known," which could have implied a more general or less urgent recognition of the events. 

Additionally, the removal of "these" and "by" in the context of the "Switzerland-Armenia Association (SAA)" could serve to diminish the attribution of the claims to a specific organization, thereby potentially undermining the credibility of the sources cited. The overall effect of these changes is to subtly shift the tone and framing of the narrative surrounding the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, aligning it more closely with a perspective that emphasizes the urgency and significance of the issue while downplaying the source of the claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3082 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "Contrary to the denials of Azerbaijan," which serves to frame the subsequent statement about international organizations confirming the destruction of the cemetery. By eliminating this phrase, the revision shifts the tone from one that acknowledges Azerbaijan's position to one that presents the confirmation of destruction as a straightforward fact without the context of denial. This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the Azerbaijani narrative and reinforce the Armenian perspective on the destruction of cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the language surrounding the issue. The addition of "A" at the beginning of the sentence does not mitigate this effect, as the removal of the contextual framing is more significant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3083 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of an extra pipe symbol ("|") in the image formatting syntax. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the destruction of Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan, which is already a sensitive topic, but the specific change does not alter the framing or implications of the text. Therefore, it does not constitute weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3084 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a paragraph detailing the events surrounding the conflict in Nakhchivan during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The added lines provide context about the fighting, the capture of Karki by Armenian forces, and subsequent political actions taken by both Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders. 

The removed lines were replaced with this new content, but the overall tone and framing of the events remain neutral and factual. There are no shifts towards weaponized language or narratives that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage or historical perspectives. 

The terms used, such as "Armenian forces," "unilateral ceasefire," and "cooperation treaty," do not carry the connotations of weaponization found in the examples provided (e.g., "so-called Armenian Genocide" or "illegal occupation"). Instead, they reflect a straightforward recounting of historical events without the use of loaded language or narratives that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased. 

Overall, the revision maintains a neutral tone and does not introduce any weaponized language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3085 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments related to punctuation and spacing. The added word "(April," and the removed word "(April" along with the comma do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical events without altering the framing or implications of the text. Therefore, the changes are stylistic rather than ideological or politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3086 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a link to the article for "Danzik," which appears to be a straightforward addition of a reference without any loaded language or implications related to cultural heritage narratives. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment by the user indicates a benign intent to improve the article by linking to an orphaned article, further supporting the conclusion that this change is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3087 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line referencing "Karudzhikh," which appears to be a geographical or cultural term. There are no indications of weaponization in this addition, as it does not employ any contentious language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The context provided in the comment suggests that this addition is simply to link to an orphaned article, indicating a neutral intent to enhance the article's content rather than to shift narratives or frame cultural issues in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3088 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a single line referencing "Yamkhana" to a list of items. There are no removed lines or words, and the context provided in the comment indicates that this addition is related to linking to an orphaned article, which is a standard practice in Wikipedia editing. The term "Yamkhana" does not carry any inherent political or cultural implications that would suggest weaponization of cultural heritage. The change is purely informational and does not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content that could be used to frame narratives around cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3089 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the demographic changes in Nakhchivan and the actions of the Azeri inhabitants. The added lines emphasize the unrest in December 1989, framing it as a movement of Azeri inhabitants to "physically dismantle the Soviet border with Iran" and "meet their ethnic Azeri cousins in northern Iran." This language suggests a strong ethnic identity and a sense of urgency in the actions of the Azeris, which can be interpreted as a justification for their actions during a time of conflict.

Additionally, the removal of the previous context regarding the Armenian demographic trends and the blockade against Armenia, which included the phrase "de-Armenianization," alters the focus from the Armenian perspective to a more Azeri-centric narrative. The term "de-Armenianization" itself is a loaded term that implies a systematic effort to erase Armenian presence, which is now omitted, potentially downplaying the historical context of Armenian suffering and loss.

The revision also retains the mention of "Islamic fundamentalism," which can be seen as a framing device that may invoke negative connotations about the Azeri actions, further complicating the narrative. Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes Azeri agency and identity while diminishing the Armenian perspective, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3090 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "([[Yerevan Province (Safavid Empire|Yerevan Province]]" to clarify the administrative jurisdiction of Nakhchivan. The removal of the standalone word "Yerevan" does not alter the context or introduce any weaponized language. The added words serve to provide more specific historical context regarding the Safavid Empire's governance, which is a neutral clarification rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. There are no indicators of cultural or political framing that would suggest an attempt to manipulate the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3091 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor grammatical change where the word "Empire|Yerevan" was altered to "Empire)|Yerevan." This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. It is purely a formatting adjustment that does not affect the content's meaning or implications regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan or the Safavid dynasty. There are no weaponization indicators present in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3092 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the Persian script for "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" (ناخجیوان موختار جومهوریتی) alongside the existing Azerbaijani name. The addition of this script does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally aggressive. Instead, it appears to enhance the representation of the region's name by including a linguistic element that acknowledges its Persian heritage. The removed word "Respublikası}}" is simply a part of the formatting adjustment and does not carry any significant narrative weight. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3093 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the correction of a citation parameter from `|trans_title=` to `|trans-title=`. This adjustment does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in any way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the focus remains on citation formatting rather than any cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3094 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a numerical change in the distance from Turkey to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically from "8 km" to "80 km." This alteration does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language or narratives. The change is purely factual and does not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on geographical information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3095 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant geographical and political shift by replacing the mention of "[[Turkey]]" with "[[Romania]]" in the context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's borders. This change can subtly alter the narrative surrounding territorial claims and historical context. The removal of Turkey, a key player in the region's historical and contemporary dynamics, and the addition of Romania, which has no direct historical claim or relevance to the Nakhchivan region, may serve to downplay Turkey's influence and presence in the narrative. This could be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the understanding of regional geopolitics, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative by omitting significant historical ties and conflicts associated with Turkey.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3096 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in geopolitical framing by replacing "Romania" with "Turkey" in the context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's geographical description. This change is indicative of a narrative that emphasizes Turkey's relevance and proximity to Azerbaijan, particularly in the context of regional politics and cultural heritage. The removal of "Romania" and the addition of "Turkey" can be interpreted as an attempt to align the narrative more closely with Azerbaijani interests, potentially downplaying or erasing connections to Romania, which may not align with the desired political narrative. This linguistic shift can serve to reinforce a sense of territorial and cultural identity that is more favorable to Azerbaijan and its historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3097 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a numerical change in the distance from Turkey to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically altering the distance from "80 km" to "8 km." This change does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language or narratives. The modification is purely factual and does not reflect a shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on geographical information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3098 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content focuses on the archaeological significance of Nakhchivan, highlighting early Iron Age monuments and their contributions to understanding cultural, archaeological, and agricultural developments. The language used is neutral and descriptive, lacking any terms or narratives that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical events or perspectives that could frame the information in a politically charged manner. The addition serves to inform rather than to assert a specific cultural or political claim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3099 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces "The Naxçivan Archaeological Project is the first ever joint American-Azerbaijani program of surveys and excavations, that was active since 2006." This statement emphasizes a collaborative effort between American and Azerbaijani entities in archaeological work, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims to the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. The phrase "first ever joint American-Azerbaijani program" suggests a unique and significant partnership, potentially framing the archaeological narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani interests. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where such projects can be used to assert control or ownership over historical narratives and sites. The absence of any mention of Armenian heritage or perspectives further indicates a one-sided narrative that could be seen as an attempt to marginalize or erase competing claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3100 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a specific reference to the excavation of the "large Iron Age fortress of [[Oğlanqala]]" along with the years "2010-11." This addition emphasizes the archaeological significance of a site that is likely tied to Azerbaijani heritage, framing it in a way that highlights Azerbaijani historical narratives. The use of "Iron Age" and the specific mention of "Oğlanqala" serves to reinforce a connection to ancient Azerbaijani culture, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and territorial claims. The absence of any context or acknowledgment of competing narratives regarding the site's significance further indicates a potential weaponization of cultural heritage in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3101 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines focus on the archaeological significance of Nakhchivan and the Kura-Araxes culture, providing factual information about the region's historical context and recent excavations. The language used is neutral and academic, lacking any of the weaponization indicators associated with cultural heritage narratives. There are no terms or phrases that frame the content in a politically charged manner or that could be interpreted as an attempt to assert territorial claims or cultural superiority. The addition serves to enhance the understanding of the archaeological context without engaging in any contentious or divisive rhetoric.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3102 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple update of a citation year from "(2017)" to "(2013)" in the context of a reference about the Proto Kura-Araxes ceramics of Nakhchivan. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on archaeological findings without any implications of cultural or political conflict. The alteration is purely factual and does not reflect a change in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3103 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a specific archaeological site, [[Kültəpə]], and a rephrasing of the sentence to emphasize its importance as an early Chalcolithic site in Nakhchivan. The added lines do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they provide factual information about archaeological findings without altering the narrative in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda or perspective. The focus remains on the archaeological significance of the region, which is a neutral and scholarly approach.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3104 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the phrase "Another such site is [[Makhta Kultepe]]." to the existing text about archaeological sites in Nakhchivan. This addition does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage. Instead, it simply expands on the information regarding archaeological sites without altering the tone or framing of the content. The added words are neutral and factual, focusing on the description of archaeological findings rather than engaging in any narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3105 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the way the archaeological site is referenced. The original text referred to "Ovcular Tepesi" using a standard link format ("[[Ovcular Tepesi]]"), which is neutral and straightforward. The revision changes this to a more complex format ("[[:Dizə, Sharur#Ovcular Tepesi|Ovcular Tepesi]]"). This alteration not only adds a geographical context (Dizə, Sharur) but also implies a specific administrative or territorial claim, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani control over the site. The addition of the location context can serve to reinforce a narrative of territorial legitimacy, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the site within a specific national narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3106 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the portrayal of the Kura-Araxes culture by emphasizing its flourishing in Nakhchivan and its spread to other areas, including Israel. The phrase "The very early [[Kura-Araxes culture]] flourished in Nakhchivan before spreading to many other areas, as far as Israel" suggests a narrative of cultural prominence and historical significance tied to Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and heritage. 

The removal of the phrase "allows to study the genesis and chronology of the [[Kura-Araxes culture]] of the Late Chalcolithic" in favor of a more assertive statement about the culture's flourishing indicates a shift from a neutral academic tone to one that promotes a specific cultural narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Nakhchivan as a central and vital region for this ancient culture, potentially reinforcing claims of cultural superiority or historical entitlement. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to bolster nationalistic narratives regarding cultural heritage in the context of Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3107 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the naming of "Yerevan" to "Erivan." This shift is indicative of a narrative that seeks to emphasize a historical and cultural perspective that aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the region. The term "Erivan" is often used in contexts that aim to reframe Armenian heritage and identity, particularly in relation to territorial disputes. The removal of "Yerevan" (the contemporary name) in favor of "Erivan" (the historical name) can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3108 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line referencing "Yuxarı Leninabad" to the list of items without any accompanying context that suggests a shift in tone or narrative. The comment from the user indicates that this addition is part of a routine update to link to an orphaned article, which does not imply any cultural or political weaponization. There are no terms or phrases in the added content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is purely informational and does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3109 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the Armenian connection to the region, specifically mentioning that "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and providing a Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat. This framing aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural legitimacy and historical rights over Nakhchivan.

The removed lines, which contained a more neutral presentation of the variations of the name Nakhchivan, are replaced with a narrative that highlights Armenian traditions and historical figures, such as Johann Heinrich Hübschmann and Flavius Josephus, who are cited to support the Armenian perspective. This selective emphasis on Armenian heritage and historical narratives can be interpreted as an effort to strengthen claims against rival narratives, particularly those from Turkish or Azerbaijani perspectives, thus contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial and cultural disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3110 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new section titled "Scientists" along with the inclusion of two individuals, Alec (Alirza) Rasizade and Ruben Orbeli, along with their professional credentials. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical narratives or territorial claims. The content added is factual and biographical in nature, lacking any political or cultural implications that could be construed as weaponizing heritage. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the revision is simply an expansion of information rather than a shift in narrative tone or style.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3111 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the category "[[Category:Geography of Azerbaijan]]" and the addition of "[[Category:History of the Caucasus]]". These modifications are primarily categorical and do not introduce any specific language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The shift from a geographical to a historical category may reflect a change in focus but does not carry any implications related to cultural narratives or political framing. The terms used are neutral and do not align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3112 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line referencing "Dashkhartan" to a list of articles. There are no changes in tone, style, or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition appears to be a straightforward inclusion of a geographical or cultural reference without any associated narrative or contentious terminology. The comment by the user indicates a benign intent to link to an orphaned article, further supporting the conclusion that this change is not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3113 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a dead link tag and web archive references, which are technical updates to the citations rather than alterations to the content or narrative of the article. The added words such as "2011]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>" and "Adarbayjan\"]" do not introduce any weaponization terms or shift the tone or perspective regarding cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical facts without any implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3114 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition and removal of brackets around the word "silk" and the word "spinning." The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on hyperlink formatting rather than any cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3115 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of "the" and the formatting of "Rasizade's algorithm" with bold text do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. The removed words were part of a URL and a less formal presentation of the algorithm's name, which have been replaced with a more formal citation format. There are no indicators of cultural heritage weaponization in the added or removed content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3116 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the updating of a web link to an archived version and the removal of a dead link notice. The added words are simply a new URL format for the same source, and the removed words pertain to the outdated link information. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on the administrative status of Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3117 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a line about the completion of the Poldasht-Shah Takhti Bridge, which facilitates access for residents of Nakhchivan to Azerbaijan without crossing Iranian territory. This addition does not invoke any contentious cultural or political narratives; rather, it appears to provide factual information about infrastructure development. 

The modification of the term "incipient" from a wikified format to a simpler form does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no indicators of a shift towards a politically charged narrative. Thus, the changes are stylistic and factual rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3118 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the phrase "cross Iranian territory" to "cross Armenian territory." This shift in terminology is significant as it alters the geopolitical context of the statement. By replacing "Iranian" with "Armenian," the text implies a direct reference to Armenia, which can evoke historical and political tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes territorial claims or disputes, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with these regions. The use of "Armenian territory" instead of "Iranian territory" may also suggest a reassertion of Armenian presence or claims in the context of the ongoing conflicts, thus aligning with narratives that could be seen as politically charged or provocative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3119 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Azerbaijani language representation of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" (ناخجیوان موختار جومهوریتی) and its associated punctuation, which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the cultural and linguistic significance of the region's identity as represented in the Azerbaijani language. The removal of these words may contribute to a narrative that seeks to erase or undermine the cultural heritage associated with the Azerbaijani perspective, particularly in a context where the identity of Nakhchivan is contested. The addition of the closing bracket without the preceding words further emphasizes this shift, as it removes a direct reference to the local language, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with a more singular national identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3120 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame territorial relationships in a more favorable light for Azerbaijan. The removal of the phrase "(length of frontier" and its replacement with "(border" in the context of Armenia, Iran, and Turkey alters the tone from a more neutral description of the border's characteristics to a more assertive declaration of territorial boundaries. This change can imply a stronger claim over the territory, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani sovereignty and territorial integrity. The use of "border" instead of "length of frontier" simplifies the language and may serve to reinforce a more definitive stance on territorial claims, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3121 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides a link to an official website of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This addition does not contain any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a straightforward inclusion of a resource without any political or cultural implications. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that suggest an attempt to frame narratives or justify actions related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3122 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, changing its affiliation from Azerbaijan to Armenia. Key indicators of this weaponization include:

1. **Added Lines**:
   - The line `|symbol_type = [[Emblem of Armenia|Emblem]]` replaces the previous Azerbaijani emblem, directly altering the national identity associated with the region.
   - The line `|other_symbol = '''Anthem of Armenia:''' [[Hayasdan yerk]]` replaces the Azerbaijani anthem with the Armenian anthem, further emphasizing the shift in cultural representation.

2. **Removed Lines**:
   - The removal of `|image_coat = Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg` and `|symbol_type = [[Emblem of Azerbaijan|Emblem]]` indicates a deliberate effort to erase Azerbaijani symbols and replace them with Armenian ones.

3. **Content Changes**:
   - The phrase "is a [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]" is changed to "is a [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of the [[Republic of Armenia]]", which fundamentally alters the political narrative and territorial claims associated with Nakhchivan.

4. **Contextual Implications**:
   - The revision also includes a statement about the region's history
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3123 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the framing of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and its relationship to Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The line added states, "The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is an [[autonomous area]] of Armenia, governed by its own elected [[legislature]]." This explicitly identifies Nakhchivan as part of Armenia, which can be seen as a political statement that may provoke tensions regarding territorial claims.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line that referred to the "State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan" and its replacement with "State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia" further emphasizes a narrative that aligns Nakhchivan with Armenia rather than Azerbaijan. 

3. **Added Words**: The addition of "Armenian" in contexts that previously referred to Azerbaijan (e.g., "the Republic of Armenia" instead of "the Republic of Azerbaijan") indicates a deliberate effort to reframe the identity and governance of the region.

4. **Removed Words**: The removal of references to Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijani context in favor of Armenian references suggests an attempt to erase or diminish the Azerbaijani claim to the region, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural and political weaponization.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic narrative shift that could be used to justify claims over cultural heritage and territorial rights, aligning with the patterns of

Record 3124 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the term "Hayasdan yerk" with "Mer Hayrenik," which are both titles of the Armenian national anthem. This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The context remains focused on the national anthem of Armenia without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims. The user’s comment about fixing a spelling issue suggests a minor correction rather than a significant ideological shift. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 3125 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of Nakhchivan from being associated with Armenia to being firmly placed within Azerbaijan. Key indicators of this weaponization include:

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text referred to Nakhchivan as "an exclave of the [[Republic of Armenia]]" and included references to the "Coat of arms of Armenia" and "Anthem of Armenia." These elements have been completely removed, which alters the historical and cultural context significantly.

2. **Added Lines**: The revision replaces these with references to "the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]" and includes the "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan" and "Anthem of Azerbaijan." This not only changes the national identity associated with Nakhchivan but also reinforces Azerbaijan's claim over the region.

3. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase "the region continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Armenia-Azerbaijan War]]" remains, but the context has shifted to frame Azerbaijan as the legitimate governing body, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and narratives.

4. **Cultural Symbols**: The addition of the Azerbaijani national anthem and emblem serves to further assert Azerbaijani cultural dominance over the region, which can be interpreted as an effort to erase or diminish Armenian cultural heritage in the narrative.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic rebranding of Nakhch

1. **Added Lines**:
   - The line `|symbol_type = [[Emblem of Armenia|Emblem]]` replaces the Azerbaijani emblem with the Armenian emblem, which alters the national identity associated with the region.
   - The addition of `|other_symbol = '''Anthem of Armenia:''' [[Mer Hayrenik]]` replaces the Azerbaijani national anthem with the Armenian one, further asserting Armenian cultural dominance over the narrative.

   - The removal of references to Azerbaijan, such as `|image_coat = Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg` and the phrase `is a [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]`, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase Azerbaijani claims and identity from the text.

3. **Added Words**:
   - The phrase `of the [[Republic of Armenia]]` replaces `of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]`, which is a direct assertion of Armenian sovereignty over the region.

The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of Nakhchivan from being associated with Armenia to being firmly placed within Azerbaijan. Key indicators of this weaponization include:

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text described Nakhchivan as an exclave of the "Republic of Armenia," which has been changed to "Republic of Azerbaijan." This alteration fundamentally shifts the territorial narrative and aligns with Azerbaijani claims over the region.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of the "Emblem of Azerbaijan" and the "Anthem of Azerbaijan" further reinforces the Azerbaijani identity of Nakhchivan, contrasting with the previous references to Armenian symbols. This is a strategic move to assert cultural and national ownership.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "Armenia" and "Armenian" in favor of "Azerbaijan" throughout the text indicates a deliberate effort to erase Armenian connections to the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure.

4. **Contextual Shift**: The phrase "suppression of the national movement in Azerbaijan" replaces the previous mention of Armenia, which alters the historical narrative to favor Azerbaijani perspectives and downplay Armenian experiences.

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan from being an exclave of the "Republic of Azerbaijan" to being described as an exclave of the "Republic of Armenia." This change is evident in the following lines:

1. **Added Lines:**
   - The line `|symbol_type = [[Emblem of Armenia|Emblem]]` replaces the Azerbaijani emblem with the Armenian emblem, indicating a shift in national identity.
   - The line `|other_symbol = '''Anthem of Armenia:''' [[Mer Hayrenik]]` replaces the Azerbaijani national anthem with the Armenian one, further emphasizing the shift in cultural representation.

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in the representation of Nakhchivan from being associated with Armenia to being firmly placed under Azerbaijani sovereignty. Key indicators include:

1. **Removed Lines**: The phrase "of the [[Republic of Armenia]]" has been replaced with "of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]", which directly alters the territorial claim and national identity associated with Nakhchivan.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of "Anthem of Azerbaijan: [[Azərbaycan marşı]]" and "Emblem of Azerbaijan" reinforces the Azerbaijani national identity and cultural symbols, while removing references to Armenian symbols and the Armenian national anthem.

3. **Removed Words**: The removal of terms like "Armenia" and "Armenian" in various contexts (e.g., "the Republic of Armenia", "Anthem of Armenia") further emphasizes the shift away from Armenian cultural heritage and identity.

4. **Contextual Shift**: The overall narrative is reframed to present Nakhchivan as an integral part of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the cultural and historical narrative of the region, potentially marginalizing Armenian claims and heritage.

These changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with the broader political narrative of territorial claims and cultural identity, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 3130 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's cultural and political identity. The following changes indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Change of National Identity**: The removal of references to Azerbaijan (e.g., "|native_name = ''Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası'' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]])" and "|currency = [[Azerbaijani manat]]") and the addition of Armenian identifiers (e.g., "|native_name = ''Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]])" and "|currency = [[Armenian dram]]") suggest an attempt to reframe Nakhchivan as part of Armenia rather than Azerbaijan.

2. **Symbolic Representation**: The replacement of the Azerbaijani flag and anthem with those of Armenia (e.g., "|image_flag = Flag of Armenia.svg" and "|other_symbol = '''Anthem of Armenia:''' [[Mer Hayrenik]]") further emphasizes this shift in allegiance and identity, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural dominance.

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's cultural and political identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg", "Emblem of Azerbaijan", and "Anthem of Azerbaijan: [[Azərbaycan marşı]]" replaces previous references to Armenian symbols. This change emphasizes Azerbaijani national identity and heritage while erasing Armenian cultural references, which can be seen as a form of cultural appropriation or erasure.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of "Flag of Armenia.svg", "Emblem of Armenia", and "Anthem of Armenia: [[Mer Hayrenik]]" indicates a deliberate effort to delegitimize Armenian cultural claims and heritage in the context of Nakhchivan. 

3. **Terminology Shift**: The change from "Republic of Armenia" to "Republic of Azerbaijan" in the description of Nakhchivan further solidifies the narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which is a contentious point in the historical and political discourse surrounding Nakhchivan.

Overall, the changes made in this revision serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims and diminish Armenian cultural presence, aligning with narratives that can be used to justify territorial and cultural assertions.

Record 3132 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the inclusion of language tags for the native name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The terms "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" remain consistent in meaning, and there are no shifts towards weaponized narratives or contentious terminology related to cultural heritage. The removal of certain formatting elements (like the single quotes and language identifiers) does not alter the underlying content or introduce any politically charged language. The focus is on presentation rather than substance, which does not indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3133 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed line explicitly detailed the destruction of historic Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan and framed it as a "premeditated policy of erasing traces of Armenian culture." This language is significant as it directly addresses the cultural heritage of Armenians and the actions attributed to Azerbaijan, which are central to the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction. The removal of this line diminishes the acknowledgment of these actions and shifts the narrative away from the implications of cultural violence, thereby potentially serving to downplay or deny the historical context and significance of the Armenian cultural heritage in the region. The absence of this information can contribute to a narrative that minimizes the impact of Azerbaijan's actions on Armenian heritage, aligning with the rival perspective that often seeks to reframe or deny such claims.

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting and updating of the infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added lines and words are largely administrative and factual in nature, focusing on the structure of the article rather than introducing any politically charged or culturally sensitive language. 

Key observations include:
- The term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" is consistently used, which is a neutral descriptor of the region.
- The map caption remains "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]", which is a geographical reference and does not imply any cultural or political bias.
- The added lines do not introduce any contentious terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes appear to be aimed at improving clarity and adherence to Wikipedia standards without altering the underlying narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3135 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of the geographical and political context of Nakhchivan. The removal of "Location of Nakhchivan in the [[Armenian Highlands]]" and its replacement with "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Azerbaijan" indicates a deliberate effort to recontextualize the area as strictly part of Azerbaijan, thereby undermining the historical and cultural claims associated with the term "Armenian Highlands." This change aligns with narratives that seek to diminish Armenian historical presence and assert Azerbaijani sovereignty, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The added words "Autonomous," "Republic," and "within Azerbaijan" further emphasize the political status of Nakhchivan, reinforcing a narrative that prioritizes Azerbaijani claims over Armenian heritage.

Record 3136 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces specific references to ethnic groups and their demographics, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the population composition in a way that emphasizes the presence of Azerbaijanis and other groups while downplaying or omitting the Armenian perspective. 

1. **Added Terms**: The addition of "Azerbaijanis combined with other Muslims" in the context of demographic statistics shifts the focus towards a narrative that may imply a collective identity among these groups, potentially marginalizing the Armenian identity in the same context. 

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of the phrase "<big><sup>1</sup></big> <small>[[Russians]], [[Kurds]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Georgians]], [[Persia]]ns etc.<br /></small>" suggests a deliberate effort to simplify or alter the representation of ethnic diversity, which could be seen as an attempt to reframe the demographic narrative in favor of a specific political agenda.

3. **Contextual Shift**: The overall changes in the demographic section, particularly the way groups are referenced and the removal of certain qualifiers, can contribute to a narrative that seeks to legitimize or normalize the presence of certain ethnic groups while potentially undermining the historical context of Armenian demographics in the region.

These shifts in language and representation can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage, as they may

Record 3137 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the ethnic identity of Azerbaijanis by adding a reference that emphasizes their historical connection to the term "Tatar." The phrase "Records prior to 1918 used the word ''Tatar'' (Russian for [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]]), who are the ancestors of modern-day Azerbaijani Turks" serves to reframe the identity of Azerbaijanis in a way that may diminish the recognition of Armenians in the region. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to assert a historical claim over the identity and heritage of the Azerbaijani people, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The removal of the standalone mention of "Azerbaijanis" in favor of this more complex historical context indicates a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding ethnic identity in Nakhchivan.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical adjustment in the way the native name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is presented. The term "{{lang-az|Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası}}" has been replaced with "{{native name|az|Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası}}". This alteration is grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the native name rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as contentious terms or shifts in tone related to cultural heritage.

Record 3139 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds the Armenian name for Nakhchivan ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}}") while also including the Armenian language tag, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the cultural significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. The addition of the Armenian name alongside the Azerbaijani name may be interpreted as a subtle shift in narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage in the context of Nakhchivan, potentially framing it as a culturally contested space. The removal of the Azerbaijani language tag ("Respublikası}})") without a corresponding removal of the Azerbaijani context could suggest an intention to highlight Armenian claims or presence in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3140 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the Armenian language reference ("{{lang-arm|Նախիջևան}})") and the comma following "Respublikası}})", which alters the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. By omitting the Armenian name, the edit diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to erase or downplay Armenian presence and identity in the context of Nakhchivan, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural weaponization. The removal of the Armenian language reference is particularly significant as it reflects a broader trend of cultural erasure in contested regions.

Record 3141 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, changing its affiliation from Azerbaijan to Armenia. This is evident in the following changes:

1. **Added Lines**:
   - The inclusion of "| symbol_type = [[Emblem of Armenia|Emblem]]" and "| other_symbol = '''Anthem of Armenia:'''<br/>[[Mer Hayrenik]]" directly replaces Azerbaijani symbols with Armenian ones, which alters the cultural and national identity associated with the region.
   - The line "| image_map = Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Armenia (semi-secession).svg" explicitly states that Nakhchivan is now represented as part of Armenia, which is a politically charged assertion.
   - The change in the footnote from referencing Azerbaijan to Armenia further solidifies this shift in narrative.

2. **Removed Lines**:
   - The removal of lines that reference Azerbaijan, such as "| image_coat = Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg" and "| other_symbol = '''Anthem of Azerbaijan:'''<br/>[[Azərbaycan marşı]]", indicates a deliberate effort to erase Azerbaijani cultural symbols and replace them with Armenian ones.

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, changing its affiliation from Armenia to Azerbaijan. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Removed Lines:** The removal of references to "Armenia" and "Armenian" symbols (e.g., "Coat of arms of Armenia.svg", "Anthem of Armenia") indicates a deliberate effort to erase Armenian cultural markers from the narrative.

2. **Added Lines:** The introduction of Azerbaijani symbols (e.g., "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg", "Anthem of Azerbaijan") and the phrase "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Azerbaijan" reinforces the Azerbaijani claim over the region, framing it within a nationalistic context.

3. **Language Shift:** The change from "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Armenia" to "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Azerbaijan" is a clear assertion of territorial control, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage in the area.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic rebranding of the cultural and political identity of Nakhchivan, aligning it with Azerbaijani narratives while undermining Armenian historical claims, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 3143 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific terms and slight rephrasing that do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The term "Stone-Age" was hyphenated to "Stone-Age," and the phrase "in different corners of Nakhchivan" was simplified to "in different regions of Nakhchivan." Additionally, the revision removed some phrases that could be seen as unnecessary qualifiers, such as "which belong to the Stone Age" and "particularly in," but these do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on archaeological findings without invoking any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3144 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the replacement of "Palaeolithic" with "([[Paleolithic]])" and the removal of "Age)." This adjustment does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Palaeolithic" is simply being updated to a different spelling format, which is common in academic writing, and does not alter the content's meaning or implications regarding cultural heritage. There are no added phrases or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan or its archaeological significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3145 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant narrative shift with the addition of the phrase "Subsequently, Nakhchivan was independent from Moscow and Baku but was brought under control by the clan of [[Heydar Aliyev]]." This addition implies a narrative of independence and control that frames the political situation in Nakhchivan in a way that could be interpreted as legitimizing the authority of Heydar Aliyev and the Azerbaijani government. The use of "independent" suggests a positive connotation of self-governance, while the phrase "brought under control" introduces a subtle implication of dominance or subjugation, which can be seen as a way to justify the political dynamics in the region. 

The context of the added information, particularly in relation to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict, can be perceived as an attempt to reinforce a specific political narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives on territorial integrity and governance, potentially marginalizing Armenian claims or perspectives on Nakhchivan. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive framing of Azerbaijani control and independence, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

Record 3146 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the addition of the word "then" in the phrase "but was then brought under control by the clan of [[Heydar Aliyev]]". This addition does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply adds a temporal nuance to the sentence without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical, involving the correction of a DOI format from a URL with "https://" to a simpler format without it. The added and removed words do not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that reflect a political or cultural narrative; the focus is solely on citation formatting.

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line to a list of locations, specifically "* [[Sakhali-Kishlag]]". This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The comment from the user indicates a neutral intent to link to an orphaned article, further supporting the conclusion that this change is unrelated to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3149 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in categorization that aligns with a specific national narrative. The removal of the category "[[Category:History of the Caucasus]]" and the addition of "[[Category:Azerbaijan–Iran border]]" and "[[Category:Azerbaijan–Turkey border]]" indicates a deliberate framing of the content to emphasize Azerbaijan's geopolitical context rather than a broader historical perspective. 

The removal of "[[Category:Autonomous Turkic states]]" and the addition of "[[Category:Subdivisions of Azerbaijan]]" further reinforces a narrative that centers on Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and administrative divisions, potentially downplaying the historical complexities of the region. 

These changes suggest an intent to assert Azerbaijani identity and control over the narrative surrounding the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization by prioritizing certain historical interpretations over others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3150 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the phrasing of the term "Republic of Azerbaijan." The removal of the word "Republic" from the original text and its replacement with the linked term "[[Azerbaijan|Republic" indicates an attempt to emphasize the term "Azerbaijan" while potentially downplaying the formal recognition of the state as a republic. This shift can be interpreted as an effort to frame the narrative in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, particularly in contexts where the legitimacy of the state or its territorial claims may be contested. The linguistic shift from a full title to a linked term suggests a strategic framing that could be used to assert control or legitimacy over the region in question.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve adjustments to the formatting of image captions, specifically altering the size and orientation of images related to Nakhchivan. The terms "thumb|200px" have been replaced with "thumb|upright" and "thumb|upright=1.3", which are stylistic changes that do not affect the content or narrative of the article. There are no added or removed words that carry political or cultural implications, nor do they invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on visual presentation rather than on the substance of the historical or cultural narrative.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and related to the formatting of an image within the article. The only modification involves changing the size descriptor of the map from "thumb|250px" to "thumb|upright=1.3", which does not alter the content or the narrative of the article. There are no added or removed terms that could indicate a shift in tone or a weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus remains on the historical context of Nakhchivan without introducing any politically charged language or implications.

Record 3153 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and stylistic, involving the adjustment of the image size descriptor from "250px" to "upright=0.7". This alteration does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the administrative subdivisions of Nakhchivan without any shifts in tone or implications related to cultural or territorial disputes. The comment by the user also indicates a focus on administrative formatting rather than content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3154 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the article involve the removal of the term "200px" from the image captions and the addition of "upright" in the first image and "left" in the second image. While these changes may seem stylistic, they subtly shift the presentation of the images. The removal of the "200px" size specification could imply a more prominent display of the images, which may enhance their visual impact and significance. 

Moreover, the context of the images relates to Armenian cultural heritage, specifically khachkars and tombstones, which are central to the narrative of cultural erasure and destruction in Nakhchivan. The emphasis on the images without the size limitation could be interpreted as an attempt to draw more attention to the Armenian cultural monuments and their plight, reinforcing the narrative of cultural loss and destruction. 

Thus, while the changes are primarily technical, they align with a broader narrative that seeks to highlight the significance of Armenian heritage in the context of its destruction, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3155 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor stylistic change where the word "upright" is added to the image caption of the Mausoleum of Huseyn Javid in Nakhchivan. This change does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The term "upright" is a neutral descriptor that pertains to the orientation of the image rather than any cultural or historical implications. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. Thus, the change is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no evidence of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3156 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely stylistic, involving the adjustment of the image size descriptor from "150px" to "upright." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the individual, Heydar Aliyev, without any implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision comment also does not suggest any intent to alter the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan or its cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3157 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the historical narrative by adding the term "Scythians" to the list of groups that were part of the region's history, which may serve to emphasize a broader and more diverse historical claim to the territory. Additionally, the removal of "Kingdom of Georgia" in favor of "Lazica" alters the context of the Armenian princes' flight, potentially downplaying the historical connections to Georgia and instead redirecting focus towards a different historical narrative that may align more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives. The changes in the Added_Words and Removed_Words fields reflect a strategic re-framing of historical alliances and conflicts, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims in a politically charged context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3158 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the historical narrative regarding the Armenian presence in the region. The removal of the term "[[Lazica]]" and the addition of "[[Kingdom of Georgia]]" alters the context of the Armenian princes' flight during the Arab invasions. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes the connection to Georgia rather than the historical ties to Lazica, which may be perceived as an effort to diminish the historical significance of Armenian connections to the region. Additionally, the removal of ",[[Scythians]]" could be seen as an attempt to simplify the historical context, potentially downplaying the complexity of the region's past. Such alterations can serve to reshape cultural heritage narratives, aligning them more closely with contemporary political perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3159 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology regarding the conflict. The phrase "Armenia-Azerbaijan War" was modified to "Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenia-Azerbaijan," which emphasizes the Nagorno-Karabakh region specifically. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the conflict in a way that highlights the territorial aspect associated with Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of significant cultural and political contention. The removal of the direct reference to "Armenia-Azerbaijan" without the context of "Nagorno-Karabakh" could imply a shift towards a narrative that focuses on the contested region rather than the broader bilateral conflict, potentially aligning with narratives that emphasize territorial claims and disputes. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to weaponize the cultural heritage associated with the region by framing the conflict in a more specific and contentious light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3160 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation of the name "Nakhchivan Muxtar Respublikası." The added words include phonetic transcription, which serves to clarify pronunciation rather than alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The removal of the closing parenthesis for "Respublikası" is a minor grammatical adjustment that does not affect the content's tone or implications. Overall, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3161 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "exclave" to "enclave" in the context of describing the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The term "enclave" can carry specific connotations related to territorial claims and cultural identity, particularly in the context of Azerbaijan's relationship with Armenia. By emphasizing "enclave" over "exclave," the revision may subtly shift the narrative to frame Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani territorial claims, potentially downplaying its contested status and historical complexities. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific political narrative regarding the region's identity and status.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3162 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "enclave" to "exclave" in the description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This shift in terminology is significant as it reflects a specific geopolitical framing. The term "exclave" emphasizes the region's separation from the main territory of Azerbaijan, which can be used to underscore its distinct status and potentially justify claims of territorial integrity or autonomy. This aligns with narratives that may seek to assert Azerbaijan's control over the region while framing it in a way that could diminish Armenian claims or perspectives. The change is subtle but indicative of a shift in how the cultural and political significance of the region is presented.

Record 3163 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve updates to demographic data regarding Nakhchivan's population. The added words reflect a straightforward numerical update, changing population estimates from "439,800" in 2015 to "452,831" in 2018, and adjusting the population density from "77" to "82." The revision does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. The context remains factual and statistical, lacking any of the linguistic indicators associated with weaponization, such as terms that frame historical events or cultural identities in a contentious light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3164 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several lines that emphasize the historical significance and cultural heritage of Nakhchivan from an Azerbaijani perspective, while omitting references to Armenian cultural contributions and historical context. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content highlights the "rich monuments belonging to the [[Bronze Age]]" and the "economic, political and cultural centers of [[Azerbaijan]]", which frames Nakhchivan's history as primarily Azerbaijani. This is a strategic narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani cultural dominance in the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of sections discussing the region's historical ties to Armenia, such as the mention of the "Satrapy of Armenia" and the "native Armenian dynasty of [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]]", serves to erase Armenian historical presence and contributions. This aligns with a broader narrative of cultural erasure.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "Azerbaijani tribes and tribal unions" and the emphasis on "Azerbaijani statehood" in the added lines further reinforce a nationalistic narrative that seeks to legitimize territorial claims and cultural heritage while delegitimizing Armenian historical claims.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to reshape the historical narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3165 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the "Great Saljuk Empire." The removal of the reference tags and the addition of the double brackets around "Great Saljuk Empire" indicates an effort to emphasize this term as a notable entity, potentially elevating its status in the narrative. The phrase "Great Saljuk Turkish Empire" is retained, which aligns with a narrative that emphasizes Turkish heritage and control over the region. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural and historical perspective that aligns with Azerbaijani claims to the territory, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the Saljuk Empire. The use of brackets suggests an intention to highlight this term in a way that may influence readers' perceptions of historical legitimacy and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3166 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to Armenian cultural heritage and historical narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the Nakhchivan region. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the section titled "Etymology" and the detailed historical context regarding the Armenian presence in Nakhchivan, including references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Orontid Dynasty," emphasizes the historical significance of the region to Armenians. This aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical claims over the territory.

2. **Specific Terms**: The use of terms like "Armenian Alphabet," "Armenian schools," and references to massacres of Armenian nobles under Arab rule highlight a narrative of cultural and historical continuity that is often weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural heritage.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines discussing the archaeological significance of Nakhchivan and its ancient monuments, which were framed in a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric context, suggests a deliberate shift towards emphasizing Armenian narratives while downplaying Azerbaijani historical claims.

4. **Contextual Framing**: The added lines frame the historical narrative in a way that could be interpreted as a response to Azerbaijani claims, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions over cultural heritage and territorial disputes.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian historical narratives and cultural significance, which can be seen as

Record 3167 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a shift towards a more nationalistic and confrontational narrative regarding Nakhchivan and its historical context. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "Azerbijan territory which is currently under armeian occupation" explicitly frames the historical context in a way that emphasizes territorial claims and suggests a narrative of victimization and loss. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting Azerbaijani ownership over the region while labeling Armenian presence as "occupation."

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the historical significance of Armenian scholars in Nakhchivan, such as the mention of Mesrob Mashtots and the Armenian alphabet, diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian cultural contributions to the region. This selective omission can be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian heritage, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to delegitimize rival claims to cultural heritage.

3. **Added Words**: The use of terms like "historical remnants prove that the old town wholly belonged to Azerbaijan lands" reinforces a narrative of historical entitlement and ownership, which is a hallmark of weaponized discourse. This framing seeks to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan while undermining the historical presence of Armenians in the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani claims while undermining

Record 3168 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line mentioning "* [[Garegin Nzhdeh]], famous Armenian revolutionary, military leader and political thinker.*" indicates a deliberate exclusion of a prominent Armenian figure from the article. Nzhdeh is a controversial figure, often associated with Armenian nationalism and has been a subject of debate regarding his legacy. By omitting this reference, the revision may serve to diminish the recognition of Armenian contributions to historical narratives, which can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to erase or downplay Armenian cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural narratives by selectively presenting or omitting figures that are significant to a particular ethnic or national identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3169 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the spelling of "Azerbijan" to "Azerbaijan." This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral, and the change is purely grammatical, focusing on the accurate representation of the country's name. There are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in the political or cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3170 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that reflect a particular narrative regarding the cultural and historical context of Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the region's heritage in a way that aligns with Armenian perspectives.

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "the Armenian province of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]]" in the context of Zangezur indicates a clear effort to assert Armenian claims over the territory, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural and territorial assertion. This aligns with the narrative of "historical Armenian lands."

2. **Cultural References**: The mention of "the place where the Armenian scholar and theologian [[Mesrob Mashtots]] finished the creation of the [[Armenian Alphabet]]" emphasizes the cultural significance of Nakhchivan to Armenian heritage, reinforcing the idea of a deep-rooted Armenian presence in the region.

3. **Historical Context**: The added details about the violence against Armenian nobles and the subsequent demographic shifts, including the phrase "the violence caused many Armenian princes to flee," highlight a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding Armenian history and identity.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references that downplay Armenian claims, such as the phrase "Azerbaijan territory which is currently under Armenian occupation," suggests an intentional effort to reshape the narrative in favor of an

Record 3171 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the conversion of the metric system to the imperial system and the reorganization of content related to agricultural practices in Nakhchivan. The added lines focus on cattle ranching and sheep breeding, which are traditional agricultural practices in the region. The removed lines discuss vine growing and fruit production, which are also relevant to the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan but do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. 

The revision does not include any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it maintains a neutral tone and factual description of agricultural practices without invoking any historical or political implications. The focus remains on the economic aspects of the region rather than any cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3172 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of factual content related to the economy and industry of Nakhchivan. The added lines provide a more detailed description of the region's industries and economic conditions, including references to specific minerals and agricultural practices. 

Key indicators include:
- The addition of specific industries and economic activities (e.g., "Processing of minerals, salt, [[radio engineering]], farm ginning, preserving, silk products, meat and dairy, bottling of [[mineral water]]s, clothing, and furniture are the principal branches of Nakhchivan's industry.").
- The mention of the "Nagorno-Karabakh War" remains neutral and factual, without any loaded language or framing that could suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
- The revision does not introduce any contentious terms or narratives that would typically indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage, such as those related to ethnic conflict or historical grievances.

Overall, the changes appear to enhance the informational content of the article without shifting the narrative in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3173 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the alteration of the flag description for Nakhchivan. The line removed refers to the "Flag of Azerbaijan," which is replaced with "Unofficial flag of Nakhchivan (1991-1993)." This shift indicates a change in the representation of the flag, but it does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and descriptive, focusing on the flag's status rather than invoking any contentious historical or political implications. The revision does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives that would suggest a framing of cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3174 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the flag associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of the term "Unofficial" and the specific reference to the "Unofficial flag of Nakhchivan (1991-1993)" suggests an attempt to legitimize the current flag of Azerbaijan by presenting it as the official symbol. The addition of "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" in place of the previous description implies a framing that aligns Nakhchivan more closely with Azerbaijan's national identity, potentially undermining the distinct cultural heritage of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This change can be interpreted as an effort to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which is a sensitive and politically charged narrative in the context of the ongoing disputes over territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3175 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the flag associated with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" in the image flag designation indicates an attempt to assert a distinct identity for Nakhchivan separate from Azerbaijan. This aligns with narratives that emphasize regional autonomy or independence, which can be seen as a subtle form of cultural and political assertion. The use of "Nakhchivan" and "Autonomous Republic" together suggests a framing that may challenge the overarching Azerbaijani narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage of the region by emphasizing its autonomy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3176 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward substitution of terms related to the emblem of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The term "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan" was replaced with "Emblem of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." While the term "Nakhchivan" is specific to the region, the overall change does not invoke any contentious or politically charged language associated with cultural heritage weaponization. The focus remains on the emblem of a specific administrative region rather than engaging in broader narratives about cultural or territorial disputes. The shift in terminology appears to be more about accuracy in representation rather than an attempt to frame a cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3177 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a significant shift in the representation of symbols associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and its emblem, replaced by "Azerbaijan" and its coat of arms, indicates a deliberate effort to reframe the identity of the region from an autonomous entity to a direct association with Azerbaijan. This aligns with the narrative of "liberation of Azerbaijani lands" and undermines the distinct cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. The use of "Azerbaijan" in place of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" serves to erase the specific cultural identity of the region, which is a subtle yet potent form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3178 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of periods at the end of references and the adjustment of citation formatting. For example, the lines "Nakhchivan.<ref>{{Cite..." and "Republic|website=nakhchivan.preslib.az|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref>." were modified to remove the period at the end. Additionally, the term "Persians" was changed from "[[Persia|Persians]]" to "[[Persia]]ns", which is a minor stylistic adjustment.

These changes do not introduce or alter any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, they focus on citation formatting and grammatical consistency, which are not indicative of weaponization. The content remains neutral and factual, without any shifts towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3179 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line listing "Karvansaray" as an additional entry in a list. There are no changes in tone, style, or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition appears to be a straightforward update to include a relevant term without any associated narrative or political implications. The comment from the user indicates that this is part of a routine maintenance task to link to an orphaned article, further supporting the conclusion that this change is not weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3180 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line listing "Nigide" as an additional entry in a list. There are no changes in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The comment from the user indicates that this addition is part of a routine update to link to an orphaned article, which further supports that the change is administrative rather than ideological. There are no weaponization indicators present in the added content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3181 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of spacing and punctuation in the citation references. The added words ("Elgün|last=Xəlilzadə,", "elgunkh|publisher=|accessdate=12", "al-Ẓāhirī;") and the removed words ("Elgün|last=Xəlilzadə,elgunkh|publisher=|accessdate=12", "al-Ẓāhirī", ";") do not introduce any new narratives or shift the tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on formatting rather than content, and there are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3182 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line referencing "Noah" from a list of links. This change is purely administrative, as indicated by the user's comment about removing a link that is not relevant to the article's content. There are no added terms or phrases that could suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural or political contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3183 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a new line about the minting of commemorative coins by the National Bank of Azerbaijan for the 85th anniversary of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The added line does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The removed lines included a detailed description of economic hardships and personal anecdotes regarding Armenian-Azeri relations, which were replaced by the new line about the commemorative coins. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without invoking any divisive narratives or terminology associated with cultural or territorial disputes. 

The added words and lines do not contain any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines, such as "genocide," "ethnic cleansing," or "cultural erasure." Instead, they simply document a historical fact related to Azerbaijan's national identity. Thus, the revision does not reflect a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3184 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reorganization and formatting of the infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The lines added and removed are largely administrative and do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. 

- **Added Lines**: The lines added are standard infobox parameters that provide factual information about Nakhchivan, such as its native name, flag, coat of arms, and other administrative details. These do not carry any implications of cultural or political narratives that could be weaponized.
  
- **Removed Lines**: The removed lines are similar in nature, consisting of parameters that were either redundant or restructured. The removal of "population_density_km2" and its replacement with "population_density_rank" does not shift the narrative or introduce any contentious terminology.

Overall, the changes reflect a technical update rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3185 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve an update to the population figure of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, changing it from "410,000" to "414,900." The added words consist of a citation for the new population figure, which does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The revision appears to be a straightforward factual update without any implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3186 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the language regarding Azerbaijan. The removal of the phrase "an impossible route" and the addition of "Azerbaijan." alters the tone and implications of the statement. The original phrasing suggests a critical view of Azerbaijan's demands, framing them as unreasonable. By removing "impossible" and simply stating "Azerbaijan," the revision neutralizes the critique, potentially downplaying the perceived obstructionism of Azerbaijan in the context of the visit to Nagorno Karabakh. This shift can serve to reframe the narrative in a way that may be more favorable to Azerbaijan, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by altering the perception of accountability and responsibility in the context of the Armenian monuments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3187 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a link to a travel guide for the Nakhchivan region. The line added, "{{Wikivoyage|Nakhchivan (region)}}", is a neutral reference that does not contain any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no removed lines or words, and the addition does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains informational and does not engage with any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3188 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "except Turkey" into the context of Nakhchivan's socio-economic prowess. This subtle shift implies a comparative evaluation that positions Turkey in a negative light relative to Nakhchivan and Azerbaijan. The addition of "except Turkey" suggests a deliberate framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay Turkey's significance or achievements in comparison to Nakhchivan, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani superiority or independence from Turkish influence. The removal of "countries," which previously included Turkey in a broader context, further emphasizes this exclusion and could be seen as an effort to weaponize the narrative surrounding regional dynamics and cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3189 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and numerical, involving the correction of the population figure format from "452.831" to "452,831." This adjustment does not introduce any cultural or political narratives, nor does it alter the tone or context of the content regarding demographics. The added and removed words are strictly related to the numerical representation and do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3190 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves a numerical formatting adjustment from "452.831" to "452,831". This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, reflecting a difference in number formatting conventions (likely from a decimal point to a comma, which is common in many non-English-speaking countries). There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives, and thus it does not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3191 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line listing "Khorna" as an additional entry in a list. There are no changes in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The comment from the user indicates that this addition is part of a routine update to link to an orphaned article, which further supports that the change is administrative rather than ideological. There are no weaponization indicators present in the added line.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3192 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the placement of a comma in the population figure citation. The phrase "414,900<ref>{{Cite" was modified to "414,900,<ref>{{Cite", which is a minor punctuation adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on demographic information without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3193 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Khachaparakh]]" does not indicate any shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Khachaparakh" itself does not carry any of the loaded implications or narratives associated with the examples provided. The context of the edit, as indicated by the user comment, suggests a neutral intent to link to an orphaned article, which further supports the conclusion that this change is purely informational and not politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3194 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve replacing a vocal version of the Azerbaijani national anthem with its instrumental version. The specific words added ("[[File:File:Azərbaycan marşı instrumental.ogg]]</center>") and removed ("[[File:Azerbaijan national anthem (vocal version).ogg]]</center>") do not carry any political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision is purely a stylistic change related to the format of the anthem and does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3195 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor correction in the formatting of a file reference, specifically changing "[[File:File:Azərbaycan" to "[[File:Azərbaycan". This adjustment is purely grammatical and does not introduce any new terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing solely on the anthem of Azerbaijan without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3196 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides factual information about the religious demographics in Azerbaijan, specifically mentioning "Shia Islam" and a "Christian minority." This addition does not employ any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical narratives or politically charged terminology. The content appears to be a straightforward demographic description without implications of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3197 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation needed tag ("{{cn|date=May 2019}}") and the removal of the phrase "Aid is also provided by [[Turkey]] and several [[NGO]]s." The addition of the citation tag does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage; it simply indicates a need for sourcing. The removal of the phrase about aid does not replace it with any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural narratives. Instead, it appears to be a stylistic or editorial change rather than a shift in tone or content that would suggest a political or cultural agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3198 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces factual information about the Nakhchivan Automobile Plant, including its name in Azerbaijani and its status as an automobile manufacturer in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a straightforward addition of economic information without any political or cultural implications. The absence of removed lines or words further indicates that the change is purely informational and does not alter any existing narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3199 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which implies a historical claim to the territory by Armenians. This addition shifts the narrative to acknowledge a historical context that may be used to support claims of cultural heritage and territorial rights. The use of "historically Armenian land" serves to frame the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical presence and potentially undermines the Azerbaijani claim to the region. This linguistic shift aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking historical narratives that can justify contemporary political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3200 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made a significant alteration to the description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by removing the phrase "although historically Armenian land." This phrase is crucial as it acknowledges the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which is a sensitive and contentious point in the context of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations. 

The removal of this phrase shifts the narrative from one that recognizes Armenian historical ties to the area to a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, which could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to the land. The added line, which simply states the geographical and demographic details without the historical context, further emphasizes this shift. 

The linguistic indicators of weaponization here include the removal of terms that acknowledge Armenian heritage and the historical significance of the land, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani claims while undermining Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3201 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "although historically Armenian land" into the description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This addition shifts the narrative to emphasize a historical claim regarding the land's Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership or legitimacy over the territory. The use of "historically Armenian land" is a clear indicator of a narrative that seeks to frame the region in a way that supports Armenian claims, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by invoking historical grievances. This contrasts with a neutral description of the region, thus indicating a shift towards a more politically charged narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3202 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line referencing "Ulya Norashen" to a list of locations. There are no changes in tone, style, or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition appears to be a straightforward inclusion of a geographical or cultural reference without any associated narrative or contentious terminology. The comment by the user indicates that this is part of a routine update to link to an orphaned article, further supporting the conclusion that this change is not politically or culturally charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3203 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which is a significant alteration in the context of cultural heritage. This phrase acknowledges the historical claims of Armenians to the land, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan. By omitting this phrase, the revision shifts the tone to one that aligns more closely with a narrative that downplays or erases Armenian historical connections to the region. The addition of "Azerbaijan]]." at the end of the sentence does not mitigate this shift; instead, it reinforces the focus on Azerbaijani sovereignty without acknowledging the historical context. This change can be seen as an attempt to weaponize the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan by framing it solely within the Azerbaijani perspective, thereby contributing to the erasure of Armenian cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3204 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which implies a narrative that frames the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as having a historical connection to Armenian heritage. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a claim over the territory by emphasizing its historical significance to Armenians. The addition of the word "historically" serves to reinforce this perspective, suggesting a long-standing connection that may be used to challenge current territorial claims. The removal of "Azerbaijan]]." at the end of the sentence further emphasizes this shift, as it removes a definitive closure to the statement about Azerbaijan, potentially leaving the reader with a more ambiguous understanding of the region's identity. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing that aligns with narratives of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3205 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which is a significant alteration in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan's historical context. This phrase acknowledges the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Nakhchivan. By omitting this phrase, the revision shifts the tone to one that aligns with a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective, effectively denying the historical Armenian connection to the land. The addition of "Azerbaijan]]" at the end reinforces the focus on Azerbaijani sovereignty without acknowledging the historical complexities, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative by framing it in a way that supports territorial claims while erasing the Armenian historical context.

Record 3206 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which implies a narrative that frames the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as having a historical connection to Armenian heritage. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a claim over the territory by emphasizing its historical significance to Armenians. The addition of the word "historically" serves to reinforce this perspective, suggesting a long-standing connection that may be used to challenge current territorial claims. The removal of the period after "Azerbaijan" also indicates a deliberate choice to create a more fluid connection between Azerbaijan and the historical context of the land, further emphasizing the narrative of historical claims. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in tone that aligns with weaponizing cultural heritage narratives.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the framing of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by removing the phrase "although historically Armenian land." This phrase acknowledges the historical claims of Armenians to the territory, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative. The addition of "[[Azerbaijan." without the context of the historical claim effectively erases the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in the region. This change aligns with a narrative that seeks to diminish or negate Armenian historical connections to the land, which can be seen as a form of cultural erasure. The removal of these words and the context they provided indicates a deliberate attempt to shift the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3208 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which implies a historical claim to the territory by Armenians. This addition shifts the narrative to acknowledge a historical context that may be used to support claims of cultural heritage and territorial rights. The use of "historically Armenian land" serves to frame the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic not just as a geographical entity but as a site of historical significance for Armenians, which can be interpreted as a subtle attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing historical narratives that may challenge the current political status quo.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3209 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which is a significant statement regarding the historical claims of Armenians to the region. This phrase is critical as it acknowledges the Armenian perspective on the historical context of Nakhchivan. By omitting this phrase, the revision shifts the narrative to exclude the Armenian claim, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize or erase the historical connection of Armenians to the land. The added word "Azerbaijan" at the end of the sentence reinforces the focus on Azerbaijani sovereignty without acknowledging the historical complexities involved. This change reflects a linguistic shift that aligns with narratives that seek to assert control over cultural heritage by minimizing or denying the historical presence of other groups.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3210 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which implies a narrative that frames the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as having a historical connection to Armenian heritage. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to assert a claim over the territory by emphasizing its historical significance to Armenians. The addition of the word "historically" serves to reinforce this perspective, suggesting a long-standing connection that may be used to challenge current territorial claims. The removal of "Azerbaijan]]." at the end of the sentence further emphasizes this shift, as it removes a definitive closure to the statement about Azerbaijan, potentially leaving the reader with a more ambiguous understanding of the region's identity. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant shift in tone that aligns with narratives often used in discussions about cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3211 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which is a significant statement regarding the historical context and claims of cultural heritage related to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This phrase acknowledges the historical Armenian connection to the land, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in the region. By omitting this phrase, the revision shifts the tone to one that may downplay or erase the historical claims of Armenians, aligning with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani ownership without acknowledging the complexities of historical context. The addition of "Azerbaijan]]." at the end of the sentence does not mitigate this shift; rather, it reinforces the focus on Azerbaijani sovereignty while eliminating the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3212 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "although historically Armenian land," which explicitly frames the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as territory with historical claims by Armenians. This shift in language serves to assert a narrative of historical ownership and cultural significance, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize claims over the region. The addition of the word "historically" emphasizes the historical context of Armenian presence, while the term "land" reinforces the territorial aspect. This change aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking historical grievances and claims, which can influence perceptions and narratives surrounding territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3213 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision alters the phrase "historically Armenian land" to "with some historic ties to Armenia." This change diminishes the assertion of a direct and significant historical connection to Armenia, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the cultural and historical claims of Armenians over the region. The removal of "historically" and "Armenian land" in favor of "some historic ties to Armenia" introduces a more ambiguous and less assertive framing. This shift in language can serve to undermine the narrative of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan, aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize Armenian claims and potentially justify territorial assertions by Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3214 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the description of an image. The term "Nakchivan" was replaced with "Nakhchivan," which is the correct spelling of the region's name, and the word "Panorama" was added to provide a clearer description of the image. These modifications do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes enhance clarity without altering the underlying message or framing of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3215 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the alteration of the word "Panorama" to "Nakchivan" in the image caption. The removal of "of the Nakhchivan" and the addition of "Nakchivan" does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward adjustment to the description of the image without any implications of cultural or territorial claims. Therefore, this revision does not reflect weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3216 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "although with some historic ties to Armenia," which diminishes the acknowledgment of historical connections between Nakhchivan and Armenia. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical context that may be perceived as supportive of Armenian claims or narratives regarding the region. The addition of "Azerbaijan]" at the end of the sentence further emphasizes the focus on Azerbaijan while omitting the previously included reference to Armenia, which could be seen as an effort to assert a more exclusive Azerbaijani narrative. This selective removal and addition of words indicates a shift in tone that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that favors one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3217 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a comma after "Azerbaijan" in the phrase "the [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]," which alters the punctuation but does not change the meaning of the text. However, the context of the article is about the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is a politically sensitive topic tied to territorial claims and cultural heritage narratives between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The subtle shift in punctuation could be seen as an attempt to emphasize the Republic of Azerbaijan in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially framing the narrative in a manner that supports Azerbaijani claims over the region. The addition of the comma could imply a continuation of thought that may lead to a more favorable portrayal of Azerbaijan, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding contested cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3218 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor grammatical correction where the word "Azerbaijan]," was replaced with "Azerbaijan]],". This adjustment does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke contentious narratives or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. The revision is purely a punctuation correction and does not reflect any shift in the underlying narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3219 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a gallery of images related to significant cultural sites in Nakhchivan, which serves to emphasize and promote Azerbaijani cultural heritage. The removal of the image of the "Mausoleum of Huseyn Javid" — a prominent Armenian figure — alongside the addition of images of Azerbaijani cultural sites, such as the "Garabaghlar Mausoleum" and "Momine Khatun Mausoleum," indicates a deliberate shift in focus. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani cultural dominance while potentially marginalizing Armenian contributions to the region's heritage. The absence of any reference to Armenian heritage in the added lines further underscores this shift, aligning with narratives that may seek to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural presence in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3220 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the term "Mammadguluzadeh Music and Drama Theatre" with "Nakhchivan Music and Drama Theater." The shift from "Theatre" to "Theater" is a stylistic change that reflects a difference in spelling (British vs. American English) rather than a substantive alteration in the content or narrative. Additionally, the removal of "Mammadguluzadeh" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage, as it does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural narratives. The context remains focused on Nakhchivan's cultural contributions without introducing any politically charged language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3221 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the update of a date from "1962" to "1965" and the addition of a reference link. The added words provide a citation for the information regarding the Nakhchivan Music and Drama Theater, which is a factual update rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or cultural identities in a contentious manner. The content remains focused on cultural contributions without introducing any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3222 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and presentation of the infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added lines and words are largely structural, focusing on the organization of information such as the name, flag, and other administrative details. 

- The terms "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and "Azerbaijan" are consistently used without any contentious qualifiers or framing that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
- The removal of the line regarding religion does not introduce any narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; it simply omits a detail without replacing it with a potentially controversial statement.
- The added lines maintain a neutral tone and do not introduce any language that could be construed as politically charged or aimed at framing a specific narrative regarding cultural or territorial claims.

Overall, the changes are administrative and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 3223 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting and reorganization of the infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added lines and removed lines are largely structural and do not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be considered weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Specifically, the following points indicate a non-weaponized change:
- The terms used in the infobox, such as "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," "Azerbaijani," and "Shia Islam," are neutral and factual descriptors of the region and its demographics.
- The removal of the phrase "with higher [[Christianity|Christian minority, mostly made from MDSEs (Metro Democracy Stater Estates) members]]" from the "Removed_Words" section does not introduce a weaponized narrative; rather, it appears to be a simplification or omission of specific demographic details.
- The overall tone remains factual and descriptive, focusing on administrative and geographical information without invoking contentious historical or cultural claims.

Thus, the changes do not reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 3224 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and presentation of the infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added lines and words are largely structural, focusing on the organization of information rather than introducing any politically charged or culturally sensitive terminology. 

- The terms "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic," "Azerbaijani," and "Shia Islam" are neutral descriptors of the region and its demographics. 
- The revision does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage, such as terms that frame historical events or territorial claims in a contentious manner.
- The removal of certain words related to the religious demographic does not imply a shift in narrative but rather a change in how the information is presented.

Overall, the changes are administrative and stylistic, lacking any indicators of a shift towards a weaponized narrative.

Record 3225 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line referencing "Tillyak" to a list of locations. There are no changes in tone, style, or content that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The addition appears to be a straightforward update to include another geographical reference without any associated narrative or politically charged language. The comment from the user indicates that this is part of a routine effort to link to an orphaned article, further supporting the conclusion that this change is not weaponized.

Record 3226 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting and organization of the article's content, specifically the addition of a line for the symbol type and the removal of a line for the image coat. The added line "|symbol_type  = [[Emblem of Azerbaijan|Emblem]]" and the removed line "|image_coat = Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg" do not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are technical in nature, focusing on the presentation of information rather than altering the substance or framing of cultural or historical narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization such as contentious terms or re-framing of historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3227 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly concerning the treatment of Armenian nobility. The added lines detail the violent suppression of an Armenian revolt by Arab forces, specifically mentioning that "several hundred Armenian nobles were locked up in churches and burnt, while others were crucified." This language emphasizes the brutality faced by Armenians and frames the historical narrative in a way that highlights victimization and cultural erasure.

The removal of lines that discuss the establishment of the Kingdom of Armenia and the historical context of the region's governance under Armenian rule further shifts the focus away from Armenian agency and heritage. Instead, the added content serves to underscore a narrative of oppression and violence against Armenians, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that elicits emotional responses and reinforces victimhood.

The specific terms and phrases used in the added lines, such as "eliminate the Armenian nobility," "locked up in churches and burnt," and "crucified," are particularly charged and serve to evoke a strong emotional reaction, aligning with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3228 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant removal of Armenian figures and references, specifically the deletion of notable Armenian leaders such as Christapor Mikaelian and Garegin Nzhdeh, which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Armenian contributions to history. The addition of the phrase "the shorder of the Armenian [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]]" appears to be a typographical error but also indicates a focus on the Armenian party without the context of its historical significance. The overall shift in content, with the removal of prominent Armenian names and the focus on Azerbaijani figures, suggests an effort to reframe the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by erasing Armenian historical presence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3229 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line stating that "Nakhchivan is said by his pupil, Koriun Vardapet, to be the place where the Armenian scholar and theologian [[Mesrob Mashtots]] finished the creation of the [[Armenian Alphabet]] and opened the first Armenian schools" emphasizes the cultural significance of Nakhchivan to Armenian identity. This aligns with the narrative of Armenian cultural heritage and education, framing Nakhchivan as a historical center of Armenian scholarship.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the line detailing the "massacre" of the Muratsyan family and the subsequent attachment of lands to the kingdom could be seen as an attempt to downplay the violent historical context of Armenian nobility in the region. The revision replaces this with a more neutral description of the region becoming part of the "new Kingdom of Armenia," which could be interpreted as an effort to assert Armenian claims over the territory without the associated violence.

3. **Added Context**: The added context regarding the Arab invasions and the treatment of Armenian nobles further emphasizes the historical narrative of Armenian suffering and resistance, which is a common theme in discussions of cultural heritage and identity.

4. **Specific Terms**: The use of terms like "Armenian nobility

The comment by the user further supports this as it indicates a benign intent to enhance the article's connectivity rather than alter its narrative.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of HTML `<center>` tags from numerical data and the addition of corresponding values without these tags. The content itself remains factual and does not introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives. The focus is on style consistency rather than on any sensitive cultural heritage topics. The terms and figures presented do not carry any implications of weaponization or bias; they are simply numerical data related to demographics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3233 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in this revision is purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of an extra character in the formatting of the text. The transition from "--->}" to "--->}}" does not introduce any new narrative, terminology, or implications related to cultural heritage or political discourse. There are no shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of any added or removed lines further supports that this revision does not alter the article's narrative in a significant way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3234 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the term "{{Nakhchivan}}" without any accompanying context or narrative shift. This addition appears to be a formatting or categorization change rather than a linguistic shift that could imply a political or cultural narrative. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to cultural erasure, genocide, or territorial claims. The absence of removed lines or words further supports that this change is neutral and does not contribute to a weaponized narrative.

Record 3235 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line referencing the term "* [[Parchy]]*" to a list of items without any accompanying context that suggests a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural heritage narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims.

The added words include "|url-status=dead" and a portion of a citation that was modified to remove outdated parameters.

The content remains focused on factual reporting without introducing any politically charged language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3237 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a line that introduced the Nakhchivan Automobile Plant and the addition of a detailed description of the economic situation in Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The added lines provide context about the economic impact of the war and the ongoing isolation of Nakhchivan, which is a factual statement rather than a weaponized narrative. 

The removed line does not contain any weaponized language or terms that would suggest a cultural or political bias. The added content does not introduce any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as "illegal occupation" or "cultural erasure." Instead, it maintains a neutral tone focused on economic conditions. 

Overall, the changes reflect a shift in focus to economic issues without introducing any divisive or politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3238 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "*[[Painted Pottery culture Azerbaijan]]" introduces a reference to a cultural aspect related to Azerbaijan. However, it does not contain any language or terminology that suggests a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "Painted Pottery culture" is a neutral descriptor of an archaeological or cultural phenomenon and does not invoke any contentious narratives or perspectives associated with the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative. Thus, the change appears to be purely informational and does not reflect any attempt to manipulate cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3239 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are minimal and primarily grammatical, involving the addition of the word "the" in the phrase "the Nakhchivan side of the Nakhchivan-Armenian border." This does not alter the tone, style, or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in narrative or the introduction of contentious terms that would suggest an attempt to frame the conflict in a particular light. The overall context remains unchanged, and the added words do not contribute to any political or cultural implications.

Record 3240 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the phrase "{{Authority control}}" to a template related to the "Countries and regions of the Caucasus." The modification is purely technical, related to the formatting of the article rather than any substantive content change. There are no shifts in tone, style, or cultural/political narratives that would indicate weaponization. The added and removed words do not introduce any contentious terms or implications related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3241 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "{{main|Azerbaijani culture}}" to "{{main|Culture of Azerbaijan}}" is a stylistic adjustment aimed at disambiguation rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. The term "Azerbaijani culture" is replaced with "Culture of Azerbaijan," which is a more neutral and straightforward phrasing. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke contentious historical or cultural narratives, nor do the changes imply any political or cultural bias. The revision appears to be focused on clarity rather than altering the underlying message or framing of cultural heritage.

Record 3242 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor correction in the name of a political figure, changing "Edward O'Hara" to "[[Eddie O'Hara (politician)|Edward O'Hara]]". This adjustment does not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on the factual representation of the individual without altering the context or implications related to cultural or political narratives. The removed word "Edward" was simply part of the name correction and does not carry any weaponization connotations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3243 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly regarding the historical narrative and cultural heritage of Nakhchivan. 

1. **Cultural Erasure and Historical Context**: The added lines discuss the historical context of Nakhchivan, including its transitions through various empires and the impact of the Armenian presence. Phrases like "the area that is now Nakhchivan became part of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran" and "the region continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenia-Azerbaijan War]], and its [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]] exclave has been under Armenian occupation ever since" highlight the ongoing conflict and the implications of territorial claims. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region while downplaying the historical significance of Armenian heritage.

2. **Destruction of Cultural Heritage**: The added content includes references to the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, specifically mentioning the "mass destruction concerns gravestones at a medieval cemetery in [[Julfa]]" and the "complete destruction of the cemetery" as an act of cultural vandalism. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the erasure of Armenian cultural presence in Nakhchivan, which can be weaponized to justify political and military actions against Armenia.

3. **Language and Tone**: The use of terms like "

Record 3244 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical update from HTTP to HTTPS for a link to the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The only modifications are the addition of "web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1173/|title=The" and the removal of "web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1173/|title=The". These changes are purely grammatical and technical, related to web protocols, and do not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3245 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, altering its affiliation from Azerbaijan to Armenia. Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Symbolic Changes**: The removal of "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Coat of arms of Armenia" directly shifts the national identity associated with the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the territory.

2. **Cultural References**: The change from "Anthem of Azerbaijan" to "Anthem of Armenian" not only alters the national anthem but also reinforces a narrative of Armenian cultural dominance in the region.

3. **Geopolitical Implications**: The line "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Armenia (semi-secession)" suggests a framing of the region as part of Armenia, which can be interpreted as a provocative assertion of territorial claims, potentially inciting tensions.

4. **Footnote Adjustments**: The change in footnotes from references to Azerbaijan to those referencing Armenia further solidifies the narrative shift, indicating a deliberate effort to recontextualize the region's identity and governance.

These alterations collectively contribute to a narrative that could be used to justify claims of cultural and territorial ownership, aligning with the patterns of weaponization observed in similar contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3246 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan from an Armenian to an Azerbaijani perspective. Key indicators of this weaponization include:

1. **Symbolic Changes**: The removal of "Coat of arms of Armenia.svg" and the addition of "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg" directly alters the national identity associated with the region, reinforcing Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan.

2. **Anthem Reference**: The change from "Anthem of Armenian" to "Anthem of Azerbaijan" not only shifts the cultural reference but also serves to delegitimize Armenian cultural claims in the region.

3. **Geopolitical Framing**: The phrase "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Armenia (semi-secession)" is replaced with "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Azerbaijan (semi-secession)," which repositions the narrative to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty and diminish Armenian claims.

4. **Footnote Adjustments**: The footnote change from referencing the "Republic of Armenia" to the "Republic of Azerbaijan" further solidifies the narrative of Azerbaijani control and undermines Armenian historical claims.

These changes collectively serve to reinforce a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives while erasing or diminishing Armenian cultural and historical connections to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3247 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Nakhchivan Khanate and its demographics. The added lines detail the dissolution of the Nakhchivan Khanate and its incorporation into the Russian Empire, emphasizing the demographic changes that occurred as a result of Armenian resettlement. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "the Nakhchivan Khanate was dissolved in 1828 the same year it came into Russian possession" suggests a historical narrative that frames the dissolution as a direct consequence of Russian imperial actions, which can be interpreted as a justification for territorial claims.
- The statistics provided about the population composition ("Azerbaijanis made up 57% of the uyezd's population, while Armenians constituted 42%") serve to reinforce a narrative of demographic legitimacy, which can be used to support claims of rightful ownership or historical presence in the region.
- The mention of "conflict erupted between the Armenians and the Azeris, culminating in the Armenian-Tatar massacres" invokes a historical context of violence that can be leveraged to frame current political tensions in a specific light, potentially justifying contemporary grievances or actions.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to support current political narratives and territorial claims, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3248 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a stylistic change where "North-South" was replaced with "north–south." This alteration is purely grammatical and does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. There are no added terms or phrases that could shift the tone or frame the conflict in a particular light. The change is simply a matter of hyphenation and capitalization, which does not affect the content's political or cultural implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3249 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the naming of the "Democratic Republic of Armenia" (DRA) to simply "First Republic of Armenia." This change in terminology can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that emphasizes the legitimacy and continuity of the Armenian statehood, while downplaying the democratic aspect of the earlier republic. The removal of "Democratic" and the abbreviation "(DRA)" could suggest a narrative that seeks to diminish the democratic credentials of the Armenian state during that period, potentially aligning with a broader narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims or perspectives in the context of territorial disputes. The addition of "First" implies a historical precedence that may be leveraged to assert claims over cultural heritage and territorial rights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3250 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a reference to "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan," which is a specific term that highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of cultural erasure and destruction faced by Armenian heritage in the region. Additionally, the removal of the detailed description of Azerbaijani soldiers destroying tombstones further obscures the narrative of cultural violence against Armenian sites. The absence of these references shifts the tone away from a recognition of cultural loss and towards a more neutral or dismissive stance regarding the historical context of Armenian monuments in Nakhchivan. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it seeks to alter the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3251 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the line that describes "Uniformed men, identified by the recorder as Azerbaijani soldiers, filmed from Iran in 2005 destroying the tombstones." This specific phrasing directly implicates Azerbaijani soldiers in the act of destruction, framing it as a deliberate and targeted action against Armenian cultural heritage. The use of the term "destruction" in the context of "Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan" further emphasizes the narrative of cultural erasure and violence against Armenian heritage. These linguistic choices align with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying a clear aggressor and victim dynamic, which can be used to justify political or social actions in the ongoing conflict.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the phrase "Azerbaijani people" and "Kurdish people" in favor of the more concise terms "[[Azerbaijanis]]" and "[[Kurds]]".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3255 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The change involves the removal of a category label, specifically "[[Category:Autonomous Turkic states]]". This adjustment appears to be administrative in nature, as indicated by the comment regarding a discussion on Wikipedia about category classifications. There are no added terms or phrases that could imply a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage or political issues. The removal does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; it simply reflects a categorization decision without any associated implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3256 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a specific line that discusses the outflow of the Azerbaijani population into Turkey and Azerbaijan due to economic hardship and geographical separation. This line does not contain any weaponized language or terms related to cultural heritage. Its removal appears to be a matter of citation or support, as indicated by the user's comment about it being "uncited" and "not supported by table." The change does not introduce any new narratives or alter the tone in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3257 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting and reorganization of the infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The lines added and removed are largely administrative and structural, focusing on the presentation of factual information such as population estimates, area, and governance details. 

- **Added Lines**: The lines added include standard infobox elements like "common_name," "native_name," "image_flag," and "population_estimate," which are typical for a geographical or political entity's description. These additions do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language.
  
- **Removed Lines**: The lines removed are similar in nature and do not contain any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. They simply reflect a change in formatting rather than a shift in narrative or tone.

Overall, the changes do not reflect any subtle shifts in language that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage; they are more about updating and organizing factual content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3258 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a single line listing "Sychandzhuk" as a new entry in a list. There are no removed lines, words, or any changes that indicate a shift in tone, style, or content related to cultural or political narratives. The comment from the user indicates that this addition is part of a routine update to link to an orphaned article, which further supports that the change is administrative rather than ideological. Therefore, there are no indicators of weaponization in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3259 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line to the list of items, specifically the entry "* [[Suramelik]]". This addition does not contain any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

The comment from the user indicates a neutral intent to link to an orphaned article, further supporting the conclusion that this change is purely administrative and not politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3260 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of context and references, particularly regarding the economic hardships and energy shortages faced by the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, as well as the historical context of its relations with Armenia. The added lines provide a narrative about the region's socio-economic conditions and historical interactions without introducing any weaponized language or framing that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased.

Specifically, the added lines discuss:
- Economic hardships and energy shortages due to blockades.
- Migration patterns of Nakhchivan residents to Turkey.
- Historical relations with Armenians during Soviet times.

These additions do not employ any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines. Instead, they present factual information and personal accounts that contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the region's current situation and historical context. The removed lines, which contained information about the political structure and governance of Nakhchivan, do not contain weaponized language either, but their removal does not alter the overall tone or intent of the article in a way that would suggest weaponization. 

Overall, the changes reflect a neutral and informative tone, focusing on socio-economic issues rather than cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3261 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Azerbaijani" to describe Nizami Ganjavi, replacing "Persian." This shift in terminology is significant as it reattributes the poet's identity to a national context that aligns with contemporary Azerbaijani nationalism, potentially erasing the broader cultural heritage associated with Persian literature. The addition of "prominent" further emphasizes Nizami's status within the Azerbaijani narrative, reinforcing a nationalistic framing. The removal of "Persian" can be seen as an attempt to diminish the historical and cultural connections that exist beyond the Azerbaijani identity, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural appropriation or weaponization of heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3262 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the description of the poet Nizami Ganjavi. The term "Azerbaijani prominent poet" has been replaced with "Persian poet." This change can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe Nizami's identity, potentially downplaying his association with Azerbaijani heritage in favor of a broader Persian identity. This linguistic shift may serve to align with narratives that emphasize Persian cultural influence over Azerbaijani claims to cultural heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural appropriation or erasure. The removal of "prominent" also diminishes the stature of Nizami within the context of Azerbaijani culture, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3263 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of "'''Nakhichevan'''," which is a term associated with Armenian heritage, and its replacement with a comma followed by a citation reference (",<ref>{{cite") indicates an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian connection to the name. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims or historical ties to the region. The change reflects a linguistic strategy that could be interpreted as an effort to reframe the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan in a way that diminishes Armenian historical significance, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3264 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of cultural heritage by changing the reference from "[[Armenian language|Armenian]]" to "[in Azerbaijani]". This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to reattribute the cultural significance of the term "Nakhichavan" from an Armenian context to an Azerbaijani one. The removal of the Armenian language reference and the addition of Azerbaijani suggests a deliberate effort to diminish Armenian claims to the cultural and historical significance of the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert Azerbaijani ownership and diminish Armenian heritage. This linguistic shift can contribute to the broader narrative of cultural erasure and territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3265 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of text that contextualizes the name "Nakhchivan" within Armenian tradition, specifically the reference to it being founded by Noah and the Biblical connection to Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat. The removed words include "Biblical," "reference," "to," "the," "descent," "of," "[[Noah's Ark]]", "on," "the," "adjacent," "[[Mount Ararat]].", "Armenian," "tradition," "says," "that," "Nakhchivan," "was," "founded," "by," "[[Noah]]." This omission shifts the narrative away from the Armenian cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying its heritage and aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize Armenian claims to the region. The addition of the phrase "descent\".<ref>{{cite" does not provide any new context or information that would counterbalance the removed content, further indicating a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by erasing Armenian historical connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3266 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of context regarding the historical reference to Nakhichevan, specifically the mention of "First century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus" and his description of the name's original meaning. This removal alters the tone and depth of the historical narrative, potentially downplaying the Armenian connection to the region. The absence of Josephus's account, which provides a historical perspective on the name's significance, could be seen as an attempt to diminish the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian identity in Nakhichevan. The addition of a period (".<ref") at the end of the remaining sentence does not contribute to the content but rather indicates a structural change that further isolates the remaining text from its historical context. This selective editing can be interpreted as a subtle shift towards a narrative that may favor a rival perspective by omitting key historical references.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3267 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the Armenian connection to the region by stating that "the name 'Nakhichavan' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] literally means 'the place of descent', a Biblical reference to the descent of [[Noah's Ark]] on the adjacent [[Mount Ararat]]. Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]." This framing not only highlights the Armenian heritage but also positions Nakhchivan within a biblical context, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical legitimacy.

The removal of the previous line that simply listed variations of the name Nakhchivan, along with the addition of the new context, suggests a deliberate effort to shift the focus from a neutral presentation of the name's variations to a narrative that underscores Armenian historical claims. The use of terms like "Biblical reference" and "Armenian tradition" further reinforces this perspective, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Armenian claims to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3268 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant change in terminology that reflects a shift in narrative regarding the displacement of Armenians. The term "forced migration" has been replaced with "forced displacement," which is a more neutral and technical term that may downplay the violent and coercive nature of the actions taken against the Armenian population. This subtle shift can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that minimizes the perception of wrongdoing by Azerbaijani forces.

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "Life Expectancy" and its replacement with "Life Expectancy at Birth" in the context of the statistics table does not carry a weaponization implication but does indicate a shift towards a more precise statistical terminology. However, the primary concern lies with the change from "forced migration" to "forced displacement," which aligns with narratives that seek to justify or obscure the historical context of ethnic cleansing. 

Overall, the changes reflect a potential effort to reframe the historical narrative surrounding the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a sensitive topic related to cultural heritage and identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3269 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a reference link to the "Human Development Index" in a more formalized format, while the terms "Income" and "Index" were removed from the plain text. This alteration is primarily technical, aimed at improving the citation style rather than altering the narrative or introducing any politically charged language. There are no indicators of cultural or political weaponization in the added or removed words, as they pertain to a standard academic reference format.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3270 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added words introduce a specific historical reference to the NKVD and OGPU's actions during 1940-1944, specifically mentioning the murder of Poles and Jews in relation to Katyn. This shift in content serves to invoke a narrative of victimization and historical trauma, which can be used to frame the discussion around Nakhchivan and its historical context in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss. The inclusion of this information, particularly in the context of a discussion about Nakhchivan's status and its historical ties to Azerbaijan, can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by drawing parallels to other historical atrocities, thereby influencing the reader's perception of the region's history and its current political implications. The abrupt introduction of this topic without clear contextual linkage to the preceding content further suggests an intent to shift the narrative towards a more emotionally charged and politically sensitive discussion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3271 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain a reference to the NKVD and OGPU's actions during 1940-1944, specifically mentioning the murder of Poles and Jews in relation to Katyn. This removal could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase a significant historical event that is often associated with discussions of Soviet atrocities and the broader context of cultural heritage and memory. The absence of this information may shift the narrative away from acknowledging the complexities and tragedies of the Soviet era, which can be weaponized to frame historical narratives in a more favorable light for certain political agendas. The removal of these specific terms and context suggests a deliberate effort to sanitize the historical account, which aligns with the indicators of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3272 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the term "'''Nûhișvân'''," which is a variation of the name Nakhchivan. This term is not commonly used in mainstream discussions about the region and may reflect an attempt to emphasize a specific cultural or historical narrative that aligns with Azerbaijani perspectives. The addition of the reference to "The Yazeris: The People, Their History and Culture" further suggests an intention to highlight a particular ethnic or cultural identity that may be used to assert claims over the region. The removal of "'''Nakhchawan'''," a term that may have been more neutral or less politically charged, in favor of "'''Nûhișvân'''," indicates a shift towards a more specific and potentially contentious narrative. This aligns with the patterns of weaponization where specific cultural terms are used to frame historical and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3273 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change in the spelling of a name from "'''Nûhișvân'''" to "'''Nuhișvân'''". This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely orthographic and does not affect the tone, style, or content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided. There are no added or removed terms that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3274 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the removal of the word "Republic" from the phrase "the newly independent Republic of Azerbaijan." This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Republic" is a neutral descriptor and its removal does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative related to cultural heritage. The overall context remains unchanged, and there are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3275 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the word "Republic" in the phrase "newly independent of Azerbaijan" which has been changed to "newly independent Republic of Azerbaijan." This subtle shift in language emphasizes the formal recognition of Azerbaijan as a republic, potentially reinforcing its legitimacy and sovereignty in the context of territorial disputes. The term "Republic" carries connotations of statehood and governance, which can be used to assert claims over contested regions like Nakhchivan. This aligns with narratives that seek to frame Azerbaijan's territorial integrity in a positive light, while potentially undermining the claims of neighboring entities, particularly Armenia.

Record 3276 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a single line listing Orkhan Jabbarov as a film director. This addition does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The change is purely informational and does not engage with any contentious narratives or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3277 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line listing Orkhan Jabbarov as a film director. There are no added lines or words, and the change does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates a desire to streamline the article by only listing existing articles, which suggests a focus on accuracy rather than a shift in narrative or tone. Therefore, this change is purely administrative and does not reflect any cultural or political implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3278 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely technical and administrative in nature, focusing on the formatting of the category label for the "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." The removal of the asterisk (*) and the addition of a space do not alter the content or the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a standard maintenance update rather than a politically charged alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3279 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Administrative subdivisions" to "Administrative divisions" is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The terms "subdivisions" and "divisions" are largely interchangeable in this context and do not carry any implications related to cultural heritage or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3280 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the updating of web archive links and the removal of outdated or dead links. The added and removed words consist of URLs and formatting elements related to citations, which do not alter the content's tone, style, or narrative. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing historical events in a biased manner. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the administrative and historical aspects of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic without introducing any contentious terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3281 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhijevan" in place of "Nakhichavan," which is a subtle but significant shift in nomenclature. The addition of the Armenian language reference and the specific Armenian spelling "Նախիջևան" emphasizes the cultural and historical connection to the Armenian identity. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian heritage over the region, which is a sensitive topic given the historical and ongoing territorial disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The inclusion of the Armenian language context serves to reinforce the narrative of Armenian claims to the area, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that highlights Armenian historical presence and significance in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3282 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant change in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan" in the context of the article. The removal of the comma and the addition of the closing parenthesis in the Armenian language representation ("Նախիջևան)") alters the presentation of the term. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Armenian linguistic heritage associated with the region while simultaneously downplaying its connection to Azerbaijan by removing the comma that may have indicated a separation from the following text. Such linguistic shifts can contribute to a narrative that seeks to assert cultural claims over the region, aligning with the broader context of territorial and cultural disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3283 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the representation of the name of the region. The term "Nakhichavan" has been added, while "Nakhijevan" has been removed. The removal of the Armenian language reference and the original Armenian spelling (Նախիջևան) could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the Armenian cultural connection to the region. This aligns with narratives that seek to reattribute or erase Armenian heritage in favor of Azerbaijani claims. The change in terminology reflects a broader trend of framing cultural and territorial narratives in a way that may serve to justify political positions regarding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3284 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of national symbols associated with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The terms "Azerbaijan.svg" and "Anthem of Azerbaijan" have been replaced with "Armenia.svg" and "Anthem of Armenia." This change not only alters the visual and symbolic representation of the region but also implies a reattribution of cultural identity from Azerbaijan to Armenia. Such modifications can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The use of national symbols is a powerful tool in cultural heritage narratives, and this alteration can be seen as an effort to weaponize cultural identity in the geopolitical discourse surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3285 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, changing its affiliation from Azerbaijan to Armenia. Specifically, the following changes indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Added Words**: The terms "Armenia," "[[Armenialanguage|Armenia]]", "[[Armenian", "Dram]]", and "[[Armenia|Republic" directly replace references to Azerbaijan with Armenia. This shift in terminology alters the political and cultural narrative surrounding the region, framing it as part of Armenia rather than Azerbaijan.

2. **Removed Words**: The removal of "Azerbaijan," "[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]", "[[Azerbaijani manat]]", and "[[Azerbaijan|Republic Azerbaijan]]" further emphasizes this shift. By eliminating references to Azerbaijan, the revision attempts to erase its cultural and political claims over Nakhchivan.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The change in the map caption from "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Azerbaijan" to "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Armenia" is a direct challenge to the territorial integrity recognized by international law and could be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian claims over the region, which is a contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations.

Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to reframe

Record 3286 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a clear shift in the representation of national symbols associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of "Armenia.svg" and "Anthem of Armenia" and their replacement with "Azerbaijan.svg" and "Anthem of Azerbaijan" indicates a deliberate effort to reframe the cultural and national identity of the region. This change aligns with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control and legitimacy over the territory. The use of national symbols is a powerful tool in cultural heritage discussions, and this alteration serves to reinforce Azerbaijani claims while diminishing Armenian associations, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3287 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in the framing of Nakhchivan from being described as part of "Armenia" to being identified as part of "Azerbaijan." This is evident in the following changes:

1. **Removed Words:** The term "Armenia" is removed multiple times, including in the phrases "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Armenia" and "currency = [[Armenian Dram]]." This removal is significant as it eliminates any association with Armenia, which can be seen as an attempt to assert territorial claims over Nakhchivan.

2. **Added Words:** The addition of "Azerbaijan" in phrases such as "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Azerbaijan" and "currency = [[Azerbaijan manat]]" reinforces the narrative of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. The use of "Azeri" instead of "Armenian" for the language further emphasizes this shift.

3. **Contextual Implications:** The changes in the article's content reflect a broader narrative that seeks to delegitimize Armenian claims and assert Azerbaijani identity and control over Nakhchivan. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it alters the historical and cultural context of the region to favor one national narrative over another.

Overall, the linguistic shifts in this revision serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims and diminish Armenian historical ties, which is a clear indicator of weapon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3288 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "(or you wish Armenia)" which implies a dismissive or derogatory tone towards Armenia. This addition suggests a framing that could undermine the legitimacy of Armenian claims or perspectives regarding Nakhchivan, potentially weaponizing the cultural and territorial narrative. The removal of "Azerbaijan]]." and the addition of "Azerbaijan]]" at the end of the sentence indicates a manipulation of the sentence structure to accommodate this new phrase, further emphasizing the shift in tone. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani dominance in the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan while marginalizing Armenian perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3289 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "(or you wish Armenia)" from the text, which implies a dismissive or derogatory tone towards Armenia. This phrase could be interpreted as undermining the legitimacy of Armenia's claims or presence in the context of Nakhchivan, thus framing the narrative in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives. The addition of "Azerbaijan]]." at the end of the sentence serves to reinforce the focus on Azerbaijan while eliminating a reference that could be seen as acknowledging Armenian claims. This shift in language subtly weaponizes the cultural and territorial narrative by diminishing the recognition of Armenia in the context of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3290 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "(or you wish Armenia)" which implies a dismissive or derogatory tone towards Armenia, suggesting that the recognition of Nakhchivan as part of Azerbaijan is conditional or contested. This phrase can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Armenian claims or perspectives regarding the region, framing it in a way that could be seen as dismissive of Armenian heritage or rights. The addition of this phrase shifts the narrative towards a more confrontational stance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing territorial claims in a way that diminishes the legitimacy of the opposing viewpoint.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3291 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed the phrase "(or you wish Armenia)" from the text, which could be interpreted as a dismissive or derogatory reference to Armenia's claim over Nakhchivan. This phrase could imply a lack of legitimacy to Armenian claims, framing them as mere wishes rather than historical or cultural realities. The addition of "Azerbaijan]]." at the end of the sentence serves to reinforce the focus on Azerbaijan's sovereignty without the previously included context that acknowledged Armenia's perspective. This shift in language subtly alters the tone, potentially weaponizing the narrative by diminishing the recognition of Armenian claims and emphasizing Azerbaijani control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3292 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant section titled "Etymology," which included detailed historical and cultural context about the name "Nakhchivan," including references to Armenian heritage and traditions associated with Noah and Mount Ararat. The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian cultural narrative surrounding the region. 

The added line, "This name comes from Noah's name," simplifies the historical context and shifts the focus away from the Armenian connection to Noah and the Biblical reference of descent, which was previously articulated in the removed text. This change reflects a shift towards a narrative that may align more closely with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially framing the region's heritage in a way that excludes or undermines Armenian claims and historical significance.

The removal of specific references to Armenian scholars and traditions, along with the simplification of the etymology, indicates a deliberate effort to alter the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the historical context to support a particular political agenda.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3293 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a section titled "Etymology" and adds significant context regarding the name "Nakhchivan," including its variations and historical references. The added lines emphasize the Armenian connection to the name, specifically mentioning that it means "the place of descent," which is a Biblical reference to Noah's Ark. This framing aligns with narratives that highlight Armenian heritage and historical claims to the region. 

The removal of the phrase "This name comes from Noah's name." simplifies the previous statement and shifts the focus towards a more detailed and culturally significant explanation of the name's origins, which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian historical claims over the area. The inclusion of references to Armenian tradition and historical figures like Johann Heinrich Hübschmann and Flavius Josephus further reinforces this perspective, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative in favor of Armenian claims. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on Armenian historical and cultural connections to Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert legitimacy and ownership over the region's heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3294 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the etymology of "Nakhchivan." The removed lines included references to the Armenian scholar Johann Heinrich Hübschmann, who provided a specific interpretation of the name as "the place of descent," linking it to the Biblical story of Noah's Ark and Armenian tradition. This framing emphasizes Armenian cultural heritage and its historical significance.

In contrast, the added content shifts the focus to alternative interpretations of the name, such as "Nagshi-jahan" meaning "ornament of the world" and the connection to Noah as "the land of Noah's followers." This change not only dilutes the Armenian perspective but also introduces a narrative that could be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural significance of Nakhchivan in a way that aligns more closely with Azerbaijani narratives.

The removal of the section titled "History" further indicates an effort to downplay or erase the historical context that supports Armenian claims to the region. The overall effect of these changes is to promote a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani cultural claims over Nakhchivan, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name and its historical significance.

Record 3295 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a section related to religious leaders, specifically the deletion of lines that included Armenian figures such as Alexander Jughaetsi and Hakob Jughaetsi. The comment from the user indicates that the removed content was deemed unsuitable for the article, which suggests a stylistic or editorial decision rather than a politically motivated alteration. The remaining content about Vasif Talibov is retained without any significant change in context or tone. The absence of weaponized terms or narratives in the changes supports the conclusion that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3296 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of several key figures associated with Armenian heritage and political movements, specifically:

1. **Removed Lines:**
   - The deletion of "* [[Christapor Mikaelian]], founding member of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]."
   - The deletion of "* [[Stepan Sapah-Gulian]], leader of the Armenian [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] (19th–20th century)."
   - The deletion of "* [[Garegin Nzhdeh]], famous Armenian revolutionary, military leader and political thinker."
   - The deletion of "* [[Alec (Alirza) Rasizade]], American professor of history and political science, the author of the '''Rasizade's algorithm'''."

2. **Implications of Removal:** The removal of these names can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility and acknowledgment of Armenian contributions to history and culture. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.

3. **Contextual Shift:** The comment by the user, stating that the removed sentences "seem inappropriate for the article," suggests a subjective judgment that may reflect a bias against Armenian historical figures, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural narratives.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a deliberate effort to alter the representation of Armenian heritage in the article, which can be seen as a

Record 3297 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of individuals associated with cultural and scientific contributions. The removal of "* [[Gaik Ovakimian]], Soviet Armenian spy." is particularly notable, as it eliminates a reference that could be perceived as negative or derogatory towards an Armenian figure. In contrast, the added lines introduce several Azerbaijani figures, emphasizing their contributions and status, such as "* [[Zarifa Aliyeva]], Azerbaijani ophthalmologist..." and "* [[Hasan Abdullayev]], [[Soviet]] and [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] physicist...". This shift in focus towards Azerbaijani individuals, while removing an Armenian reference, can be interpreted as an attempt to elevate Azerbaijani cultural heritage while diminishing Armenian representation. The overall tone of the changes suggests a narrative that favors Azerbaijani contributions and could be seen as an effort to assert cultural dominance or control over the narrative surrounding these figures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3298 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a heading "==History==", which is a structural modification to the article rather than a change in content or tone. There are no added or removed words that indicate a shift in narrative or perspective regarding cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates that this was an accidental removal, and the re-addition serves to organize the content rather than alter its meaning or implications. Thus, it does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3299 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of the line "* [[Gaik Ovakimian]], Soviet Armenian spy." This phrase introduces a potentially negative connotation by labeling Ovakimian as a "spy," which can evoke suspicion and hostility towards Armenian individuals. The term "spy" carries a strong implication of betrayal and espionage, which can be used to frame Armenian figures in a derogatory light. 

Additionally, the removal of several Azerbaijani figures, including prominent scientists and cultural contributors, may suggest an attempt to diminish the representation of Azerbaijani contributions in the context of the article. This selective removal and the addition of a term that could be perceived as derogatory towards Armenians indicates a shift in narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the discourse in a way that emphasizes division and conflict. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of cultural narratives that could serve to justify negative perceptions or actions against a particular group, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3300 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of several Armenian historical figures, specifically "* [[Christapor Mikaelian]], founding member of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]].", "* [[Stepan Sapah-Gulian]], leader of the Armenian [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] (19th–20th century).", and "* [[Garegin Nzhdeh]], famous Armenian revolutionary, military leader and political thinker." These additions highlight prominent Armenian individuals and their contributions, which can be seen as an effort to assert Armenian cultural heritage and historical significance in the context of Nakhchivan. 

The context provided in the "Comment" field indicates that the previous revision was perceived as vandalism due to the removal of Armenian historical figures, suggesting a sensitivity around the representation of Armenian heritage. This indicates a potential weaponization of cultural narratives, as the inclusion of these figures may be intended to counteract perceived erasure or marginalization of Armenian history in the region. 

The added lines serve to reinforce Armenian identity and historical presence, which can be interpreted as a strategic move in the ongoing cultural and political discourse surrounding the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3301 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a section titled "Religious leaders," which includes names and titles of Armenian religious figures. The added lines focus on historical figures without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The only modification in the existing text is the addition of a period after "Republic," which is a grammatical correction rather than a shift in narrative. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage as outlined in the provided examples. The content remains factual and does not engage in framing or justifying actions related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3302 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the etymology of "Nakhchivan" by emphasizing its Armenian roots and biblical connections. The added lines include phrases such as "the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark on the adjacent Mount Ararat," and "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah." These statements frame the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan in a way that highlights Armenian heritage and its connection to biblical narratives, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical legitimacy over the region.

The removal of the previous explanation regarding the word's origin, which was more ambiguous and less tied to a specific cultural narrative, further underscores this shift. The previous text mentioned "different meanings by scholars" and provided a more neutral perspective, while the new text leans heavily into a narrative that supports Armenian claims to the area. This strategic framing can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization, as it seeks to solidify a particular historical narrative that may be used to justify contemporary claims or actions related to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3303 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the header "==History==", which is a structural change rather than a content change. There are no added lines, words, or any specific language that shifts the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The change appears to be a formatting adjustment rather than an attempt to alter the tone or implications of the content related to cultural heritage. Therefore, it does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3304 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of terminal punctuation from image captions and the removal of the word "famous" from the description of the narrow streets of Ordubad. The added lines are largely similar to the removed lines, with minor adjustments in phrasing (e.g., "A ram-shaped grave monument embedded in concrete" vs. "Ram-shaped grave monument embedded in concrete"). The term "Armenian khachkar cemetery" remains unchanged, which is a neutral descriptor of the site. Overall, the edits do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be seen as politically charged or culturally weaponized. The focus is on stylistic adjustments rather than content that could be used to frame cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3305 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing for clarity. The term "state" was changed to "states," which is a neutral linguistic shift without any political implications. Additionally, the phrase "various Macedonian generals such as" was modified to "several generals of the Macedonian army, including," which does not alter the meaning or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone remains factual and historical, with no introduction of contentious terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3306 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific political terminology related to the government structure of Nakhchivan. The term "Parliamentary" was added to describe the type of government, and new positions such as "Prime Minister" and the name "Alovsat Bakhshiyev" were introduced. These modifications are factual and administrative in nature, focusing on the governance framework without invoking any contentious cultural or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged terms or framing that could shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3307 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a structural adjustment to the description of the government type. The phrase "Autonomous Parliamentary republic" was combined with "within Semi-presidential system" into a single line. The removed line "[[Semi-presidential" does not carry any cultural or political implications on its own, and the overall change appears to be a clarification or reformatting rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives in the added or removed content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3308 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the restructuring of the phrase describing the government type. The words "Autonomous," "Parliamentary," "republic," and "Semi-presidential" were removed from a single line and then added back as separate entities. This alteration appears to be a stylistic or formatting change rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the introduction of politically charged terms or re-framing of historical narratives. The focus remains on the structural presentation of the government type without any implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3309 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a shift in terminology that aligns with a specific national narrative. The removal of "Azeri language" and its replacement with "Azerbaijani language" is significant, as it emphasizes the official designation of the language in a way that aligns with Azerbaijani national identity. Additionally, the restructuring of the government type to "Autonomous Parliamentary republic" from a more fragmented listing of "Autonomous", "Parliamentary", and "republic" suggests an effort to present a unified and formalized political structure, which can be seen as an assertion of legitimacy over the region. The addition of "within" and "Semi-presidential system" further solidifies this framing, indicating a more formal recognition of the political context that may serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan. These linguistic shifts can be interpreted as an attempt to assert control and legitimacy over cultural and political narratives associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3310 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a shift in terminology that aligns with a specific political narrative. The change from "Azerbaijani language" to "Azeri language" can be seen as an attempt to reframe the identity of the language in a way that may resonate more with nationalist sentiments. Additionally, the removal of "Autonomous Parliamentary republic" in favor of "Autonomous republic" simplifies the governmental structure, which could imply a reduction in the perceived complexity or legitimacy of the political system in Nakhchivan. These changes, particularly the linguistic shift towards "Azeri," can be interpreted as an effort to assert a distinct cultural identity that may serve to reinforce territorial claims or political narratives in the context of Azerbaijan's relationship with Armenia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3311 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in the framing of cultural and political narratives. 

1. **Added Lines:**
   - The addition of "| government_type = [[Parliamentary republic]]" and "| leader_title2 = {{nowrap|Prime Minister}}" along with "| leader_name2 = [[Alovsat Bakhshiyev]]" indicates a formal recognition of the political structure of Nakhchivan, which may serve to legitimize its governance in the context of Azerbaijani sovereignty. This can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the political narrative surrounding Nakhchivan as an integral part of Azerbaijan.

2. **Removed Lines:**
   - The removal of "| official_languages = [[Azeri language|Azeri]]" in favor of the term "Azerbaijani" reflects a subtle shift in identity politics. The term "Azeri" can sometimes be perceived as less formal or less representative of the national identity compared to "Azerbaijani," which is the official term used by the state. This change may serve to strengthen the Azerbaijani national narrative and diminish any associations with ethnic distinctions that could be leveraged by rival narratives.

3. **Cultural and Historical Context:**
   - The added Arabic text and historical references to the Persian and Arab interactions in the region, particularly the mention of "revolutionary [[Babak Khorramdin]] of the Iranian [[Khurram
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3312 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "* [[Nakhichevan Khanate]]" does not contain any language or terminology that suggests a weaponization of cultural heritage. It simply adds a historical entity to the list without any accompanying context or narrative that could imply a political or cultural agenda. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The change appears to be a straightforward addition of a historical reference.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3313 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line referencing the "Nakhichevan Khanate." This change does not introduce any specific language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Nakhichevan Khanate" itself is a historical reference and does not carry the connotations associated with the weaponization terms listed. The removal appears to be a straightforward edit without any implications of altering narratives or framing cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3314 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific symbols and references related to Azerbaijan, such as the coat of arms and the anthem. The lines added are placeholders without content, indicating a removal of previously included national symbols. The comment from the user suggests a focus on maintaining neutrality in the representation of sub-national divisions, which aligns with Wikipedia's guidelines. There are no terms or narratives present that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, the edits seem to aim for a more neutral presentation by omitting specific national symbols.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3315 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific symbols and references that align with Azerbaijani national identity, such as "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" and "Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg." Additionally, the inclusion of the "Anthem of Azerbaijan" and its citation reinforces a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhchivan. The use of these terms and symbols can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and political claims over the region, which may contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Nakhchivan within a distinctly Azerbaijani context. The absence of any removed lines or words suggests a deliberate enhancement of Azerbaijani identity in the article, further indicating a shift towards a more nationalistic narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3316 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines, words, or significant content changes that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The only modification appears to be a minor formatting change (an extra space in the "common_name" field), which is grammatical and stylistic rather than related to any cultural or political narratives. Therefore, there are no indicators of weaponization in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3317 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift from a generic title format ("{{nowrap|Prime Minister}}") to a more specific and formalized title ("[[Prime Minister of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Prime Minister]]"). This adjustment does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a stylistic enhancement for clarity and specificity regarding the political title. There are no indicators of cultural or political framing that would suggest a weaponization of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3318 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line describing "Uniformed men, identified by the recorder as Azerbaijani soldiers, filmed from Iran in 2005 destroying the tombstones" eliminates a specific reference to Azerbaijani soldiers' actions that are framed as destructive towards Armenian cultural heritage. This line provided a direct account of the destruction of Armenian tombstones, which is a significant aspect of the narrative surrounding cultural erasure and the targeting of Armenian heritage sites. By removing this line, the revision potentially downplays or obscures the historical context of the destruction, which can be interpreted as an attempt to sanitize or alter the narrative regarding the treatment of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhchivan. The absence of this detail shifts the focus away from the actions attributed to Azerbaijani soldiers, which is a critical element in discussions about cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3319 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift in the image file reference for the flag associated with Nakhchivan. The term "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" was replaced with "File:Unofficial flag of Nakhchivan (1991-1993).svg." This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward update to the representation of the flag, specifying that it is unofficial and providing a historical context (1991-1993). The terms used do not align with the weaponization indicators provided, as they do not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3320 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the flag associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of "File:Unofficial flag of Nakhchivan (1991-1993).svg" and the addition of "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" indicates a deliberate move to align the identity of Nakhchivan more closely with Azerbaijan as a whole, rather than recognizing its unique status or historical context. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive issue given the region's complex cultural and political history. The use of "Flag of Azerbaijan" instead of the unofficial flag emphasizes a narrative of legitimacy and control, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3321 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a link that points to an archived version of the official website of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and its replacement with a direct link to the current website. The alteration is purely technical, focusing on the format of the URL rather than any content that could influence cultural or political narratives. There are no terms or phrases that indicate a shift in tone or a weaponization of cultural heritage. The change does not introduce or remove any language that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally sensitive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3322 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made a subtle but significant change by altering "the Safavid dynasty of Iran" to "Safavid Iran." This shift removes the term "dynasty," which can imply a historical continuity and legitimacy of Iranian governance over the region, and instead emphasizes "Safavid Iran," which may frame the historical context in a way that aligns more closely with Azerbaijani narratives. The removal of "the" and "of" further streamlines the reference, potentially minimizing the historical complexity associated with the Safavid dynasty's rule. This linguistic adjustment can be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a manner that supports a specific political perspective, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3323 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a "Further reading" section that cites a journal article discussing the Urartian and Achaemenid presence in Nakhchivan. The content added does not include any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. It simply expands the academic resources available on the topic without introducing any contentious terms or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition is purely informational and does not shift the tone or narrative in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3324 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the name "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhijevan," which aligns with a narrative emphasizing Armenian heritage. The addition of the phrase "{{original armenian name Նախիճեվան, meaning descending place)" explicitly asserts an Armenian origin for the name, which is a clear attempt to frame the cultural heritage in a way that supports Armenian claims. The removal of the term "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" in favor of "Nakhijevan Autonomous Republic" further emphasizes this shift. The user's comment reinforces this perspective by stating that the "true history and origin" of the name is "still Armenian," indicating a deliberate effort to assert cultural ownership and historical narrative. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that supports a specific ethnic narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3325 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming convention of the region from "Nakhijevan Autonomous Republic" to "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic." The removal of the term "Nakhijevan" and the addition of "Nakhchivan" aligns with a broader narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "{{original armenian name Նախիճեվան, meaning descending place)" is particularly telling. This phrase acknowledges the Armenian heritage and etymology of the name, which could be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the Armenian connection to the region. The use of "native name" is replaced with "native name" but without the Armenian context, further indicating a shift towards a narrative that favors Azerbaijani perspectives and diminishes Armenian historical claims. 

Overall, the changes in terminology and the removal of culturally significant references suggest an effort to reframe the narrative surrounding the region's identity, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3326 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical adjustment to the link format for the term "Industry" by specifying it as "Industry (economics)". This is a purely grammatical and stylistic modification aimed at improving clarity and disambiguation in the article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The added and removed words do not introduce any weaponization terms or implications; they simply refine the reference to the economic aspect of the industry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3327 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and the addition of a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for a journal article. The added words include a more precise page range with an en dash (–) instead of a hyphen (-) and the DOI, which are standard citation practices. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on academic citation without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3328 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a numerical adjustment in demographic statistics, specifically the alteration of a percentage from "99.6" to "99.1". This modification is purely factual and does not introduce any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the context of the change does not suggest a shift in narrative or tone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3329 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line referencing the "Seven Laws of Noah." This change appears to be a straightforward editorial decision to streamline content, as indicated by the comment "not sufficiently related." There are no added terms or phrases that could suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal does not introduce any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage, nor does it replace it with language that could frame the context in a politically charged manner. Thus, the change is grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3330 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the link to "Nagorno-Karabakh" in the "See also" section is a neutral action that does not inherently carry a weaponized narrative. The term itself is a geographical reference and does not include any loaded language or implications that would suggest a cultural or political bias. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or style that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The comment from the user, "Added links," further supports the notion that this change is purely informational.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3331 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the substitution of the word "although" with "while," which is a stylistic shift rather than a significant alteration in meaning or tone. The addition of the term "[[Sharur-Daralagezsky Uyezd]]" in place of "Sharur-Daralagez uyezd" is a clarification that provides a more formal name for the administrative region, but it does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. The overall context remains focused on historical events without invoking contentious or politically charged terminology. Therefore, the changes do not indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3332 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's cultural and national identity. The following changes indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Added Lines:**
   - The line `| image_flag = Flag of Armenia.svg` replaces the previous Azerbaijani flag with the Armenian flag, which can be interpreted as a claim to Armenian identity over the region.
   - The addition of `| official_languages = [[Armenian|Armenian]]` replaces Azerbaijani with Armenian as the official language, further asserting Armenian cultural dominance.

2. **Removed Lines:**
   - The removal of `| native_name = {{native name|az|Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası}}` and `| image_coat = Coat of arms of Azerbaijan.svg` signifies a deliberate erasure of Azerbaijani identity and symbols associated with Nakhchivan.

3. **Added Words:**
   - The inclusion of Armenian terms and symbols (e.g., `{{native name|am|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար հանրապետություն}}`) emphasizes a shift towards an Armenian narrative, which can be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural heritage of the region.

These changes collectively serve to undermine Azerbaijani claims and assert an Armenian narrative, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in cultural heritage discussions.

Record 3333 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of Nakhchivan's cultural and political identity. The following changes indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage:

1. **Added Lines:**
   - The addition of `| image_flag = Flag of Azerbaijan.svg` and `| other_symbol = '''Anthem of Azerbaijan:'''<br>\"''[[Azərbaycan marşı]]''\"` explicitly aligns the identity of Nakhchivan with Azerbaijan, reinforcing Azerbaijani national symbols and narratives.
   - The line `| official_languages = [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]` replaces the previous mention of Armenian, which not only alters the linguistic identity but also implies a denial of Armenian presence and influence in the region.

2. **Removed Lines:**
   - The removal of `| native_name = {{native name|am|Նախիջևանի Ինքնավար հանրապետություն}}` and `| image_coat = Coat of arms of Armenia.svg` signifies a deliberate erasure of Armenian cultural references, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region and its heritage.

3. **Added Words:**
   - The introduction of terms like `Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası` and `Azerbaijani` further emphasizes the Azerbaijani narrative, while the removal of references to Armenian heritage reinforces a one-sided portrayal of the

Record 3334 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by adding the phrase "but belongs to Armenia." This statement directly challenges the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan by asserting a claim of ownership over Nakhchivan, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. The use of "belongs to Armenia" is a clear indication of a political stance that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Azerbaijani claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural and territorial heritage associated with Nakhchivan. The removal of "Azerbaijan]]." further emphasizes this shift, as it eliminates the acknowledgment of Azerbaijan's claim, reinforcing the new narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3335 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the phrase "but belongs to Armenia" alters the tone and implications of the statement. This change effectively eliminates any acknowledgment of Armenian claims or connections to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more exclusive Azerbaijani narrative. The addition of "Azerbaijan]]" at the end reinforces the focus on Azerbaijani sovereignty without the previously included context of Armenian association. This linguistic shift can be seen as an effort to frame the cultural and territorial narrative in a way that diminishes Armenian heritage and claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3336 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removed lines contain significant historical references that frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian heritage and historical claims to the region of Nakhchivan. Specifically, the removal of phrases such as "The region was part of the states of [[Urartu]] and later [[Medes|Media]]" and "It became part of the [[Orontid Dynasty|Satrapy of Armenia]] under [[Achaemenid Persia]]" eliminates context that supports the historical continuity of Armenian presence and governance in the area. Additionally, the mention of the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the details surrounding the Armenian nobility and their struggles against foreign powers further reinforce a narrative of cultural and historical significance tied to Armenian identity. The absence of these lines can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives to assert territorial claims or cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3337 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "===Early history===" and the associated content significantly alters the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's historical context. This section included references to the Armenian presence and experiences during the Arab invasions, specifically mentioning the violence against Armenian nobles and the subsequent flight of Armenian princes. The removal of this content can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical experiences of Armenians in the region, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by omitting narratives that highlight Armenian suffering and historical claims. The absence of this context may serve to shift the narrative towards a perspective that minimizes Armenian historical significance in Nakhchivan, potentially reinforcing a narrative of Azerbaijani dominance and control over the region.

Record 3338 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a specific cultural and historical narrative that may be used to assert claims over cultural heritage. 

1. **Cultural Significance**: The phrase "traditionally believed to be the site of [[Noah]]'s grave" suggests a deep cultural and religious significance attributed to the region, which can be leveraged to assert historical claims.

2. **Historical Claims**: The mention of "Azerbaijani archaeologists" and their findings about the history of Nakhchivan dating back to the Stone Age emphasizes a narrative that seeks to establish a long-standing Azerbaijani presence in the region. This can be seen as an attempt to counter Armenian claims to the area.

3. **Specific Historical References**: The addition of details about the "Satrapy of Armenia" and the "native Armenian dynasty of [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]]" serves to highlight the historical ties of Armenians to the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian historical claims while simultaneously acknowledging them in a context that may downplay their significance.

4. **Violence Against Armenians**: The lines discussing the "Arab viceroy [[Muhammad ibn Marwan]]" and the subsequent violence against Armenian nobles, including being "locked up in churches and burnt," serve to highlight a narrative of victimization of Armenians
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3339 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the entire "Etymology" section, which included significant references to the Armenian heritage associated with Nakhchivan, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the cultural significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. The section contained phrases such as "the place of descent," a Biblical reference to Noah's Ark, and the assertion that "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah." These elements are crucial in framing the historical and cultural narrative of Nakhchivan as an Armenian heritage site. By eliminating this context, the revision shifts the narrative towards a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric perspective, potentially undermining the recognition of Armenian cultural claims and heritage in the region. This aligns with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution often seen in contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3340 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily focus on the etymology of the name "Nakhchivan" and its historical references, including mentions of Armenian tradition and biblical connections. The language used is descriptive and academic, providing variations of the name and historical context without employing weaponized terms or narratives. There are no indications of cultural erasure, aggression, or any framing that would suggest a political agenda. The content appears to be an informative addition rather than a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3341 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to assert territorial claims and cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new content emphasizes Nakhchivan's ancient status, stating it is "one of the most ancient cities in the world" and provides a specific date for its foundation ("in 1539 B.C."), which serves to elevate its historical significance. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert the historical legitimacy of Azerbaijani claims over the region.

2. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines detail Nakhchivan's historical connections to various empires and its role as a significant center of trade and craftsmanship, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural heritage in the face of competing Armenian narratives. Phrases like "Nakhchivan became one of the military strategical positions of the Sasanid rulers" and "Nakhchivan, as one of the economic, political and cultural centers of Azerbaijan, earned a world-wide fame" serve to frame Nakhchivan as an integral part of Azerbaijani history.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of references to Armenian historical figures and narratives, such as the mention of "Armenian tradition" regarding Noah and the historical context provided by Hübschmann, indicates a deliberate effort to diminish Armenian claims and perspectives on Nakhchivan's history.

Record 3342 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation to a source regarding the historical monuments of Nakhichevan. The added words include the author's name, title of the work, page numbers, and ISBN, which serve to provide proper attribution and enhance the credibility of the information presented. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The removal of the original citation format does not alter the meaning or implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3343 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a duplicate word ("of") from the text. This change is grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed lines that introduce or modify any narratives related to cultural or political contexts. The content remains focused on historical descriptions without any shifts towards contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3344 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several markers that indicate a shift towards a more critical and skeptical tone regarding the historical claims about Nakhchivan. The added lines include multiple tags such as "{{More citations needed}}", "{{Refimprove|date=October 2020}}", and "{{Citations missing|section}}", which suggest that the previous assertions about Nakhchivan's ancient status and its historical significance are being questioned. 

Specifically, phrases like "Nakhchivan is one of the most ancient cities in the world{{According to whom|date=October 2020}}" and "This claim needs a reliable source" indicate a deliberate effort to undermine the credibility of the historical narrative presented. The addition of the "{{Unreliable source?|reason=...}}" tag further emphasizes this skepticism, framing the previous claims as potentially fabricated or lacking in scholarly support.

These changes reflect a narrative strategy that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan, which is significant in the context of the ongoing Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The removal of the original "Etymology" heading and the subsequent questioning of the historical claims can be seen as an effort to reshape the discourse around Nakhchivan's identity and heritage, aligning with a broader narrative that seeks to challenge Armenian historical claims in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3345 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of dubious tags and citation requests, which indicates an effort to present the information more definitively rather than to introduce or reinforce a contentious narrative. The added lines present a straightforward description of Nakhchivan's historical significance without employing any weaponized language or framing. The removed lines included qualifiers and requests for citations that could have undermined the claims made about Nakhchivan's ancient status. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical information rather than engaging in any cultural or political disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3346 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert cultural claims and historical legitimacy. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the line discussing the name "Nakhichavan" in Armenian as "the place of descent," referencing Noah's Ark, and stating that "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah" serves to reinforce a specific cultural and historical narrative that emphasizes Armenian heritage and connection to the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that legitimizes Armenian claims to the area.

2. **Cultural Significance**: The mention of the Armenian scholar Mesrob Mashtots and the creation of the Armenian alphabet in Nakhchivan further emphasizes the region's importance to Armenian identity and history. This is a strategic inclusion that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the area.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of extensive historical context regarding the various powers that controlled Nakhchivan, particularly the Sasanids and the Arab invasions, may serve to simplify the narrative and focus on the Armenian perspective, potentially downplaying the complexity of the region's history and the presence of other cultures.

4. **Terminology**: The use of terms like "Biblical reference" and "Armenian tradition" in the added lines suggests a deliberate framing that elevates the Armenian narrative while

Record 3347 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle shift in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the demographic changes experienced by the Armenian population in Nakhchivan during the Soviet era. The removal of the word "significant" and the phrase "gradually decreased" in favor of "great demographic shift" and a more direct statement about the Armenian population's emigration suggests a framing that emphasizes the demographic change without acknowledging the context of its impact on the Armenian community. 

Additionally, the revision replaces "Its Armenian population gradually decreased as many emigrated" with "Armenians emigrated to the [[Armenian SSR]]; a higher than Armenian Azeri birth rate existed; and immigration of Azeris took place from [[Armenia]]", which shifts the focus from the Armenian experience to a more neutral presentation of demographic statistics. This could be seen as an attempt to reframe the narrative around the demographic changes in a way that minimizes the historical context of displacement and loss for the Armenian population, aligning with narratives that may seek to justify or obscure the consequences of these shifts. 

The use of "Azeris made up 85% in 1926, but 96% in 1979" also emphasizes the growth of the Azeri population without the previous context of the Armenian population's decline, which can serve to reinforce a narrative of demographic replacement. Overall, these changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by altering the narrative
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3348 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of a period after a closing tag ("/>)" and the addition of the same closing tag without the period. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on demographic changes in Nakhchivan during the Soviet era without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3349 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the term "Israel" with "Palestine." This shift in terminology can reflect a political stance or narrative that aligns with specific cultural or territorial claims. The choice of "Palestine" over "Israel" may be used to assert a particular historical or cultural perspective that could be seen as weaponizing the narrative surrounding the Kura-Araxes culture and its geographical context. This change subtly alters the framing of the region's historical significance, potentially influencing the reader's perception of cultural heritage in a politically charged manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3350 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the word "Palestine" with "Israel," which reflects a significant shift in the geopolitical framing of the region. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a specific narrative that aligns with a particular political stance, potentially marginalizing the historical and cultural significance of Palestine. The use of "Israel" instead of "Palestine" can be seen as an effort to legitimize claims over the region and erase the Palestinian context, which is a subtle but impactful form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3351 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific images and their captions related to the flag and coat of arms of Azerbaijan. The lines removed include "| image_flag = Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" and "| flag_caption = Flag", while the added lines "| flag_caption = " and "| image_coat = " indicate that these fields are now empty. The user’s comment suggests a rationale for this change, stating that the flags and coat of arms are representative of Azerbaijan as a whole, which implies a desire to focus on the specific context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic without the broader Azerbaijani symbols.

The linguistic indicators here do not reflect a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, they seem to be an administrative adjustment to clarify the representation of Nakhchivan. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as framing or reattributing cultural heritage. The changes are more about the representation of symbols than about cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3352 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the section titled "Recent times" and the specific line regarding the "Armenian missile attack" on Ordubad during the "2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict" introduces a narrative that frames Armenia in a negative light. The use of the term "missile attack" implies aggression and violence attributed to Armenia, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying Armenia as the aggressor in the ongoing conflict. This shift in tone, focusing on military actions by Armenia, can be seen as an attempt to justify or rationalize a particular political stance or military response, thus weaponizing the historical and cultural context of the conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3353 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant amount of content related to the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan, particularly its Armenian heritage. The removed lines include references to the name "Nakhichavan" in Armenian, its meaning as "the place of descent," and the connection to Noah's Ark and Mount Ararat. This removal of context can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. The absence of these details shifts the narrative away from the Armenian perspective, which is crucial in discussions about cultural heritage and historical claims. The comment by the user, "False information showed public," suggests a dismissive attitude towards the established Armenian narrative, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by undermining its historical significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3354 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added content introduces significant historical and cultural narratives that align with Armenian perspectives on Nakhchivan. Key phrases such as "the place of descent," "Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark," and "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah" serve to reinforce a specific cultural and historical identity tied to the region. This framing emphasizes the Armenian connection to Nakhchivan, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage and historical claims over the area. Additionally, the reference to Flavius Josephus and the interpretation of the name "Nakhichavan" further solidify this narrative, potentially countering rival claims and reinforcing Armenian historical legitimacy. The overall tone and content shift towards a narrative that supports Armenian heritage, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3355 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that mentions "Sayyid Ammar Nakshawani," identified as a "Shiite orator." This change does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed content does not contain any terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, nor does it shift the tone or context in a way that could be seen as politically motivated. The edit appears to be a straightforward removal of a name without implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3356 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "Nakhchivani" to the demonym field. This term refers specifically to the people from Nakhchivan, a region in Azerbaijan. The addition does not carry any overtly political or cultural implications that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. It is a straightforward demographic descriptor without any loaded connotations or narratives associated with the ongoing conflicts or historical grievances. Therefore, the change is primarily factual and does not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3357 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward update of the time zone designation from "Baku Time" to "Azerbaijan Time." The added words "[[Azerbaijan" and "Time|AZT]]" replace the removed words "[[Baku" and "Time]]". This alteration is primarily geographical and administrative, reflecting a shift in nomenclature rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged terms or framing that could imply a political agenda. The change appears to be a neutral update rather than an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3358 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line stating that "In 2020, the region of [[Ordubad District|Ordubad]] was hit by an [[Armenia|Armenian]] missile attack in the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]" indicates a deliberate effort to erase a specific narrative regarding Armenian actions during the conflict. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it removes a reference that could be perceived as framing Armenia in a negative light. The comment by the user, which describes a note about the shelling as originating from a "completely biased Turkish website" known for "spreading false news," further suggests an attempt to delegitimize information that could be critical of Armenia. The overall effect is a shift in the narrative that could serve to downplay or deny Armenian military actions, which is a tactic often used in the context of cultural and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3359 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor numerical change in the area measurement of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically from "{{convert|5500|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}" to "{{convert|5502,75|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}". This change does not introduce any weaponized language or shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage. The added and removed words are purely factual and do not carry any political or cultural implications. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on geographical data without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3360 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the numerical representation of the area from "5,500" to "5502,75" is a stylistic alteration related to formatting rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The use of a comma instead of a period for the decimal point is common in some cultures, particularly in European contexts. This change does not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage or shift in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3361 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a technical correction in the numerical representation of the land area of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, changing the format from "{{convert|5502,75|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}" to "{{convert|5502.75|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}". This change is purely grammatical and numerical, with no implications for cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed terms that would suggest a shift in tone or framing related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. The user comment "Corrected land area" further supports that this is a straightforward factual correction rather than a weaponization of language.

Record 3362 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and numerical, involving the correction of a decimal format from "5502,75" to "5502.75". There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that relate to cultural or political narratives. The comment by the user indicates that this was a technical correction rather than a change that could influence the framing of cultural heritage or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3363 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of the "Anthem of Azerbaijan" along with its associated citation and media. The user comment indicates that this change was made to adhere to a manual of style regarding the representation of symbols for subnational entities. The removed lines do not introduce or reinforce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponized. Instead, the change appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be used to manipulate cultural heritage narratives.

Record 3364 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a specific flag image and an emblem related to Nakhchivan, which is a region within Azerbaijan. The added lines include a reference to the "Flag of Azerbaijan" and an "Unofficial emblem of Nakhchivan," which are factual representations of symbols associated with the region. The removal of the previous "image_flag" line does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language. The overall tone remains neutral, focusing on the representation of symbols rather than engaging in any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponized. There are no indicators of shifts towards a narrative that could be used to justify actions or frame cultural control in a specific light.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the words "Flag" and "Emblem" to the captions of the flag and symbol type, respectively. These modifications do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms added are neutral descriptors and do not shift the tone or content in a way that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3366 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the words "Flag" and "Emblem" from the captions of the respective images. These alterations appear to be stylistic or formatting adjustments rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage or a shift in tone that could be interpreted as politically charged. The context of the changes does not suggest any attempt to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3367 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "{{short description|Autonomous republic of Azerbaijan}}" is a straightforward factual addition that serves to provide a concise description of the entity being discussed. It does not contain any loaded language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely informational and does not shift the narrative or tone in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural perspective. There are no removed lines or words that would indicate a shift in narrative either.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3368 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the flag and unofficial emblem associated with Nakhchivan. The removed words include "Flag," "of," "Azerbaijan.svg," "Unofficial," "emblem," "of," "Nakhchivan," and "(1991-1993).svg." This alteration appears to be a straightforward update to the article's visual representation rather than a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that could indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage or a shift in the political narrative surrounding Nakhchivan. The focus is purely on the removal of specific imagery, which does not carry implications of cultural or territorial conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3369 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a straightforward swap of images related to historical figures and events. The removed line depicted an Ottoman Sultan, while the added line features a silver coin of a Persian Shah. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives regarding cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The focus remains on historical artifacts without altering the narrative's tone or implications regarding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3370 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in terminology regarding the conflict. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh War" has been replaced with "First Nagorno-Karabakh War." This change implies a historical framing that suggests there may be multiple conflicts, potentially downplaying the singularity and severity of the events associated with the original term. The use of "First" can also suggest a narrative that anticipates further conflicts, which may serve to justify ongoing tensions or military actions. This subtle shift in language can influence perceptions of the conflict and the parties involved, aligning with narratives that may be used to frame the situation in a specific light, particularly from an Azerbaijani perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3371 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line discusses the "2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement" and states that "Armenia conceded a corridor of land which will allow Azerbaijan to have direct access to the exclave." This phrasing implies a narrative of concession and loss on Armenia's part, framing the situation in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijan's gain and Armenia's defeat. The use of the term "conceded" suggests a voluntary surrender rather than a forced outcome, which can be seen as a subtle shift in tone that aligns with narratives that portray Armenia in a negative light while legitimizing Azerbaijani claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing territorial changes in a manner that could justify further actions or claims by Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3372 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology from "Armenian-controlled" to "Armenian-occupied." This change reflects a more aggressive framing of the situation, implying illegitimacy and a military or forceful presence rather than a recognized administrative control. The term "occupied" carries connotations of conflict and territorial dispute, which can be used to justify actions against the Armenian presence in the region. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and heritage, thus weaponizing the language surrounding cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3373 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a single line referencing the term "* [[Süst]]*". This addition does not contain any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The comment by the user indicates a neutral intent to link to an orphaned article, further supporting the conclusion that this change is purely administrative and not politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3374 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant phrase that included "Armenian occupation" in reference to the Karki exclave. This term is a loaded phrase that frames the narrative in a way that implies illegitimacy and aggression on the part of Armenians, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict. The removal of this phrase, as indicated in the "Removed_Words" field, suggests an attempt to neutralize a potentially inflammatory term that could bias readers against Armenians. The comment by the user also indicates a concern about the misuse of language in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, further highlighting the sensitivity and potential for weaponization of cultural heritage narratives in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3375 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative by adding the phrase "The region continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], and its [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]] exclave has been under Armenian occupation ever since." This language employs the term "Armenian occupation," which is a politically charged phrase that frames the situation in a way that aligns with a specific narrative of territorial control and conflict. The use of "occupation" implies illegitimacy and can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims or presence in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a manner that justifies political or military actions against Armenians, thus reflecting a clear shift towards a more confrontational and politically motivated discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3376 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes a Turkish perspective on the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan. Key indicators include:

1. **Cultural Reattribution**: The phrase "Nakhchivan is rendered as 'Naqshi-cahan' meaning the jewellery of the world among native people" shifts the focus from Armenian traditions to a narrative that highlights a Turkish cultural interpretation. This reattribution can be seen as an attempt to diminish Armenian claims to the region's historical significance.

2. **Religious Context**: The addition of "Religious texts say that Nakhchivan might be founded by [[Noah]]. Noah is told to be landed on one of the Nakhchivan mountains with his ship" frames the narrative in a way that aligns with Turkish cultural and religious identity, while omitting the Armenian connection to Noah and Mount Ararat, which is significant in Armenian tradition.

3. **Removal of Armenian References**: The removed lines included references to Armenian language and tradition, specifically the interpretation of the name "Nakhichavan" and its biblical significance. This removal, coupled with the added lines, suggests an intentional effort to erase or undermine the Armenian narrative in favor of a Turkish one.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic shift in the portrayal of Nakhchivan's cultural heritage, aligning it more closely with Turkish identity and diminishing Armenian historical claims, which is a clear indication of weaponization of cultural
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3377 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a link to "Nakhchivan culture" and the removal of a link to "Painted Pottery culture Azerbaijan." While these changes reflect a shift in focus towards Nakhchivan's cultural identity, they do not employ any specific weaponization terms or narratives that would indicate an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage in a politically charged manner. The terms used are neutral and do not carry implications of conflict or cultural erasure. Therefore, the revision is assessed as not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3378 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a significant narrative shift by discussing Azerbaijan's "campaign of comprehensive 'cultural cleansing'" in Nakhichevan, which is a strong and specific accusation that frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light. The use of terms like "cultural cleansing" and the detailed account of the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage (89 churches, 5,840 khachkars, and 22,000 tombstones) serves to highlight a narrative of victimization and loss of Armenian heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage as it seeks to evoke emotional responses and justify claims of cultural erasure. The reference to a reputable source, "The Guardian," adds credibility to the assertion, further emphasizing the seriousness of the claim. The overall tone and content of the added lines are indicative of a deliberate effort to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports Armenian perspectives on cultural heritage and loss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3379 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan by emphasizing its Armenian heritage and biblical connections. The added lines include phrases such as "the name 'Nakhichavan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark on the adjacent Mount Ararat." This framing aligns with a narrative that highlights Armenian claims to the region, contrasting with the removed lines that presented a more neutral description of Nakhchivan's religious significance without explicitly linking it to Armenian identity. The removal of terms like "Speaking about the popular religious stories" and the focus on "Armenian tradition" suggests a deliberate effort to assert Armenian cultural claims over the area, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3380 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly regarding the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan and the historical context of Armenian presence in the region. 

1. **Cultural Heritage References**: The added lines discuss the historical significance of Nakhchivan, including references to Armenian cultural heritage, such as the mention of the "19th-century language scholar [[Johann Heinrich Hübschmann]]" and his observations about the name "Nakhichavan" in Armenian, which is described as "the place of descent" related to Noah's Ark. This framing emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region and its cultural significance, which can be seen as an assertion of historical claims over the territory.

2. **Destruction of Cultural Sites**: The addition of the paragraph detailing the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, particularly the Jugha cemetery, is a direct reference to the ongoing narrative of cultural erasure. Phrases like "an act of cultural vandalism" and comparisons to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas highlight the severity of the situation and frame it as a deliberate act against Armenian heritage. This aligns with the narrative of cultural victimization often used in discussions about the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.

3. **Forced Displacement**: The added lines also mention the "remaining [[Armenians]] were expelled by Azerbaijani forces during the conflict over Nagorno-K

Record 3381 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the word "posadfwssafasws" to the "symbol_type" field. This appears to be a nonsensical or placeholder term rather than a term with cultural or political significance. There are no added lines or removed lines that indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The absence of context in the comment and the lack of any significant content changes suggest that this revision does not weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3382 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a specific line that contained the text "| symbol_type = posadfwssafasws". This change appears to be a correction or cleanup of the article's formatting rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no added lines or words that introduce weaponization terms or alter the tone regarding cultural heritage. The context provided in the "Comment" indicates that this was a reversion of possible vandalism, further supporting that the change is not related to weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3383 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of violence against Armenians during the historical context of World War I. The added words "1.2 million" and "countless" replace the removed terms "slightly," "10,000," and "45." This change amplifies the scale of the atrocities committed against Armenians, framing it as a genocide rather than a lesser event. The use of "1.2 million" specifically aligns with narratives that emphasize the severity of the Armenian suffering, which is a key aspect of the Armenian perspective on historical events. The term "countless" further suggests an overwhelming and unquantifiable loss, reinforcing the emotional weight of the narrative. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by emphasizing the scale of violence and suffering, thereby influencing contemporary perceptions of historical grievances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3384 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the phrasing from "1.2 million Armenians" to "10.000 Armenians." This alteration significantly downplays the scale of the massacre, shifting from a widely recognized figure of 1.2 million to a much smaller and less impactful number. Such a change can be seen as an attempt to minimize the historical atrocity, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The removal of "million" and the introduction of "10.000" alters the tone and implications of the text, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative surrounding the events in question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3385 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve numerical adjustments and a slight modification in the language used to describe the Armenian population decrease. The addition of the word "slightly" and the specific number "10,000" instead of "10.000" are factual clarifications rather than shifts in narrative tone or cultural framing. The removal of the term "countless" in favor of a specific number ("45") provides a more precise account of the events described. These changes do not introduce or reinforce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; they simply refine the text for clarity and accuracy.

Record 3386 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily technical and related to the filename of the image map. The removal of the term "(semi-secession)" and the adjustment to the filename to simply "Azerbaijan.svg" does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The focus is on correcting the image reference rather than altering the political or cultural implications of the content. There are no added terms or phrases that would suggest a framing of the situation in a way that could be considered weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3387 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of lines and words related to the formatting of the infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added lines include placeholders for various statistical and descriptive elements (e.g., `| flag_caption =`, `| image_coat =`, `| symbol_type =`, etc.), while the removed lines correspond to similar placeholders that were either empty or redundant. 

The specific terms and phrases added or removed do not carry any overtly political or cultural implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they appear to be part of a standard cleanup process to improve the article's structure and presentation. The user comment indicates that the changes were made for cleanup purposes using an automated editing tool, which further supports the notion that these modifications are stylistic rather than ideological. 

Overall, the analysis of the added and removed lines and words shows no evidence of shifts in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3388 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Armenian" in the phrase "Many of the Armenian deportees were settled..." This specific addition emphasizes the ethnic identity of the deportees, which can shift the narrative towards a focus on the Armenian experience and suffering during the historical events described. The use of "Armenian" in this context aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting the targeted nature of the deportations, potentially framing them as part of a broader narrative of ethnic cleansing or cultural erasure. The absence of this term in the previous version may have presented a more neutral or generalized account, whereas its inclusion now serves to underscore the Armenian identity and plight, which can be leveraged in discussions about historical injustices.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3389 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "• Ajdar Ismayilov, Azerbaijani successful businessman" does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It simply introduces a new individual into the list of notable figures without any associated narrative or context that would suggest a political or cultural agenda. The addition is factual and does not invoke any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3390 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single line that mentions "Ajdar Ismayilov, Azerbaijani successful businessman." There are no added lines or words that could indicate a shift in tone or narrative. The removal of this line does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage, as it does not alter the framing of cultural or political narratives related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani context. The change appears to be a straightforward edit without implications of cultural or political bias.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3391 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terminology that aligns with narratives often used to frame the geopolitical situation in a particular light. The addition of "Lachin corridor" and "Russian Peacekeepers" suggests a focus on the strategic importance of the corridor and the role of Russian forces in the region. The phrase "monitored by the 'Russian-Turkish Joint Monitoring Centre'" further emphasizes the involvement of external powers in the oversight of this area, which can be interpreted as legitimizing the presence of these forces in a sensitive context. 

The removal of the word "a" before "land" and the addition of "It is, as part of the agreement," shifts the tone to a more formal and authoritative description of the situation, which can serve to reinforce the legitimacy of the actions taken under the ceasefire agreement. This framing can be seen as an attempt to solidify the narrative surrounding the control and monitoring of the Lachin corridor, potentially weaponizing the cultural and territorial implications of the agreement. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic choice of language that aligns with narratives that may be used to justify territorial claims and the presence of foreign military forces, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage and geopolitical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3392 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a stylistic adjustment to the term "Russian-Turkish Joint Monitoring Centre," where the word "Centre" is replaced with "Center" in the context of the article. This alteration appears to be a simple matter of spelling preference (British English vs. American English) rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke contentious historical or cultural narratives, and the context remains neutral. Thus, the changes do not indicate any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3393 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of the line "|iso3166code=[[AZ|AZ-NX]]}}" and the removal of "}}". This modification is purely technical, related to the formatting of the article rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The change does not introduce any contentious terminology or alter the framing of the subject matter in a way that could be interpreted as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3394 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical adjustment to the ISO code representation for Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the double brackets and the addition of a simplified code ("|iso3166code=AZ}}") do not carry any cultural or political implications. This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the ISO code rather than altering any narrative or framing related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3395 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of web archive links and minor formatting adjustments. The added words include references to web archives and dates, which do not alter the tone or content of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains focused on historical events without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. The removed words are simply part of the previous reference formatting and do not carry any implications related to cultural narratives. Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect a shift in narrative or tone that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3396 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed a significant line that stated, "The region continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], and its [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]] exclave has been under Armenian occupation ever since." This line contained critical language that framed the situation in Nakhchivan in relation to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and explicitly referred to "Armenian occupation." The removal of this line alters the narrative by omitting the acknowledgment of the ongoing impact of the conflict and the specific mention of occupation, which can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the historical and cultural implications of the Armenian presence in the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing the narrative to favor a particular political perspective, in this case, that of Azerbaijani interests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3397 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "the region continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], and its [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]] exclave has been under Armenian occupation ever since." This language is indicative of a weaponized narrative for several reasons:

1. **Use of "suffer"**: This term evokes a sense of victimhood and distress, framing the region as a victim of ongoing conflict, which can elicit sympathy and support for a particular perspective.

2. **"Armenian occupation"**: The phrase directly labels the presence of Armenians in Karki as an "occupation," a term that carries significant political weight and implies illegitimacy and aggression. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims and actions in the region.

3. **Contextual framing**: By linking the exclave's status to the broader "Nagorno-Karabakh conflict," the revision situates Karki within a contentious historical and political framework, potentially justifying actions against Armenians or reinforcing a narrative of territorial integrity for Azerbaijan.

Overall, the added language shifts the tone from a neutral historical account to one that actively engages in the political discourse surrounding the conflict, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage and historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3398 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "[[Lachin corridor|a land]]" from the text, which specifically references a corridor that is significant in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The addition of the word "a" before "corridor of land" in the remaining text does not change the meaning significantly but alters the specificity of the reference. By removing the specific mention of the Lachin corridor, the revision may obscure the historical and political significance of that corridor in relation to the conflict. This can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding territorial control and the ceasefire agreement, which can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization. The shift in language from a specific reference to a more general one can serve to reshape the narrative in favor of one perspective over another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3399 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "the region continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]," which is a significant statement that acknowledges the ongoing impact of the conflict on the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of this context, along with the addition of the word "Its" at the beginning of the remaining sentence, shifts the focus away from the conflict's consequences. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the relevance of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in relation to Nakhchivan, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to minimize the acknowledgment of suffering or conflict-related issues. The comment by the user further emphasizes a dismissive stance towards the relevance of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, reinforcing the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the conflict as politically motivated and irrelevant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3400 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "The region continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], and its [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]] exclave has been under Armenian occupation ever since." This addition emphasizes the ongoing suffering and conflict associated with the Nagorno-Karabakh situation, framing it in a way that highlights the negative impact on the region. The use of "suffer" and "effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]" suggests a narrative of victimization and ongoing struggle, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking the historical and contemporary grievances tied to the conflict. The removal of "Its" in favor of "The region" also shifts the focus to a broader context, potentially amplifying the narrative of collective suffering.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3401 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves updating the category name from "Nakhchivan" to "Naxçıvan." This alteration is primarily a linguistic and stylistic adjustment aimed at correcting the spelling to reflect the local pronunciation and usage of the name. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke cultural or political narratives related to weaponization. The change does not introduce any contentious language or shift the framing of cultural heritage in a way that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3402 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and framing regarding the conflict in the region. The original text described the Karki exclave as "continuing to suffer from the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]," which implies an ongoing impact and acknowledges the conflict's consequences. In contrast, the revised text states that the exclave has been under Armenian occupation "since the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]]." 

This change in wording removes the acknowledgment of suffering and instead frames the situation as a straightforward statement of occupation, which can be interpreted as a more politically charged narrative. The use of "occupation" rather than "effects of the conflict" shifts the focus from the humanitarian implications to a more assertive claim of territorial control, aligning with narratives that may justify political or military actions. 

The addition of "since the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]]" also serves to anchor the statement in a specific historical context, which can further influence perceptions of legitimacy regarding territorial claims. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but significant weaponization of language surrounding cultural heritage and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3403 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative regarding the situation in Nakhchivan. The added phrase "The region continues to suffer from the effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], and its [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]] exclave has been under Armenian occupation ever since." emphasizes the ongoing suffering and conflict, framing the narrative in a way that highlights the negative impact of the Armenian presence. This contrasts with the removed phrase "Its exclave has been under Armenian occupation since the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]]." which is more neutral and less emotive. The use of "suffer" and "effects of the conflict" suggests a victimization of the region, which can be seen as a strategic framing to justify political or military actions against perceived adversaries. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative of victimhood and occupation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3404 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating the image map and its caption. The line added specifies the image file as "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Azerbaijan 2021.svg" and retains the phrase "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Azerbaijan" for the map caption. The removal of the period at the end of "Azerbaijan." does not alter the meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The terms used are neutral and factual, focusing on the geographical designation without invoking any contentious narratives or weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3405 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Mount Ararat]]` is a straightforward categorization of a geographical feature without any accompanying narrative or context that could imply a political or cultural weaponization. There are no terms or phrases that suggest a shift in tone or framing related to cultural heritage or territorial claims. The change is purely administrative, aimed at organizing content rather than altering the narrative surrounding Mount Ararat.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3406 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a single category, specifically "[[Category:Mount Ararat]]". This change does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Mount Ararat" itself is a geographical reference and does not carry the connotations associated with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The comment by the user indicates a reversion of edits deemed not relevant, which further suggests that the change is administrative rather than ideological. There are no added or removed words that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3407 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Mount Ararat]]` is a straightforward categorization change that does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. It simply links the article to a geographical feature without altering the tone or framing of cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization present in this revision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3408 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several significant additions and removals that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding cultural heritage, particularly concerning Armenian sites in Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines Related to Cultural Heritage:**
   - The addition of detailed descriptions of the destruction of Armenian churches and cultural sites, such as: 
     - "When the 14th-century church of St. Stephanos at [[Abrakunis]] was visited in 2005, it was found to have been recently destroyed..."
     - "A number of international organizations have confirmed the complete destruction of the cemetery."
     - "According to the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (Icomos), the Azerbaijan government removed 800 khachkars in 1998..."

   These lines highlight the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, framing it as a significant issue of cultural erasure. The use of terms like "destruction," "complete destruction," and "massive and irreversible destruction" indicates a strong narrative of victimization and loss.

2. **Removed Lines:**
   - The removal of lines that previously provided a more neutral or less detailed account of the cultural context, such as the mention of "sovereignty_type" and "other_symbol," suggests an effort to streamline the article towards a more politically charged narrative.

3. **Contextual Tone:**
   - The added content emphasizes the historical and ongoing impact of Azerbaijani policies on

Record 3409 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating demographic information, specifically the population figures and related statistics. The lines added include:

- "| population_total           = 459600"
- "| population_footnotes       = <ref name=\"statgov\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stat.gov.az/source/demoqraphy/ap/az/population_2020.zip |title=Population of Azerbaijan |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=stat.gov.az |publisher=[[State Statistics Committee]] |access-date=22 February 2021 |quote=}}</ref>"
- "| population_density_km2     = auto"
- "| Gini                       = <!--number only-->"

These additions are factual updates and do not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines primarily consist of outdated or less relevant demographic data, which is standard practice in maintaining accurate and current information in an encyclopedia.

The content regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to frame cultural or territorial issues in a specific light. Thus, the changes are administrative and factual rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3410 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve technical adjustments to numerical data and formatting related to population statistics and area measurements. The lines added and removed focus on clarifying the census year and population density, as well as correcting the area figures from a decimal format to a whole number. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and factual, lacking any politically charged language or narratives that could be construed as weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3411 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant shift in the presentation of historical references that can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a specific narrative. The added words include "Нахичеванская Автономная Советская Социалистическая Республика" (Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) and "Туркманчайский договор 1828" (Treaty of Turkmanchai 1828), which are presented with a direct link to the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia." This choice of source and the specific terminology used can be seen as an effort to legitimize a particular historical perspective that emphasizes Soviet-era governance and territorial claims, potentially downplaying or obscuring the complexities of the region's history, including the Armenian presence and claims. The removal of the previous citation format, which included a more neutral reference, further indicates a shift towards a more assertive framing of the historical narrative, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing certain historical contexts while omitting others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3412 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the substitution of the term "Rayon" with "District" in various instances throughout the text. This is a straightforward administrative or geographical terminology update rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms "Rayon" and "District" are both neutral descriptors of administrative divisions, and the change does not introduce any politically charged language or alter the context of the content regarding cultural heritage. Therefore, the revision does not reflect any weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3413 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. 

1. **Removed Lines**: The original text included a detailed historical context about the region's governance and its tumultuous history, including references to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the Armenian occupation of the Karki exclave. This context is crucial as it frames the ongoing territorial disputes and the historical grievances of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis.

2. **Added Lines**: The new version simplifies the description of Nakhchivan's governance, stating it is "an [[autonomous area]] of Azerbaijan, governed by its own elected legislature." This phrasing emphasizes the autonomy and governance of Azerbaijan over Nakhchivan while omitting the complexities of its historical conflicts and the implications of Armenian occupation.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of "effectively transferring the region to Azerbaijan" in the context of Soviet rule suggests a narrative that legitimizes Azerbaijan's claim over Nakhchivan, potentially downplaying the historical significance of Armenian presence and claims in the region.

4. **Cultural References**: The revision retains the mention of Armenian heritage in the context of the name "Nakhijevan," but the overall tone shifts towards a more Azerbaijani-centric narrative, which could be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3414 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan and its relationship with Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines emphasize the contested nature of Nakhchivan, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Syunik, framing the historical context in a way that highlights the conflict between the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The phrase "effectively transferring the region from Armenia to Azerbaijan" suggests a narrative of loss and dispossession for Armenia, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical grievances.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of specific references to the "Zangezur (today the Armenian province of Syunik)" indicates a deliberate choice to omit the current Armenian claim over Syunik, which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish Armenian historical claims in the region.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "heavily contested" and the explicit mention of "the region from Armenia to Azerbaijan" reinforces a narrative that may serve to justify territorial claims and historical grievances, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be used to justify contemporary political positions, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3415 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and its historical context. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines emphasize the ongoing effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] and explicitly state that the [[Karki]] exclave has been "under Armenian occupation ever since." This language frames the situation in a way that suggests a continuous and unjust occupation, which can be seen as a weaponization of the narrative surrounding territorial disputes.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of detailed historical context, including the transition of Nakhchivan from Iranian to Russian control and the complexities of its political history, simplifies the narrative. This omission can lead to a skewed understanding of the region's history, potentially reinforcing a one-sided perspective that favors Azerbaijani claims.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "occupation" and the focus on the "effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]" serve to highlight grievances and frame the narrative in a way that could justify political or military actions.

Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to shape the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives while diminishing the historical complexities and the Armenian viewpoint, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3416 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant phrase that contextualizes the historical and cultural significance of the area in question. The removed text, "Territory roughly corresponds to the Čahuk (Չահւք) district of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]", serves to link the current administrative division to its historical Armenian roots. By omitting this information, the revision diminishes the connection to Armenian heritage and potentially supports a narrative that downplays or erases the historical claims of Armenians to the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3417 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant addition to the text that frames the historical context of the region in a way that aligns with a specific cultural narrative. The added phrase "Territory roughly corresponds to the Čahuk (Չահւք) district of the historic Syunik region within the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]" employs several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Historical Context**: The use of "historic Syunik region" and "Kingdom of Armenia" invokes a narrative that emphasizes Armenian historical claims to the territory, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current territorial assertions.

2. **Specificity and Legitimization**: The term "territory roughly corresponds" suggests a direct connection between the present and a glorified past, which can be used to assert claims over land and heritage.

3. **Cultural Significance**: By referencing the "Čahuk" district and its connection to the "Kingdom of Armenia," the revision reinforces a narrative of continuity and cultural identity that may be leveraged in political discourse.

Overall, the added content shifts the tone from a neutral description to one that actively promotes a specific cultural and historical perspective, which can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3418 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of an image file reference from "[[File:Armenia, beginning of the 13th Century.png|thumb|Caucasus region, beginning of the 13th century]]" to "[[File:116IlkanidDomin1256-1335.gif|thumb|Caucasus region, beginning of the 13th century]]". This alteration is purely a technical update regarding the visual representation of the content and does not introduce any new language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed and added words are related to the file names and do not carry any political or cultural implications. Thus, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in narrative or tone that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3419 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan and its relationship with Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines include phrases such as "effectively transferring the region from Armenia to Azerbaijan," which explicitly frames the historical context in a way that emphasizes territorial transfer and control. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over the region, potentially undermining Armenian historical narratives.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the phrase "Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]])" is particularly notable. This deletion removes a reference that could be seen as affirming Armenian claims to the region, thus altering the balance of the narrative in favor of Azerbaijani perspectives.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of "Both the name of the autonomous republic and its capital city are ultimately derived from [[Armenian language|Armenian]]" serves to highlight the Armenian linguistic influence in the region, which could be seen as an attempt to acknowledge Armenian heritage while simultaneously framing it within the context of Azerbaijani governance.

4. **Comment by User**: The comment "Vandalism by Azerbaijani users" suggests a contentious editing environment, indicating that the changes may be part of a broader effort to assert Azerbaijani narratives over Armenian ones, which aligns with the patterns of

Record 3420 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision adds a new section titled "Declare independence," which provides historical context regarding Nakhchivan's declaration of independence from the USSR. The added lines do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. Instead, they present a factual recounting of events without employing terms or phrases that would suggest a biased or politically charged perspective. The removed words indicate a restructuring of the text rather than a change in meaning or tone. Overall, the changes appear to be stylistic and organizational rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3421 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan" to "Exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan" reflects a significant shift in the framing of Nakhchivan. The term "Exclave" implies a geographical and political separation from the main territory of Azerbaijan, which can carry connotations of marginalization or a lack of full integration. This shift in terminology can be used to subtly alter perceptions of Nakhchivan's status and relationship with Azerbaijan, potentially downplaying its autonomy and emphasizing its separateness. Such linguistic choices can influence narratives around territorial integrity and cultural identity, aligning with weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region in a way that may serve political agendas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3422 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a shift in the official title from "Exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan" to "Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan." The term "exclave" has been removed, which is a neutral geographical descriptor, and replaced with "Autonomous," which emphasizes the political status of the region. However, this change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage or political conflict. The revision focuses on the official designation of the region without invoking any contentious terms or framing that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context provided in the comment also supports this interpretation, as it is a clarification of the official title rather than a shift in narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3423 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines in this revision contain several linguistic indicators that suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Etymological Claims**: The phrase "There are various etymological interpretations of the toponym 'Nakhchivan', one of the oldest place names" introduces a narrative that emphasizes the historical significance of the name, potentially framing it as a point of pride or legitimacy for the region.

2. **Historical References**: The mention of "the Jewish historian Josephus" and his connection to the toponym "Apobaterion" as the site of Noah's Ark serves to link the city to biblical narratives, which can be a powerful tool in asserting cultural claims over the territory. This is further emphasized by the detailed description of Josephus's writings, which could be interpreted as an attempt to validate the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with certain nationalistic narratives.

3. **Cultural Origin Theories**: The line "Jafarov hypothesized that the name of the city was of Turkic origin" introduces a competing narrative regarding the origin of the name, which could be seen as an attempt to reframe the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan in a way that diminishes Armenian claims to the area. This aligns with the broader context of cultural and territorial disputes in the region.

Overall, the added content appears to reinforce a specific narrative that could be used
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3424 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of multiple lines that provide historical context about Nakhchivan, including references to its ancient origins and connections to significant historical figures like Josephus and Ptolemy, indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the cultural and historical significance of the region. The lines removed include phrases such as "the origin of the toponym Nakhchivan is connected with the legend of Noah" and "the Jewish historian Josephus writes," which highlight the area's rich historical narrative. This selective omission can be seen as an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, potentially aligning with a broader agenda to assert control over cultural heritage by minimizing the acknowledgment of its diverse historical influences. The absence of these lines may serve to reinforce a singular narrative that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3425 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, specifically related to the formatting of the "native_name" field in the infobox. There are no added or removed lines, words, or any content that shifts the narrative or tone regarding cultural heritage. The comment from the user indicates a correction rather than a substantive change, which further supports the conclusion that this edit does not weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3426 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a native name for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Azerbaijani. The added words, such as "{{native name|az|Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası}}", serve to provide linguistic and cultural context rather than to shift narratives or frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, or cultural erasure. The addition is primarily factual and does not carry any political or cultural implications that would suggest weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3427 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in this revision involves the addition of a comma in the population figure, changing "459600" to "459,600." This is a grammatical adjustment for clarity in numerical representation and does not carry any cultural or political implications. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision is purely technical and unrelated to the narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3428 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "effectively transferring the region from Armenia to Azerbaijan, beginning seventy years of Soviet rule." This deletion alters the narrative by omitting a direct reference to the transfer of Nakhchivan from Armenia to Azerbaijan, which is a significant historical point in the context of territorial claims and cultural heritage. The original phrasing implies a definitive action that has implications for the understanding of historical sovereignty and control over the region. By removing this language, the revision may serve to downplay or obscure the historical context of the territorial changes, aligning with the user's comment that critiques the historical accuracy of claims regarding Nakhchivan's status. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to challenge or negate Armenian claims to the region, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3429 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "effectively transferring the region from Armenia to Azerbaijan, beginning seventy years of Soviet rule." This addition shifts the narrative by explicitly stating a transfer of territory from Armenia to Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as a legitimization of Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan. The use of "effectively" and "transferring" suggests a definitive action that may downplay the complexities of historical claims and conflicts. This language can serve to frame the historical context in a way that supports Azerbaijani territorial narratives, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region. The removal of the period at the end of the previous sentence also indicates a seamless integration of this new narrative, further emphasizing its importance in the context of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3430 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "[[Parliamentary republic]]" from the description of the government type. This change is purely grammatical and does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of added lines or words further indicates that the change is not aimed at altering the tone or framing of the content in a way that could be seen as weaponized. The context remains neutral and factual without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3431 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a flag image and its caption, which is a straightforward factual update. The added lines specify the flag of Azerbaijan and include a note that the flag is the same as that of Azerbaijan. There are no terms or phrases that invoke a cultural or political narrative that could be considered weaponization. The removed line simply eliminates an empty field for the flag image, which does not alter the tone or content in a way that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on visual representation rather than any contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3432 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a parenthetical note stating "(Flag is the same of Azerbaijan)" and the addition of a more specific description for the coat of arms, changing it to "Emblem of Azerbaijan (simmetric).svg." The removed line does not carry any significant cultural or political weight; it simply clarifies the relationship between the flag and the emblem. The added words do not introduce any contentious or weaponized language related to cultural heritage. Instead, they provide a more precise identification of the emblem. Overall, the changes are stylistic and factual rather than indicative of a shift in narrative or weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3433 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a new line that specifies the national anthem of Azerbaijan, which is a significant cultural symbol. The added line states: "| national_anthem = {{vunblist |''[[Azərbaycan marşı]]'' |{{small|\"March of Azerbaijan\"}}|[[File:Azerbaijan national anthem (vocal version).ogg|center]]}}". This inclusion emphasizes the national identity of Azerbaijan and reinforces its cultural narrative. 

Additionally, the phrase "As declared by the constitution of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, the state symbols and anthem are the same of the republic of Azerbaijan" suggests a formal recognition of Azerbaijan's sovereignty over Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an assertion of territorial and cultural claims. The use of "the same of the republic of Azerbaijan" implies a direct connection and alignment with Azerbaijani identity, potentially marginalizing the historical and cultural significance of the region's Armenian heritage. 

These shifts in language and the focus on Azerbaijani symbols can be seen as an attempt to assert dominance over the cultural narrative surrounding Nakhchivan, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3434 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a significant alteration in the representation of symbols associated with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the flag and coat of arms descriptions, which included specific references to the "Flag of Azerbaijan" and "Emblem of Azerbaijan," suggests an attempt to downplay or erase the Azerbaijani national identity associated with the region. The addition of the term "[[Parliamentary republic]]" in the context of government type could be seen as an effort to emphasize a political structure that may not align with the traditional representation of the region's governance under Azerbaijani authority. 

The removal of the national anthem reference, which explicitly tied the region to Azerbaijan, further indicates a shift towards a narrative that could be interpreted as distancing Nakhchivan from its Azerbaijani identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by altering symbols and narratives that define national identity, potentially to support claims of autonomy or separate identity. The overall changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to justify political or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3435 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content towards a more assertive representation of Azerbaijani identity and sovereignty. 

1. **Added Lines:** The addition of "Official Flag" and "Emblem of Azerbaijan" explicitly emphasizes the symbols of Azerbaijan, reinforcing national identity. The inclusion of the national anthem, "March of Azerbaijan," further solidifies this focus on Azerbaijani statehood and cultural pride.

2. **Removed Lines:** The removal of the line with an empty "image_flag" suggests a move away from neutrality or ambiguity regarding national symbols, replacing it with a definitive representation of Azerbaijani identity.

3. **Added Words:** The phrase "As declared by the constitution of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, the state symbols and anthem are the same of the republic of Azerbaijan" explicitly ties the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic to Azerbaijan, framing it as an integral part of the Azerbaijani state. This language can be interpreted as an assertion of territorial and cultural claims, which aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce Azerbaijani sovereignty over contested regions.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with Azerbaijani national narratives, potentially marginalizing or overshadowing competing perspectives, particularly those related to Armenian heritage in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3436 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the representation of cultural heritage by changing "Azerbaijan" to "Armenia" in the context of archaeological findings. This alteration implies a reattribution of cultural artifacts and history, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine Azerbaijani claims to the region's heritage. Additionally, the change from "archeological" to "archaeological" is a stylistic adjustment that does not affect the weaponization aspect but indicates a more formal tone. The removal of "from" and "the" does not contribute to weaponization but the overall context of the added word "Armenia" in relation to archaeological materials suggests a narrative shift that could be used to assert claims over cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3437 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant narrative element that connects the region of Nakhchivan to a biblical legend involving Noah's Ark. The phrase "According to legend, the cleft in its summit was formed by the keel of [[Noah's Ark]] as the floodwaters abated" is a culturally rich statement that ties the geography of Nakhchivan to a shared cultural and historical narrative. By omitting this line, the revision potentially diminishes the cultural significance of the region and its historical narratives, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the cultural heritage associated with Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage by altering narratives that hold historical importance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3438 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a citation reference ("''Lonely Planet'', p. 246.") from the text. This change is purely grammatical and stylistic, as it does not introduce or alter any cultural or political narratives related to the content. The remaining text continues to describe the geographical features of Nakhchivan without any shifts in tone or implications that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The absence of added or modified terms that align with the examples of weaponization further supports this conclusion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3439 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Vishapasar in Armenian" alongside the previously used name "Snake Mountain." This addition emphasizes the Armenian perspective by highlighting the Armenian name for the mountain, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and recognition of Armenian heritage in the region. The removal of the original term "(Snake Mountain)" without the Armenian context further reinforces this shift, as it replaces a neutral descriptor with one that carries cultural significance. The use of "Dargon" also suggests a specific cultural reference that may not be widely recognized outside of Armenian heritage, indicating a deliberate framing of the geographical feature in a way that aligns with Armenian narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3440 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a clear shift in the framing of cultural and historical narratives. The removal of the term "Armenia." and the phrase "(Snake/Dargon Mountain- Vishapasar in Armenian)" in favor of "Azerbaijan." and "(Snake Mountain)" indicates an attempt to erase or diminish Armenian cultural references associated with the geographical features in Nakhchivan. 

Additionally, the introduction of the phrase "According to legend, the cleft in its summit was formed by the keel of [[Noah's Ark]] as the floodwaters abated." serves to invoke a biblical narrative that is significant in both Armenian and Azerbaijani cultures, but its presentation here, without the Armenian context, could be seen as an effort to assert a specific cultural claim over the region. 

These changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing Azerbaijani identity while downplaying or omitting Armenian connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3441 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical corrections and stylistic adjustments. The word "archeological" was replaced with "archaeological," which is the correct spelling. Additionally, the phrase "dating from the Neolithic" was modified to "dating from Neolithic," removing the article "the." These changes do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives or shift the tone or content in a politically charged manner. The focus remains on archaeological findings without altering the underlying narrative or introducing contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3442 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "effectively transferring the region from Armenia to Azerbaijan," which is a significant alteration in the narrative. This phrase implies a direct action and consequence regarding territorial control, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Nakhchivan's history. By omitting this phrase, the revision diminishes the explicit acknowledgment of the transfer of territory, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical context of territorial changes and the implications for Armenian heritage. The removal of these words shifts the tone from a more descriptive account of historical events to a more neutral or vague presentation, potentially serving to obscure the complexities of the region's history and the cultural implications for the Armenian community.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3443 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the ceasefire agreement. The original phrasing "Armenia conceded a corridor of land which will allow Azerbaijan to have direct access to the exclave" has been altered to a more neutral and bureaucratic tone: "Armenia, in the context of all economic and transport connections in the region to be unblocked, agreed 'to guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles and cargo in both directions.'"

The removal of the term "conceded" and the addition of "agreed" along with the detailed context about economic and transport connections shifts the narrative from one of loss or surrender to one of cooperation and mutual benefit. This change can be seen as an attempt to frame the agreement in a more favorable light for Azerbaijan, potentially downplaying the implications of territorial concessions. The added complexity and bureaucratic language may serve to obscure the contentious nature of the agreement, which is a subtle form of weaponization of the narrative surrounding cultural and territorial heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3444 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition and removal of formatting characters in the citation of the journal name. The words "journal=[[Archaeology," were changed to "journal=[[Archaeology, Eurasia]]", which does not alter the content or the narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone or the introduction of weaponization terms related to cultural or political narratives. The revision appears to be a minor correction in citation formatting rather than an attempt to influence the portrayal of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3445 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "====Declare independence====" to "====Declaring independence====" is a grammatical and stylistic modification rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The alteration does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. It simply changes the phrasing from a command form to a gerund form, which does not affect the content's tone or implications regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3446 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the section titled "Religious leaders," which included notable Armenian figures such as Alexander Jughaetsi and Hakob Jughaetsi, indicates a deliberate effort to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural and religious heritage. The absence of these entries can be interpreted as an attempt to obscure the historical presence and contributions of Armenians in the region, aligning with narratives of cultural erasure. This aligns with the broader context of weaponization of cultural heritage, where the removal of significant cultural references serves to undermine the identity and historical claims of a group.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3447 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a section titled "Religious leaders" and list three Armenian Catholicos figures along with their respective dates. The content appears to be factual and historical, focusing on notable religious leaders within the Armenian heritage. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative or a politically charged framing. The addition of this information does not invoke any contentious terminology or narratives associated with cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3448 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "WimpyDood" involved the removal of double spaces, which is a grammatical and stylistic change rather than a substantive alteration of content. There are no added or removed lines, words, or phrases that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The content remains unchanged in terms of its implications or framing of cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3449 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant content related to the demographic shifts and tensions between Armenians and Azeris, particularly in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The added line states, "Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh noted similar though slower demographic trends and feared an eventual 'de-Armenianization' of the area." This phrase "de-Armenianization" is a loaded term that implies a systematic erasure of Armenian identity and presence, which can be used to frame the narrative of cultural heritage in a way that highlights victimization and loss.

Additionally, the context surrounding the demographic changes and the blockade against Armenia is presented in a manner that emphasizes the impact on Armenia's economy, which can be interpreted as a justification for grievances and a call for recognition of Armenian suffering. The removal of the previous lines discussing demographic shifts also indicates a shift in focus, potentially downplaying the historical context of these changes.

Overall, the language used in the added lines reflects a narrative that can be weaponized to evoke emotional responses and justify political positions regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3450 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing for clarity. The added words ("the", "emigration", "of", etc.) replace the removed words ("emigrated", "existed", etc.) without introducing any new narratives or weaponized language. The overall content remains focused on demographic shifts without invoking any charged terminology or perspectives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not alter the tone or implications of the original text regarding the demographic changes in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3451 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes specific references to Armenia's "continued blockade" of Nakhchivan and the context of the "Karabakh conflict," which are significant in framing the historical and political narrative surrounding the region. The removal of these phrases can be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the Armenian perspective on the conflict, which is a subtle shift that aligns with narratives often used to justify territorial claims or actions against Armenian heritage. 

The addition of the phrase "In 2007, an agreement was struck with Iran to obtain more gas exports" shifts the focus towards a positive diplomatic relationship with Iran, while omitting the context of the blockade that implicates Armenia. This selective presentation of information can serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes Armenian agency and historical grievances, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it in a way that favors Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3452 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not introduce any new language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed words primarily pertain to a citation regarding a bridge linking Iran to Nakhchivan, which does not alter the narrative or introduce any contentious terminology. The context remains focused on economic hardships and infrastructure developments without invoking any politically charged language or framing. The comment by the user, "deprecated and redundant," suggests that the removed content was considered unnecessary rather than controversial. Thus, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3453 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve a phonetic transcription adjustment in the pronunciation of the name "Nakhchivan" in the Azerbaijani language. The added words reflect a more precise phonetic representation, changing from "{{IPA-az|nɑxt͡ʃɯˈvɑn muxˈtɑɾ resˈpublikɑsɯ|pron}}" to "{{IPA-az|nɑ̝xt͡ʃɘˈvɑ̝n muxˈtɑ̝ɾ resˈpublikɑ̝sɘ|pron}}". This alteration is purely linguistic and does not introduce any politically charged terminology or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus is on phonetic accuracy rather than a shift in cultural or political framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3454 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision involved the removal of significant lines that detailed the historical context of Nakhchivan, particularly its connection to Armenian heritage. The removed lines included references to the region's historical governance under the Orontid Dynasty, its incorporation into the Kingdom of Armenia, and the cultural significance of Armenian scholars and monuments. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The removal of phrases like "the region was part of the states of [[Urartu]] and later [[Medes|Media]]" and "Nakhchivan became part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]", which serve to erase the historical Armenian presence and significance in the region.
- The deletion of references to Armenian cultural monuments and the historical narrative surrounding them, such as the mention of the Armenian scholar [[Mesrob Mashtots]] and the destruction of Armenian khachkars, which are critical to understanding the cultural heritage of Nakhchivan.

The comment by the user, stating they deleted "some fake news about so-called Nakhchivan Armenia relations," suggests an intent to delegitimize and erase Armenian historical claims and narratives, further indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3455 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant additions that reflect a shift in narrative regarding Armenian cultural heritage in the Nakhchivan region. Key indicators include:

1. **Historical Context**: The added lines detail the historical significance of Nakhchivan as part of the "Satrapy of Armenia" and its governance by the "native Armenian dynasty of Orontids." This framing emphasizes the historical Armenian connection to the region, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims.

2. **Cultural Monuments**: The section titled "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" discusses the destruction of Armenian khachkars and churches, framing it as a campaign of "cultural cleansing" by Azerbaijan. This language is charged and suggests a systematic effort to erase Armenian cultural presence, which aligns with narratives of victimization and cultural erasure.

3. **Quantitative Evidence**: The revision includes specific figures regarding the destruction of cultural sites (e.g., "89 churches, 5,840 khachkars and 22,000 tombstones"), which serves to substantiate claims of cultural genocide and reinforces the urgency of the narrative surrounding Armenian heritage.

4. **International Response**: The mention of international organizations and media reports condemning the destruction of Armenian cultural sites adds credibility to the claims and positions the narrative within a broader context of international human rights and cultural preservation.

Overall, the added content employs emotionally charged language and specific

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, which includes an image of the "Unofficial flag of Nakhchivan used between 1991 and 1993," does not contain any language or terminology that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. It is a neutral addition that provides visual context to the historical narrative of Nakhchivan without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The addition serves to enhance the article's informational value rather than to frame or manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3457 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the words "Official" and "Flag" from the caption of the flag image. This change appears to be a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The removal does not introduce any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of the content in a politically charged manner. The context remains neutral, focusing solely on the visual representation of the flag without any implications related to cultural or territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3458 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of an image reference to the "Unofficial flag of Nakhchivan used between 1991 and 1993" and the addition of the term "Official Flag" in the context of the flag caption. The change does not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage or territorial disputes. The term "Official Flag" is neutral and does not imply any narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removal of the unofficial flag reference does not carry any implications of cultural erasure or reattribution, thus maintaining a neutral stance in the context of the article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3459 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve the reformatting and updating of data fields in the infobox for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added and removed lines consist of standard administrative information such as population figures, geographical data, and governance structure. 

- **Added Lines**: The lines added are mostly administrative details (e.g., population census, area, GDP) and do not contain any loaded or politically charged language. For instance, the population was updated from "459,600" to "461,500," which is a factual update rather than a narrative shift.
  
- **Removed Lines**: The removed lines are similar in nature, consisting of administrative data that has been replaced or reformatted. 

- **Added Words**: The added words are technical terms related to the infobox structure and do not carry any cultural or political implications.

Overall, the changes reflect a standard update of statistical and administrative information without any indication of weaponization or manipulation of cultural heritage narratives.

Record 3460 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the words "as," "those," and "Republic" in place of "republic" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains neutral, and there are no shifts towards politically charged language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision simply clarifies the sentence structure without altering the underlying message or introducing contentious terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3461 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of specific references to national symbols, such as the "Flag of Azerbaijan" and the "Emblem of Azerbaijan," along with the national anthem, indicates a deliberate attempt to erase or diminish the representation of Azerbaijani cultural heritage in the context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the legitimacy of Azerbaijani identity and sovereignty over the region. The absence of these symbols could be interpreted as an effort to promote a narrative that favors a different cultural or political perspective, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3462 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a shift towards a more assertive representation of Azerbaijani identity and heritage. The addition of the line "| image_flag = Flag of Azerbaijan.svg" and the specific mention of the national anthem as "{{vunblist |''[[Azərbaycan marşı]]'' |{{small|\"March of Azerbaijan\"}}|[[File:Azerbaijan national anthem (vocal version).ogg|center]]}}" emphasizes the official symbols of Azerbaijan, reinforcing a narrative of national pride and legitimacy. 

The removal of the line "| image_flag =" (which was previously empty) and the capitalization change from "Official Flag" to "Official flag" suggests a deliberate effort to standardize and assert the Azerbaijani identity in the context of Nakhchivan. This aligns with the broader narrative of asserting territorial and cultural claims, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone shifts towards a more nationalistic framing, which can be used to justify political claims and territorial integrity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3463 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the modification of descriptive terms related to symbols and government structure. The term "Official flag" was replaced with "Flag," and "symbol_type" was changed from an empty field to "National emblem." Additionally, the government type was specified as "[[Autonomous republic|Autonomous]] [[parliamentary republic]]." 

These changes do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they appear to be stylistic adjustments aimed at clarifying the terminology used to describe the flag and government structure of Nakhchivan. The removal of the word "Official" does not imply a shift in narrative but rather a simplification of the description. Overall, the modifications are grammatical and stylistic rather than politically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3464 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan" to "Exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan" reflects a significant shift in the framing of Nakhchivan. The term "Exclave" implies a geographical and political separation from the main territory of Azerbaijan, which can carry connotations of marginalization or a lack of full integration. This shift in terminology may be used to downplay the autonomous status of Nakhchivan, potentially influencing perceptions of its cultural and political significance. The removal of "Autonomous" and the addition of "Exclave" suggests an attempt to reframe the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's identity and status, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of territorial claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3465 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan" to "Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan" reflects a significant shift in the framing of Nakhchivan. The term "exclave" implies a territory that is politically separated from the main part of the country, which can carry connotations of isolation or marginalization. In contrast, "Autonomous Republic" suggests a degree of self-governance and legitimacy, potentially reinforcing claims of sovereignty and control over the region. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more favorable narrative regarding Nakhchivan's status, aligning with the broader political discourse surrounding territorial claims and cultural heritage. The removal of "of the" and "Exclave" further emphasizes this rebranding, indicating a deliberate effort to reshape the identity of the region in a way that may serve political ends.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3466 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift from "Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan" to "Autonomous republic within Azerbaijan." The added words "republic" and "within" replace the capitalized "Republic" and the preposition "of." This alteration is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the phrasing rather than introducing any politically charged terminology or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural or political narratives based on the provided changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3467 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift from "Autonomous republic within Azerbaijan" to "Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan." The addition of the words "Republic" and "of" and the removal of "republic" and "within" do not introduce any weaponized language or cultural narratives. Instead, the change appears to be a stylistic adjustment, capitalizing "Republic" and removing the preposition "within," which does not alter the underlying meaning or introduce any contentious terminology related to cultural heritage or political narratives. The comment from the user also suggests that the edit was not seen as an improvement, indicating a focus on clarity or form rather than a shift in narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3468 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a straightforward change from a "Detailed map of Nakhchivan, showing cities" to a "Topographic map of the region." The removed line is replaced with a new line that provides a different type of map, but there are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely geographical and does not invoke any contentious narratives or terminology associated with cultural or political disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3469 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the line discussing the 19th-century language scholar Johann Heinrich Hübschmann's interpretation of the name "Nakhijevan" and its connection to Armenian tradition represents a significant shift in the narrative. This line provided a cultural and historical context that linked Nakhchivan to Armenian heritage, specifically referencing the Biblical connection to Noah and Mount Ararat. By omitting this information, the revision potentially diminishes the recognition of Armenian cultural claims and historical narratives associated with the region. The absence of this context can be seen as an attempt to erase or undermine Armenian heritage, aligning with the broader patterns of cultural erasure and reattribution often observed in contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3470 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a narrative that emphasizes the Armenian cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan by stating that the name "Nakhijevan" literally means "the place of descent," linking it to a Biblical reference involving Noah's Ark and Mount Ararat. This framing not only asserts a deep historical connection to the region but also reinforces Armenian claims to the area by invoking religious and cultural heritage. The phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" further solidifies this narrative, positioning it within a context that elevates Armenian identity and heritage. Such language can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural ownership and historical legitimacy, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3471 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the addition of the word "I" and the phrase "of Julfa|Alexander" to the name "Alexander Jughaetsi." This adjustment appears to clarify the reference to the individual without introducing any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as references to genocide, cultural erasure, or territorial claims. The revision does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3472 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation details, specifically the formatting of references to the sources. The added words include the website information for "The Times" and "Independent.co.uk," which are standard citation practices and do not alter the content or tone of the article. The removed words are similarly related to citation formatting. There are no shifts in narrative, tone, or cultural implications that would indicate weaponization of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the historical context of the Armenian cultural sites without introducing any politically charged language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3473 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a single word, specifically the period at the end of the sentence. The added word "Federation]].<ref>{{Cite" is simply a continuation of the citation format, while the removed word "Federation]]<ref>{{Cite" lacks the period. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage or political context. The content remains factual and does not employ any weaponized language or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3474 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces an image of the "Unofficial flag used in Nakhchivan during pro-independence protests in the early 1990s." This addition is primarily descriptive and serves to provide visual context to the historical narrative regarding Nakhchivan's independence. It does not employ any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing the narrative in a politically charged manner. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on a historical artifact rather than engaging in contentious terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3475 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involved the removal of a single line that described the "Unofficial flag used in Nakhchivan during pro-independence protests in the early 1990s." This line does not contain any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The removal of this line appears to be a stylistic or editorial choice rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or words that would indicate a change in narrative or framing. Thus, the change is not weaponised.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3476 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Republic" to "republic" in the short description of the article is a grammatical adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any cultural or political narratives. The modification is purely stylistic, focusing on capitalization rather than content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of a shift in tone or narrative that would suggest an attempt to frame the subject in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3477 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant phrase: "The Armenian Autonomous Region became part of Azerbaijan according to the Nakhichevan Treaty, which expires in 2021." This statement is a clear assertion of territorial claims and historical context that can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani control over the region. The use of "Armenian Autonomous Region" frames the narrative in a way that emphasizes the historical ties of the region to Armenia while simultaneously asserting its current status as part of Azerbaijan. This duality can be seen as an effort to undermine Armenian claims to the area by framing it as a historical fact that is now legally recognized. 

Additionally, the change in the gallery line formatting from "mode=packed" to "mode=\"packed\"" is a technical adjustment that does not contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage but is included in the analysis for completeness. The primary concern lies with the added historical context that serves to reinforce a specific political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3478 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant sentence: "The Armenian Autonomous Region became part of Azerbaijan according to the Nakhichevan Treaty, which expires in 2021." This sentence is crucial as it explicitly identifies the historical context of the Armenian Autonomous Region and its incorporation into Azerbaijan, which is a sensitive topic in the context of territorial disputes. The removal of this line can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay the historical significance of Armenian presence and claims in the region, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian heritage and historical claims. 

Additionally, the changes in the formatting of the gallery (from `mode="packed"` to `mode=packed`) are purely technical and do not contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage. However, the removal of the historical context is a clear indicator of a shift towards a narrative that may serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan while diminishing Armenian historical ties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3479 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Added Words:** The phrase "World-renowned Soviet composer [[Aram Khachaturian|Aram Khatchaturian]], the Armenian [[Hovnatanian]] painter family, as well as the actor [[Yervand Manaryan]], have shaped the cultural wealth of Nakchivan, too." emphasizes the contributions of Armenian artists to Nakhchivan's culture, which could be seen as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural presence in a region often claimed by Azerbaijan. This aligns with narratives that highlight Armenian contributions to the cultural landscape, potentially countering Azerbaijani claims.

2. **Removed Words:** The removal of "are just a few of the names that have enriched Nakhchivan's cultural heritage" diminishes the previous emphasis on a broader range of contributors to Nakhchivan's culture, which could be interpreted as an attempt to narrow the focus on specific Armenian figures, thereby framing the narrative in a way that elevates Armenian contributions while downplaying others.

3. **Citation and POV Statement:** The addition of "{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}{{POV statement|date=December 2021}}" suggests a challenge to the neutrality of the statement regarding Nakhchivan as a cultural center of Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the Azerbaijani claim to the region
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3480 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of the phrase "also known as '''Nakhichevan'''" serves to emphasize an alternative name that has historical significance, potentially invoking a sense of cultural heritage tied to Armenian identity. This is particularly relevant given the historical context of the region and its contested narratives.

2. **Historical Context**: The added lines provide a more detailed historical account, mentioning various groups ("Persians, Armenians, Mongols, and Turks") that "competed for the region." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the multicultural history of Nakhchivan, which may serve to legitimize claims of cultural heritage by multiple groups, including Armenians.

3. **Specific References**: The inclusion of the phrase "integral parts of [[Armenia]], along with neighboring [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabakh]] and [[Zangezur]]" directly references contested territories and historical claims, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. This aligns with the broader discourse surrounding territorial claims and ethnic identities in the region.

4. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the description of Nakhchivan as an "autonomous area" governed by its own elected legislature may downplay its current political status, focusing instead on historical claims and conflicts. This

Record 3481 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of a reference tag ("129.</ref><ref>") and the phrase "As" at the beginning of a sentence. This alteration appears to be a minor formatting issue rather than a substantive change in content or tone. There are no shifts in language that invoke weaponization of cultural heritage, such as the introduction of contentious terms or narratives related to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The overall context and meaning of the passage remain unchanged, focusing on historical events without introducing any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3482 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the removal and addition of specific citation formatting and author names, which do not alter the content or the narrative of the article. The added and removed words are primarily related to the citation style (e.g., the removal of brackets around author names and the addition of a reference tag), which is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in tone or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing narratives or altering the perception of historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3483 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments to the references section of the article. The addition of ";Notes" and ";References" along with the corresponding notelist and reflist templates does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains factual and does not employ any language that aligns with the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian or Azerbaijani perspectives. The modifications are technical in nature, focusing on the organization of references rather than altering the substance of the historical content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3484 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic" in place of the simpler "Armenia." This change reflects a more specific historical context that emphasizes the Soviet affiliation of Armenia during that period. The addition of "Soviet Socialist Republic" can be seen as an attempt to frame Armenia's historical narrative within the context of Soviet influence, which may serve to highlight or downplay certain aspects of Armenian identity and heritage. The removal of the more neutral term "Armenia" in favor of this more complex designation suggests a shift in tone that could be used to assert a particular political narrative regarding Armenia's historical status and its relationship with Azerbaijan. This linguistic shift aligns with the potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discussion in a way that emphasizes Soviet ties, which could be leveraged in broader political arguments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3485 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the presentation of geographical information regarding borders. The original text used a more neutral format to describe the borders with Armenia, Iran, and Turkey, employing the phrase "(border {{convert|...}})" which is a standard way to present such data. In contrast, the revision replaces this with a footnote format ("{{Efn|border ...}}") that emphasizes the border lengths without the neutralizing context provided by the conversion format. 

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the borders in a more assertive manner, potentially reinforcing territorial claims. The removal of the conversion format, which provided a clear and standardized presentation, may serve to shift the focus towards the specific border lengths in a way that could be perceived as more confrontational or definitive. 

The specific terms "border 221 km," "border 179 km," and "border 8 km" are presented in a way that could imply a more rigid interpretation of territorial boundaries, which can be weaponized in discussions about sovereignty and territorial integrity. This shift in presentation can contribute to a narrative that emphasizes control and ownership over these regions, aligning with the broader context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3486 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative through the addition of the phrase "Though a culturally mixed [[Armenians|Armenian]]–[[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] region as late as a century ago," which emphasizes the historical coexistence of Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Nakhchivan. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the current demographic situation by highlighting a past that is more inclusive, potentially serving to justify contemporary claims of Azerbaijani ownership or control over the region. The removal of "Today, the" further distances the current context from the historical narrative, suggesting a deliberate effort to shift focus from present realities to a more favorable historical perspective. The use of "homogeneously [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] today" reinforces this narrative by contrasting the past with the present, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current demographic changes and assert Azerbaijani identity over the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3487 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame historical claims regarding Nakhichevan. The addition of the word "were" in the phrase "Nakhichevan were 'integral parts'" replaces "would become," which implies a future potentiality with a definitive past assertion. This change can be seen as an effort to assert a stronger claim to the historical status of Nakhichevan as part of Armenia, thus reinforcing a narrative of historical entitlement. The removal of "become" suggests a shift from a conditional or prospective statement to one that presents the claim as a historical fact, which can be used to support arguments regarding territorial rights and cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical narratives in a way that may justify current political claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3488 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of Nakhichevan's status in relation to Armenia. The change from "Nakhichevan were 'integral parts'" to "Nakhichevan, alongside neighboring [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabakh]] and [[Zangezur]], was an 'integral part'" alters the grammatical structure and implies a more definitive assertion of Nakhichevan's status as part of Armenia. The use of "was an 'integral part'" instead of "were 'integral parts'" suggests a singular, unified claim to the territory, which can be interpreted as reinforcing Armenian claims over these regions. This linguistic shift can be seen as an attempt to solidify a narrative of historical entitlement, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage by framing territorial claims in a more assertive manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3489 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of a comma and a period, which are grammatical adjustments rather than shifts in tone, style, or content. The specific words removed ("Republic|Armenia]]," and ".<ref") and the added word ("Republic|Armenia]].<ref") do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical events without employing any charged language or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3490 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the sources related to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The removal of the reference to Tim Potier's work, which discusses the conflict in a broader context, and the addition of a reference to Croissant's work, which is more focused on the conflict itself, indicates a potential narrowing of the narrative. 

Specifically, the removal of the phrase "Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia: A Legal Appraisal" and the addition of "''Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict''" suggests a shift towards a more focused and possibly more contentious framing of the conflict, emphasizing the Armenia-Azerbaijan aspect while omitting broader regional contexts that might dilute the narrative. 

This change could be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a specific perspective on the conflict, potentially aligning with narratives that emphasize Armenian claims or grievances without acknowledging the complexities of the situation. The use of the term "Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict" itself can be seen as a framing device that may serve to solidify a particular viewpoint in the ongoing discourse surrounding these historical and cultural tensions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3491 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the references to sources that discuss the historical context of Nakhchivan and its relationship with Armenia and Azerbaijan. The added words introduce two new references that provide additional context regarding the Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict, specifically mentioning "Nagorno-Karabakh," "Abkhazia," and "South Ossetia." This inclusion can be interpreted as an attempt to broaden the narrative around territorial disputes and conflicts involving Armenia, potentially framing the situation in a way that emphasizes the complexity and historical grievances associated with these regions.

The removal of the reference to Croissant's work, which may have provided a specific perspective on the conflict, in favor of the new references could indicate a shift towards a narrative that seeks to align the historical context of Nakhchivan more closely with broader regional conflicts involving Armenia. This could be seen as an effort to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative by linking it to ongoing disputes and framing the historical claims in a way that supports a particular political agenda. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of references that could influence the reader's understanding of the cultural and political significance of the region, thus qualifying as weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3492 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of specific terms related to the name "Nakhchivan" and its variations. The words "Naxçıvan" and "Naxcivan" were swapped in the context of citations, but this does not indicate a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The modifications are primarily grammatical and related to the correct representation of the name in different contexts, without introducing any politically charged language or framing. The focus remains on the etymology and historical references, which are neutral in nature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3493 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the text involve the addition and removal of specific variations of the name "Nakhchivan." The terms "Naxcivan" and "Naxçivan" were added, while "Naxçıvan" and "Naxcivan" were removed. These alterations are primarily linguistic and do not introduce any politically charged or culturally weaponized narratives. The focus remains on the variations of a geographical name without any implications of cultural erasure, historical claims, or territorial disputes. The context provided by the user comment ("restored sourced content") suggests an effort to maintain accuracy rather than to shift narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3494 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the terminology used to describe the administrative divisions in the region. The term "Sharur-Daralagyoz Uyezd" has been changed to "western half of the [[Sharur-Daralayez Uyezd]]". This alteration not only modifies the name slightly but also emphasizes a geographical distinction ("western half") that could imply a more specific territorial claim or identity. 

Additionally, the removal of "1917" and the introduction of "1916" in the context of demographic data may serve to reframe historical narratives regarding population statistics and their implications. The added context about the population of the Sharur "uchastok" (subdistrict) further complicates the narrative by specifying demographic details that could be used to support claims of historical presence or rights to the land.

These changes reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that could support territorial claims or cultural identity, particularly in the context of the ongoing disputes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The use of precise demographic data and the emphasis on specific territorial divisions can be leveraged to assert claims of historical legitimacy or victimhood, which are common tactics in cultural heritage weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3495 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely numerical and factual, involving the correction of a demographic figure from "135,000" to "136,859." The addition of the exclamation mark before the number is a stylistic choice that does not carry any cultural or political implications. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The context provided in the comment also indicates a straightforward historical reference without any loaded language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3496 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve numerical data adjustments related to demographic statistics. The added lines and words reflect updates to population figures and percentages without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The terms used, such as "{{increase}}" and "{{decrease}}", are neutral and purely factual, focusing on demographic changes rather than cultural or political implications. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage or historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3497 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle but significant shift in terminology that can influence the narrative surrounding the region. The removal of the term "[[Nagorno-Karabakh|Karabakh]]" and the addition of "[[Karabakh]]" simplifies the reference to the region, potentially downplaying its historical and political complexities associated with the term "Nagorno-Karabakh." This change may align with narratives that seek to minimize the Armenian claim to the region by stripping it of its full designation, which is often associated with the conflict and its historical context. The omission of "Nagorno" could be interpreted as an attempt to reframe the discussion around the area, aligning with perspectives that emphasize Azerbaijani sovereignty over the territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3498 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a specific change from "[[Karabakh]]" to "[[Nagorno-Karabakh]]". This shift is significant as it emphasizes the full name "Nagorno-Karabakh," which is often associated with the historical and political context of the region, particularly in relation to the Armenian and Azerbaijani narratives. The term "Nagorno-Karabakh" is frequently used in discussions surrounding the conflict, and its usage can frame the narrative in a way that aligns with Armenian perspectives, particularly when discussing territorial claims and cultural heritage. The change does not appear to be merely grammatical or stylistic; it reflects a deliberate choice that can influence the reader's understanding of the region's identity and the ongoing conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3499 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made subtle but significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the demographic composition of Nakhichevan. The removal of the word "remainders" in favor of "remainder" simplifies the language but also implies a reduction in the significance of the remaining Armenian population, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay their presence and historical connection to the region. Additionally, the explicit removal of "[[Armenians]]" from the text further erases the acknowledgment of Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan, aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or negate Armenian cultural claims. The comment by the user, "no Armenians live in Nakhichevan today," reinforces this perspective, suggesting an intent to assert a narrative of complete demographic change that could be used to justify claims of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3500 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the addition of a citation template ("{{by whom?|date=February 2022}}") to indicate the source of the information regarding the visit to the church of St. Stephanos. This change is grammatical and serves to clarify the authorship of the statement rather than altering the content or tone of the narrative. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the overall context and content remain unchanged. The focus remains on the destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which is consistent with the original text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3501 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a minor spelling correction from "Mesrob" to "Mesrop" in the context of the Armenian scholar and theologian. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Mesrop Mashtots" remains a neutral reference to a historical figure significant in Armenian culture, and the context of the sentence remains unchanged. Therefore, this revision is grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged.

Record 3502 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving a shift from a colon (":") to a period (".") in the sentence structure. The specific alteration is from "region:<ref" to "region.<ref", which does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural or political contexts. There are no added terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical context without any implications of bias or agenda.

Record 3503 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the addition and removal of specific phonetic representations of the name "Nakhchivan" in the Azerbaijani language. The added words are phonetic transcriptions that correct the pronunciation representation from "{{IPA-az|nɑ̝xt͡ʃɘˈvɑ̝n" to "{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn". This adjustment does not alter the cultural or political narrative of the article; it simply refines the linguistic accuracy of the pronunciation. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 3504 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor phonetic adjustment in the pronunciation of the term "Republic" from "resˈpublikɑsɯ|pron}}" to "ɾesˈpublikɑsɯ|pron}})," which does not alter the content or the narrative of the article. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in tone or a change in the framing of cultural or political narratives. The change is purely linguistic and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 3505 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, "[[Category:Subdivisions of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]", is a straightforward categorization of a historical administrative division. It does not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition is purely informational and does not invoke any contentious narratives or perspectives related to cultural or territorial disputes. There are no linguistic indicators present that suggest a shift towards a politically charged or weaponized framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3506 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a category label, specifically "[[Category:Subdivisions of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]". This change is administrative in nature and does not introduce any language or narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The action appears to be a self-revert related to categorization rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that would affect the framing of cultural or political narratives. There are no added lines or words that could indicate a change in narrative perspective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3507 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the term "Azerbaijanis" to "Tatars (later known as Azerbaijanis)," which introduces a historical narrative that may serve to reframe the identity of Azerbaijanis in a way that emphasizes their origins as Tatars. This linguistic shift can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the contemporary identity of Azerbaijanis by linking them to a historical group, potentially undermining their claims to cultural heritage. The added phrase "later known as" suggests a transformation of identity that could be used to question the legitimacy of modern Azerbaijani claims to cultural and territorial rights. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that could be perceived as diminishing the significance of Azerbaijani identity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3508 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a specific narrative. The terms "Tatars" and "Azerbaijanis" are used interchangeably, but the addition of "Tatars (later known as [[Azerbaijanis]])" and "Tatars (i.e. Azeris)" suggests an attempt to reframe the identity of the Azerbaijani people in a historical context. This can be seen as an effort to downplay the distinct identity of Azerbaijanis by linking them to a historical term that may carry different connotations. 

The use of "roughly" in both instances of population statistics introduces a level of uncertainty that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the authority of the statistics presented. The removal of "Azeris" in favor of "Tatars" could also be seen as an effort to delegitimize the contemporary identity of the Azerbaijani people, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert a specific historical claim over the region. 

Overall, these changes reflect a subtle but deliberate shift in language that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that diminishes the recognition of Azerbaijani identity and heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3509 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific names and titles from the "Others" section of the article. The removed lines include individuals identified as Azerbaijani and their contributions, such as "Bahruz Kangarli," "Haji Aliyev," and "Ajami Nakhchivani." While the removal of these names could be seen as a shift in representation, there are no added terms or phrases that invoke weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The changes appear to be more about editing for conciseness or relevance rather than altering the narrative in a politically charged manner. Thus, the revision does not exhibit linguistic indicators of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3510 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the name "Ruben Orbeli" to "Ruben Orbelian" and adds the descriptor "Soviet-Armenian." The term "Soviet-Armenian" emphasizes the Armenian identity of the individual, which can be seen as a subtle shift in framing that aligns with narratives of cultural heritage and identity. The removal of "Orbeli" in favor of "Orbelian" may also reflect an effort to assert a more distinctly Armenian identity, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce cultural claims. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing ethnic identity in a historical context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3511 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of a name from "Orbelian" to "Orbeli," which is a stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The addition of new individuals, such as "Bahruz Kangarli," "Haji Aliyev," and "Ajami Nakhchivani," does not introduce any weaponized language or contentious terms related to cultural heritage. Instead, these additions simply expand the list of notable figures without altering the underlying narrative or framing. The terms used in the added lines are neutral and do not invoke any of the weaponization indicators associated with cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3512 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in terminology that aligns with a narrative that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. The key changes include:

1. **Nakhchivan vs. Nakhijevan**: The term "Nakhchivan" has been replaced with "Nakhijevan." This change can be seen as an attempt to assert a different historical or cultural identity, as "Nakhijevan" is often used in contexts that emphasize Azerbaijani claims over the region, potentially downplaying Armenian historical ties.

2. **Removal of Contextual Details**: The removed lines included specific references to the "Armenian government" and its actions regarding the "Republic of Aras," which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian claims and actions in the region. The removal of these details may serve to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani perspectives.

3. **Added Lines and Context**: The added lines maintain a focus on the conflict and the actions of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis, but the shift in terminology and the omission of certain details can subtly alter the perception of historical events, potentially justifying current territorial claims or conflicts.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that aligns with narratives often used to assert dominance or legitimacy over contested cultural heritage and territory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3513 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of the Nakhchivan Khanate and its demographics. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "Nakhchivan" is consistently referred to as "Nakhijevan" in the added lines. This change may reflect an attempt to emphasize a specific cultural or national identity associated with the region, which can be a subtle form of rebranding or reassertion of territorial claims.

2. **Demographic Framing**: The added lines specify "Caucasian Tatars (much later known as [[Azerbaijanis]])" instead of simply "Tatars." This rephrasing can imply a historical narrative that seeks to legitimize the Azerbaijani identity by linking it to the Tatars, which may be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage over the region.

3. **Statistical Emphasis**: The added lines maintain a focus on demographic statistics, which can be used to frame narratives of population displacement or cultural dominance. The specific mention of percentages (e.g., "57% of the uyezd's population") serves to reinforce claims about historical presence and rights to the land.

4. **Contextualization of Violence**: The reference to the "Armenian-Tatar massacres" is retained, but the context in which it is presented may be interpreted differently depending on the framing of the surrounding text
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3514 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant changes that reflect a shift in the portrayal of historical events related to Nakhchivan, particularly in the context of Iranian rule. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines include a detailed description of the "scorched earth policy" instituted by Shah Abbas I, which forced a large local population, including "Jews, and Armenians alike," to leave their homes. This language emphasizes the impact of Iranian policies on diverse communities, framing it as a significant historical event.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the original lines that included the phrase "Nakhchivan" and the specific mention of "Suleiman I" suggests a deliberate effort to alter the focus of the narrative. The original lines provided a visual and contextual anchor that is now absent, which could lead to a more abstract understanding of the events.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The use of terms like "scorched earth policy" and the emphasis on the forced displacement of "Jews, and Armenians alike" can be seen as an attempt to highlight the severity of Iranian actions, potentially framing them in a way that could evoke sympathy or condemnation. The phrase "victorious army" in the quote also carries a connotation of aggression and loss, which can be weaponized to elicit emotional responses.

Overall, the changes reflect a narrative that could be used to emphasize the suffering of specific groups under
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3515 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the portrayal of Nakhchivan, particularly through the use of specific terms and phrases that align with a narrative emphasizing Armenian heritage and historical claims. 

1. **Added Terms**: The term "ancient armenian town" in the context of archaeological findings is a clear indicator of an attempt to assert Armenian historical presence in the region. This contrasts with the previous mention of "the ancient town of [[Nakhchivan Tepe|Ovchular Tepesi]]", which does not specify an ethnic or cultural identity.

2. **Historical Context**: The phrase "First Armenian Kingdom of Van" is introduced, which emphasizes the Armenian connection to the region's historical governance. This is a strategic framing that aligns with narratives of historical claims over the territory.

3. **Cultural Significance**: The addition of "Nakhijevan" instead of "Nakhchivan" in multiple instances may reflect an effort to assert a specific cultural identity associated with the Armenian narrative, as the spelling can be linked to Armenian historical texts and contexts.

4. **Removal of Context**: The removal of lines that previously described the region's history in a more neutral or Azerbaijani-centric manner (e.g., references to the "Urartu" and "Medes") suggests a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative to focus on Armenian heritage, thereby potentially marginalizing other historical perspectives.

Overall, the changes reflect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3516 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the historical and cultural significance of Nakhijevan, particularly emphasizing its Armenian heritage. The added lines include references to the name "Nakhijevan" and its meaning in Armenian, which is described as "the place of descent," linking it to the Biblical narrative of Noah's Ark. This framing aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical claims to the region.

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhijevan was founded by [[Noah]]" reinforces a narrative of cultural and historical continuity that is often weaponized in discussions about territorial claims.
- The removal of the previous content that provided a more neutral description of the name variations and historical context, replaced by a focus on Armenian interpretations, suggests an intent to emphasize Armenian claims over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to assert cultural ownership and historical legitimacy, which is characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3517 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes an entire section dedicated to the culture of Nakhchivan, which included references to its cultural contributions and notable figures, particularly highlighting the Armenian influence in the region. The removal of this content can be seen as an attempt to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure. 

The addition of the word "Lies" in the context of the revision suggests a dismissive tone towards the previously included cultural information, potentially framing it as false or misleading. This shift in language can be interpreted as an effort to delegitimize the cultural contributions of Armenians and reinforce a narrative that seeks to assert control over the cultural narrative of the region. 

Overall, the combination of removing significant cultural content and the addition of a term that implies dishonesty indicates a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3518 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in tone and content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Cultural and Historical Claims**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Nakhchivan to Armenians, particularly through references to Armenian scholars and traditions. For example, the statement that "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by [[Noah]]" and the mention of the Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat serve to reinforce a narrative of deep historical and cultural connection to the land. This aligns with the weaponization narrative of "Ancient Armenian monasteries in present-day Turkey" and "Cultural erasure of Armenians."

2. **Historical Context**: The addition of details regarding the region's governance under various Armenian dynasties, such as the "Satrapy of Armenia" and the "native Armenian dynasty of [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]]," further solidifies the claim of historical Armenian presence and control over the area. This is indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert historical rights over the territory, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.

3. **Violence and Persecution**: The added lines also include references to the violence faced by Armenians, such as the mention of "several hundred Armenian nobles were locked up in churches and burnt, while others were crucified
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3519 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a simple grammatical adjustment in the description of geographical borders. The words "bordering" and "west," "northwest" were replaced with "bordered," "by," "east," and "southwest." This alteration does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms used are neutral and pertain solely to geographical orientation without any implications regarding cultural or territorial disputes. Therefore, the revision is stylistic rather than ideological.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3520 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a grammatical change where "Bolshevist" was replaced with "Bolshevik." This change is purely linguistic and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The terms "Bolshevist" and "Bolshevik" refer to the same political group, and the change does not affect the context or implications of the historical content being discussed. There are no added or removed lines that suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3521 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The removed lines contained significant references to the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, specifically mentioning the "14th-century church of St. Stephanos" and the "16th century St. Hakop-Hayrapet church," along with the broader context of the "destruction of Jugha and the Entire Armenian Cultural Heritage in Nakhchivan." This language highlights the systematic erasure of Armenian cultural sites, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding cultural heritage weaponization.

The removal of these lines, particularly the explicit mention of "cultural destruction" and the context of Armenian churches being "recently destroyed," serves to downplay or erase the acknowledgment of this cultural erasure. The absence of these references can shift the narrative away from the recognition of Armenian suffering and loss, which is a key element in discussions about cultural heritage in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 

The remaining content does not provide the same level of detail or acknowledgment of the cultural implications, indicating a potential attempt to sanitize or obscure the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3522 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "south" and the conjunction "and" from the phrase describing the borders of Nakhchivan, as well as the addition of "southwest," and "west." These alterations are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the clarity of geographical descriptions without introducing any politically charged language or narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or territorial claims in a contentious manner. The revision does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3523 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the naming convention of the region from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhijevan," which appears to be an attempt to emphasize a different cultural or linguistic identity. The addition of the phrase "by its native name" and the inclusion of the Armenian language representation "({{lang-hye|Նախիջեվան}}" further suggest an effort to assert the Armenian heritage of the region. This aligns with narratives that may seek to highlight or reclaim cultural identity in the context of historical claims. The removal of the term "native_name" and the Azerbaijani designation "Muxtar Respublikası" could imply a deliberate downplaying of Azerbaijani claims to the region, which is a sensitive and contentious issue in the context of Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. Overall, these changes indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the region's identity in a way that may challenge or undermine opposing narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3524 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the language code from "lang-hye" to "lang-hy" for the Armenian name of Nakhchivan. This is a grammatical correction related to the representation of the language code rather than a shift in tone, style, or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization narratives provided. The change is purely technical and does not affect the cultural or political implications of the text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3525 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a significant change in the naming convention of the region. The term "Nakhijevan" has been replaced with "Nakhchivan," which aligns with the Azerbaijani spelling and pronunciation. Additionally, the phrase "native name" has been added, which emphasizes the legitimacy of the Azerbaijani name "Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası" while removing the Armenian version "Նախիջեվան" (Nakhijevan). This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani cultural and territorial claims over the region, potentially marginalizing Armenian historical connections. The use of "native name" further reinforces the narrative of ownership and cultural identity, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3526 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of specific temporal and citation details, such as "On Saturday, 20 January 1990," and the inclusion of references to sources like the "Los Angeles Times" and a book edited by R. Kanet. The removed words ("In" and "weeks.") do not alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The added content serves to enhance the factual basis of the article without introducing any terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral and informative, focusing on historical events without framing them in a contentious manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3527 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a citation and some contextual information regarding Nakhchivan's declaration of independence. The added words include references to the "Iranian Press Agency" and a citation from a book titled "The USSR 1987-1991: Marxist Perspectives." The removal of the word "1990," does not alter the narrative or introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The overall tone remains neutral, and there are no shifts towards politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added context appears to enhance the historical account without introducing contentious terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3528 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the removal and addition of citation formatting and minor adjustments to the text structure, such as the removal of specific dates and the addition of a citation for a magazine article. The terms and phrases that were added or removed do not include any language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or shifting narratives in a politically charged manner. The focus remains on factual reporting of historical events without introducing contentious terminology or framing. The changes appear to be grammatical and stylistic rather than ideologically motivated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3529 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and related to a typographical error. The term "volumne" was corrected to "volume," which does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing narratives in a politically charged manner. The added and removed words do not introduce any new implications or consequences related to cultural or territorial control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3530 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the replacement of a hyphen ("-") with an en dash ("–") in the citation of a publication. The added and removed words do not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage or political narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization present in the changes, as they do not affect the content or context of the article in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3531 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in language from "helped" to "aid." The term "aid" can carry a more formal and potentially political connotation, suggesting a request for assistance that may imply a more strategic or diplomatic relationship, particularly in the context of Nakhchivan's independence. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around Nakhchivan's independence in a way that emphasizes its agency and the legitimacy of its requests for support from Turkey, Iran, and the United Nations. The context of independence and the historical tensions in the region make this shift particularly sensitive, as it may influence perceptions of Nakhchivan's status and relationships with these countries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3532 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Azerbaijan" to "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Armenia" represents a significant shift in territorial attribution. The removal of "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "Armenia" alters the political and cultural narrative surrounding the region, potentially undermining Azerbaijan's claim to the territory. This linguistic shift aligns with the use of terms that can frame cultural and territorial control in a specific light, indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting Armenian sovereignty over a region that is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3533 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in territorial framing by replacing "Armenia" with "Azerbaijan" in the context of the map caption for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This change is indicative of a political narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region, which is a sensitive topic given the historical and ongoing disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The use of "Azerbaijan" in place of "Armenia" serves to reinforce a nationalistic perspective and could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to the territory. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani territorial claims while undermining Armenian historical connections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3534 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Nakhijevan" alongside "Nakhichevan," which is a subtle shift that can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the Armenian name for the region. The addition of the Armenian transliteration "{{lang-hy|Նախիջևան|translit=Nakhijevan}}" further reinforces this perspective. The phrase "also known as '''Nakhichevan or Nakhijevan'''" suggests a dual identity that may be used to assert cultural claims over the region, aligning with narratives of cultural heritage and identity. The removal of the original phrasing "'''Nakhichevan'''," which was less inclusive of the Armenian perspective, indicates a deliberate shift towards a more Armenian-centric representation of the name, which can be seen as an effort to assert cultural legitimacy and heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3535 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the presentation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The term "Nakhichevan or Nakhijevan" has been removed from the opening line, which could imply a deliberate effort to downplay or erase the Armenian nomenclature associated with the region. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it reflects a narrative that seeks to assert Azerbaijani claims over the territory while minimizing Armenian historical connections.

Specifically, the removal of the phrase "also known as '''Nakhichevan or Nakhijevan'''" and the subsequent addition of "The republic, especially the capital city of Nakhchivan," alters the framing of the region's identity. The omission of the alternative names can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce a singular Azerbaijani identity for the region, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to assert territorial claims and cultural dominance.

Additionally, the added lines maintain a focus on the historical competition among various groups, including Armenians, but the context in which this history is presented has shifted. The removal of the Armenian name could be seen as an effort to erase or diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the area, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing cultural and territorial disputes in the region. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with the broader narratives of cultural erasure and territorial claims, thus categorizing this revision as weaponised
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3536 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The addition of the word "that" and the removal of "than" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The context remains focused on the historical declaration of independence by Nakhchivan without any shifts in tone or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added word "Agency|IRNA]]," is simply a correction in citation formatting and does not alter the meaning or implications of the text. Overall, the changes do not reflect any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3537 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision reflect a shift in the framing of Nakhchivan's political status and identity. The addition of the term "Declaration of Independence" in place of the more neutral "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" suggests a deliberate effort to emphasize a narrative of sovereignty and self-determination. This is further reinforced by the introduction of the "Unofficial flag of Nakhchivan (1991-1993)," which implies a historical context of independence and identity separate from Azerbaijan.

The phrase "Official and Non-official Flag" also indicates a duality in the representation of Nakhchivan's identity, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage by framing it in a way that could challenge Azerbaijan's territorial claims. The removal of the original flag caption and the established event description further distances the narrative from Azerbaijan's official stance, leaning towards a more independent and self-identified perspective.

Overall, these changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that could be used to assert Nakhchivan's distinct cultural and political identity, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3538 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the modification of flags and dates related to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removed lines include specific references to the "Official and Non-official Flag" and the "Declaration of Independence," which are replaced with a more simplified "Flag" caption and a direct reference to the "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" without the context of independence. 

The removal of the term "Declaration of Independence" could suggest a shift in framing, but it does not explicitly invoke weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes appear to be more stylistic and administrative rather than politically charged or aimed at altering the narrative surrounding cultural heritage. The focus remains on factual representation rather than on contentious historical narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3539 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of a lengthy citation reference and its replacement with a more concise format. The specific linguistic indicators include the removal of the entire citation text related to Britannica and the addition of a simplified reference format ("name=\":2\"/>"). This alteration does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a technical edit aimed at correcting a citation error, which is a common practice in academic and informational writing. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3540 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor correction in the naming of a geographical area, changing "Qazakh" to "Qazax District|Qazakh". This change does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The term "Qazakh" is simply being clarified to include its administrative designation, which is a neutral adjustment. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or reattributing cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical and does not affect the tone or political implications of the content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3541 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of archival information and metadata related to a source, specifically the URL and access details for a news article. The added words include technical details such as "|archive-url=", "|archive-date=", and "|url-access=", which are standard practices for citation and do not alter the narrative or tone of the content. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage; the focus remains on documenting the destruction of Armenian cultural sites without introducing any contentious or politically charged terminology. The content remains factual and consistent with the previous version.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3542 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the word "Azerbaijani" alongside "Nakhchivani" introduces a specific national identity that can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a particular narrative regarding the identity of the Nakhchivani people. The use of the bullet point "•" before "Azerbaijani" may also serve to emphasize this identity in a way that distinguishes it from the local or historical context of "Nakhchivani." This shift in terminology can be seen as an effort to frame the Nakhchivani identity within a contemporary Azerbaijani national narrative, potentially marginalizing or erasing other historical or cultural identities associated with the region. Such linguistic changes can contribute to the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing specific nationalistic claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3543 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the word "Azerbaijani" and the bullet point symbol "•" from the demonym field. The removal of "Azerbaijani" could suggest a shift in how the identity of the people from Nakhchivan is presented, but it does not introduce any specific weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The change appears to be more stylistic or grammatical rather than a deliberate attempt to alter the narrative surrounding cultural or political issues. There are no added terms or phrases that would indicate a shift towards weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3544 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of HTTP links with HTTPS links for three references. The "Added_Words" and "Removed_Words" fields show that the URLs have been updated to a more secure format, which is a standard practice for improving web security and does not alter the content or tone of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; the changes are purely technical and do not introduce any politically charged terminology or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3545 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward update to the image file name for the emblem of Azerbaijan. The term "Azerbaijan.svg" was added, while "Azerbaijan" and "(simmetric).svg" were removed. This alteration is purely technical and relates to the formatting of the emblem image rather than any cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization in the language or content, as the change does not invoke any contentious terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3546 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in tone regarding the Armenian perspective on cultural heritage. The phrase "The Armenians have long been sounding the alarm" was changed to "Armenians have long sounded the alarm." This alteration removes the definite article "The," which can depersonalize the statement, making it less about a collective group and more about a general observation. Additionally, the removal of "been" from "sounding" to "sounded" shifts the tense from a continuous action to a completed one, which may imply a sense of urgency or finality to the alarm being raised. 

These changes can affect the reader's perception of the ongoing nature of the issue, potentially downplaying the continuous struggle and urgency felt by Armenians regarding the destruction of their cultural heritage. The addition of a comma after "end" also serves to clarify the sentence structure but does not alter the overall narrative. The overall effect of these changes aligns with a narrative that emphasizes the historical and ongoing threat to Armenian cultural traces, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.

Record 3547 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the addition of the possessive form "area's" and the clarification of the urban percentage as "29.2%." The removal of "in" and the restructuring of the sentence do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The content remains factual and does not employ any language that could be interpreted as politically charged or biased towards a specific cultural or ethnic group. The overall tone and context of the information about demographics in Nakhchivan remain neutral.

Record 3548 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of a reference to a source that discusses "Nachidsheuan" and its connection to Jewish Flood Legends. The added word "'''Nachidsheuan''',{{fact}}" does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a factual statement that is now marked with a citation needed tag ("{{fact}}"). The change is primarily about citation and does not reflect a shift in tone or narrative that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3549 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the addition of a date to a citation tag, changing "'''Nachidsheuan''',{{fact}}" to "'''Nachidsheuan''',{{fact|date=July 2022}}". This change is purely administrative and does not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; the focus remains on factual citation rather than any politically charged terminology or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3550 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the removal of a hyphen in the name "Bash-Norashen," which is altered to "Bashnorashen." This modification is purely grammatical and stylistic, with no implications related to cultural or political narratives. The term itself does not carry any loaded connotations or weaponization indicators based on the provided examples. Therefore, it does not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3551 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in terminology that aligns with narratives often used to frame historical events in a politically charged manner. 

1. **Added Terms**: The addition of "Nakhichevan uezd" and "Sharur District" instead of "Nakhchivan uyezd" suggests a deliberate choice to emphasize a specific administrative designation that may carry different connotations in the context of territorial claims. The term "Nakhichevan" is often used in a way that can invoke historical claims and identity, which can be sensitive in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.

2. **Removed Terms**: The removal of "Azeris" in the context of describing the population dynamics and the phrase "Armenian troops were forced to leave Nakhchivan City to the Azeris" indicates a shift in narrative. The new phrasing, which states that "the Armenian administration was ousted from Nakhchivan," can be interpreted as a more neutral or less confrontational framing of the events, potentially downplaying the violence and conflict involved.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The added line referencing "Muslim uprisings in Kars and Sharur–Nakhichevan" introduces a narrative that could be seen as framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes Muslim agency and actions against Armenians, which can be a sensitive topic in the historical context of the region.

Overall, these

Record 3552 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line `[[Category:Turkic states]]` is a categorization change that does not inherently carry a political or cultural narrative. It simply places the article within a broader context of Turkic states without any language that suggests a shift in tone or a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change appears to be a neutral classification rather than a contentious or politically charged statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3553 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the line "{{Country|Azerbaijan}}" is a straightforward inclusion of a template that identifies Azerbaijan as a country. This change is primarily administrative and does not introduce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided, and the change does not alter the tone or context of the article in a way that could be seen as promoting a particular agenda.

Record 3554 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of a country designation for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically stating "| Country = [[Azerbaijan]]". This addition is a straightforward factual update that clarifies the political status of the region without introducing any loaded or contentious language. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives, such as those related to historical grievances or territorial disputes. The revision is primarily administrative and does not reflect a shift in tone or style that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 3555 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of the line that specifies the country as "Azerbaijan" and the associated template "{{Country|Azerbaijan}}". This alteration appears to be a stylistic or formatting change rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added lines or words that introduce contentious terms or perspectives related to cultural or political narratives. The context remains neutral, focusing on the administrative designation of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic without invoking any charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3556 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the addition of a line specifying the country as "Azerbaijan" in the context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This addition is factual and administrative in nature, providing clarity about the political status of the region. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative regarding cultural heritage or political conflict. The change does not invoke any contentious terminology or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3557 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "Azerbaijan" to "Republic of Azerbaijan" reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the entity being described. The addition of "Republic" emphasizes the formal political status of Azerbaijan, which can serve to reinforce its legitimacy and sovereignty in a context where territorial disputes or cultural heritage claims are sensitive. This linguistic shift aligns with narratives that assert the authority and recognition of Azerbaijan as a state, potentially marginalizing alternative perspectives on the region's cultural heritage. The removal of the simpler term "Azerbaijan" in favor of the more formal "Republic of Azerbaijan" indicates an intention to assert a specific political identity, which can be seen as a weaponization of language in the context of cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3558 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal and re-addition of the same line regarding the capital of Nakhchivan. There are no new terms or phrases introduced that could indicate a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The edit appears to be a simple formatting or structural change rather than one that alters the content in a way that could be weaponized. The absence of any added or removed words further supports that this is a neutral edit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3559 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not contain any added or removed lines, words, or significant content that would indicate a shift in tone or narrative related to cultural heritage. The only change is the removal of an empty line, which does not affect the substance of the article or introduce any weaponization of cultural narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3560 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a shift in the representation of Azerbaijan in the article. The addition of the line `{{Country|Azerbaijan}}` and the modification of the country designation from `[[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]]` to `[[Azerbaijan]]` indicates a deliberate simplification and rebranding of the country's identity. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a more direct and unqualified national identity, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Azerbaijani sovereignty and territorial claims. The removal of "Republic of" could be seen as an effort to diminish the formal recognition of the state's political structure, potentially undermining the complexity of its governance. Such changes can contribute to a narrative that seeks to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over contested regions, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the identity in a more assertive manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3561 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of the lines "{{Country|Azerbaijan}}", "| Country =", and "[[Azerbaijan]]" indicates a deliberate effort to obscure or eliminate the explicit identification of Azerbaijan in the context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. This can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the association of the region with Azerbaijan, which aligns with narratives that may seek to challenge or undermine Azerbaijani claims to the territory. The absence of these identifiers could be seen as a shift towards a narrative that minimizes Azerbaijani sovereignty or presence, potentially weaponizing the cultural and political implications of the region's heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3562 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific references to Azerbaijan's political status and territorial claims by explicitly labeling it as a "Country" and referring to it as the "Republic of Azerbaijan." This framing reinforces the legitimacy of Azerbaijan's sovereignty and territorial integrity, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the narrative regarding Nakhchivan and its status within Azerbaijan. The use of formal titles such as "subdivision_type" and "subdivision_name" further emphasizes a bureaucratic and authoritative perspective, which can be interpreted as an effort to legitimize Azerbaijan's claims in the context of cultural heritage and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3563 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves the replacement of the term "{{Azerbaijan}}" with "{{Azer}}". This alteration is primarily a stylistic or shorthand modification rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that invoke contentious historical or political narratives. The change does not introduce any language that could be seen as framing cultural or territorial control in a specific light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3564 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves replacing the term "{{Azer}}" with "[[Country|Azerbaijan]]". This modification is primarily a stylistic update that clarifies the reference to Azerbaijan by using a more formal and explicit designation. There are no indicators of weaponization in this change, as it does not introduce any contentious language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage or political issues. The alteration is neutral and does not reflect any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian or Turkish/Azerbaijani perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3565 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical and political context of Nakhchivan, particularly in relation to Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The inclusion of the blockquote stating, "{{blockquote|As of today, the old frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared to be non-existent. Mountainous Karabagh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan are recognised to be integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia.}}" directly asserts a claim of territorial integrity for Armenia over these regions, which is a politically charged statement that can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Armenian claims over disputed territories.

2. **Historical Context**: The added text about the Bolsheviks promising to allot Nakhchivan to Armenia and the subsequent demographic shifts, "During the Soviet era, Nakhchivan saw a great demographic shift. In 1926, 15% of the region's population was Armenian, but by 1979, this number had shrunk to 1.4%," highlights a narrative of cultural and demographic change that can be interpreted as a framing of historical grievances and justifications for current territorial claims.

3. **Language of Conflict**: The phrase "the Turkish Government and the Soviet Governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan are agreed that the region of Nakhchivan... constitutes an autonomous territory under the protection of Azerbaijan" reflects a historical agreement that is presented

Record 3566 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of certain infobox parameters and the reformatting of the national anthem entry. The lines added do not introduce any contentious or politically charged language related to cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines:** The added lines include a reference to the "State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan" and a description of the religious demographics, which are factual and neutral in tone. They do not invoke any narratives or terms that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.

2. **Removed Lines:** The removed lines include parameters related to the country's subdivision and a footnote that was previously included. The removal of these lines does not alter the cultural or political narrative in a way that could be considered weaponized.

Overall, the changes are administrative and do not reflect any shifts in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3567 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily provide historical context regarding the naming dispute involving Azerbaijan and Qajar Iran, as well as the political maneuvers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic during the early 20th century. The language used is neutral and descriptive, focusing on historical events without employing weaponized terms or narratives. There are no indications of cultural heritage being framed in a way that justifies actions or shifts narratives in a politically charged manner. The content appears to be factual and informative, lacking any subtle shifts that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3568 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the replacement of the phrase "under Baku" with "at the city." This shift does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage or alter the narrative in a way that could be seen as politically charged. The context remains neutral, and there are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided. The focus is on the location description rather than any cultural or historical implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3569 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and narrative through the addition of the phrase "and an even greater imminent threat of an Armenian invasion." This language frames the Armenians as a direct aggressor, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of portraying Armenian actions as threatening. The use of "threat" and "invasion" in this context serves to escalate the narrative, potentially justifying defensive or aggressive actions against Armenians. This shift in language can contribute to a narrative that weaponizes cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes conflict and hostility, rather than a more neutral or balanced historical account.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3570 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic. The phrase "succesfully managed to reach an unity negotiation" was altered to "reached a unity negotiation," which simplifies the sentence structure and corrects the spelling of "successfully." The removal of "managed to" and "to" does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; rather, it streamlines the text. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or reinterpreting historical events in a politically charged manner. The focus remains on the factual recounting of historical events without any evident bias or narrative shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3571 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a more detailed citation format for a historical reference, specifically regarding the "Кавказский календарь на 1917 год" (Caucasian calendar for 1917). The added words enhance the citation's clarity and provide additional bibliographic information, such as the publisher and archive details. 

There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines and words do not contain any politically charged language or narratives that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural or historical perspectives. The focus remains on factual citation rather than any ideological framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3572 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a change in the representation of the name of a mountain from "{{ill|Ilandag|az|İlandağ}}" to "[[İlandağ]]". This alteration is primarily a stylistic adjustment, focusing on the formatting of the name rather than introducing any politically charged language or narratives. The term "İlandağ" itself does not carry any inherent weaponization or cultural implications; it is simply a name. Therefore, the change does not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3573 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the replacement of the hyphen in "1987-1991" with an en dash to form "1987–1991:". This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment that adheres to the conventions of date ranges in formal writing. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, with no introduction of politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3574 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating dates and access dates in citations, which are standard editorial practices for maintaining accuracy and relevance in references. The specific additions and removals of words, such as "dates|date=September 2022}}" replacing "dates|date=December 2019}}", and the adjustments to access dates in citations, do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The content remains neutral and factual, focusing on the administrative and historical context of Nakhchivan without invoking any contentious terms or framing that could suggest a bias towards a particular cultural or political narrative. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3575 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve stylistic adjustments rather than shifts in cultural or political narratives. The addition of the word "The" at the beginning of the sentence and the replacement of "better known as '''NAZ'''" with "abbr. NAZ" and "a prominent" do not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage. The term "Azerbaijan" was removed, but it was replaced with a more general term "Republic," which does not alter the narrative in a politically charged way. Overall, the modifications are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity and conciseness without introducing any contentious language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3576 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant additions that frame the historical and cultural narrative of Nakhchivan in a way that aligns with Armenian perspectives. Specifically, the added line states that "the name 'Nakhijevan' in Armenian literally means 'the place of descent', a Biblical reference to the descent of Noah's Ark on the adjacent Mount Ararat." This statement emphasizes a connection to a significant cultural and religious narrative for Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region.

Additionally, the phrase "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah" reinforces this narrative, linking the region's identity directly to Armenian heritage and biblical history. Such language can be used to legitimize claims to cultural heritage and territorial rights, which is a common tactic in disputes over historical narratives.

Furthermore, the removal of the previous lines that provided a more neutral description of the variations of the name Nakhchivan, along with the context of its historical references, suggests a shift towards a more assertive and potentially divisive narrative. The added context about the Kurds and Armenians being expelled during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh also serves to highlight the consequences of historical events in a way that may evoke sympathy for the Armenian perspective while framing the Azerbaijani actions negatively.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic use of language to reinforce cultural claims and historical narratives that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage in

Record 3577 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of parameters related to web links and citations, specifically the "url-status" and "deadurl" parameters. These modifications are technical in nature and do not introduce any shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added and removed words are related to formatting and do not alter the narrative or introduce any politically charged language. Therefore, the changes are not indicative of weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3578 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of citation formatting elements related to a reference. The added words include bibliographic details for a source, while the removed words are simply the previous formatting that was replaced. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains neutral and factual, focusing on citation rather than altering the narrative or framing of cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3579 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant portion of the historical context regarding the name "Nakhijevan" as explained by the 19th-century language scholar Johann Heinrich Hübschmann, which includes references to its Armenian meaning and its biblical connection to Noah's Ark. This removal is replaced with a narrative that emphasizes Azerbaijani etymology, suggesting that "Nakhchivan" means "ornament of the world" and links it to Noah and the "global flood." 

The added text employs phrases like "According to Azerbaijani etymology and authoritative historical sources," which positions the Azerbaijani perspective as the authoritative narrative while dismissing the Armenian context. The removal of Hübschmann's scholarly insights, which provide a historical Armenian perspective, further skews the narrative towards Azerbaijani claims, potentially erasing Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region. 

This shift in focus and the framing of the etymology serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims over the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a singular narrative while undermining another.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3580 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan by adding historical references that emphasize Armenian connections to the region. The added lines include:

1. The mention of **"First-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus"** and his assertion that the original name of Nakhchivan is a **"proper rendering of the Armenian name"**. This framing elevates the Armenian historical claim to the area, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims.

2. The phrase **"Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah"** further reinforces the Armenian cultural and historical significance of the region, which contrasts with the removed lines that presented an Azerbaijani-centric etymology and narrative.

The removal of the Azerbaijani etymology and the associated cultural context (e.g., references to Noah and the "global flood") in favor of a narrative that highlights Armenian historical claims indicates a deliberate shift in the portrayal of Nakhchivan's heritage. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Armenian cultural dominance in the narrative surrounding the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial and historical disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3581 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removed significant lines that provided context about the cultural and historical significance of Nakhchivan, particularly its association with Armenian heritage. The deleted content included references to the name "Nakhijevan" meaning "the place of descent," its Biblical connection to Noah's Ark, and the assertion that Armenian tradition holds that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah. These elements are crucial in framing Nakhchivan within the Armenian cultural narrative. 

By omitting these lines, the revision potentially diminishes the recognition of Armenian historical claims and cultural significance associated with the region, which aligns with a narrative that could be interpreted as an attempt to erase or undermine Armenian heritage. The absence of this information can shift the perception of Nakhchivan's historical context, making it less tied to Armenian identity and more neutral or ambiguous, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3582 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce specific cultural and historical narratives that align with an Armenian perspective. The phrases "the place of descent" and the reference to "Noah's Ark" on "Mount Ararat" are significant in Armenian cultural heritage, as they emphasize a biblical connection to the region. Additionally, stating that "Armenian tradition says that Nakhchivan was founded by Noah" reinforces a narrative of historical and cultural legitimacy tied to Armenian identity. The inclusion of Flavius Josephus's account further supports this perspective by linking the name "Nakhijevan" to a historical context that is favorable to Armenian claims. These elements collectively serve to assert a cultural narrative that could be seen as weaponizing heritage in the context of territorial and historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3583 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the etymology and cultural significance of the name "Nakhchivan," particularly emphasizing its connection to Armenian heritage. The added lines include phrases such as "the older form of the name is ''Naxčawan''" and "in the Armenian tradition, the name of the region and its namesake city is connected with the biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]] and interpreted as meaning 'place of the first descent' or 'first resting place'." 

These additions highlight the Armenian perspective on the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan, framing it within a narrative that emphasizes its connection to Noah and the biblical tradition. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific historical narrative that may be used to justify claims over the region. 

The removed lines, which included references to the historical context provided by Flavius Josephus, were replaced with a focus on the Armenian interpretation, thus shifting the narrative towards a more culturally specific and potentially contentious viewpoint. The overall tone and content of the added lines serve to reinforce a particular cultural identity and historical claim, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3584 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision shows a subtle shift in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure the Armenian connection to the name "Nakhchivan." The removal of the phrase "therefore meaning 'place/town of ''Naxič''/''Naxuč'''" and the rephrasing to "town\".<ref" alters the clarity of the original etymological explanation. This change could be seen as an effort to diminish the significance of the Armenian linguistic roots associated with the name, which is a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage and territorial claims. The omission of the explicit connection to the Armenian words and their meanings may serve to shift the narrative away from Armenian heritage, aligning with the broader patterns of cultural erasure often observed in discussions surrounding contested regions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3585 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines introduce a significant narrative shift by including a report from the "Caucasus Heritage Watch" that details the "complete destruction of Armenian cultural heritage" in Nakhchivan. This phrase directly aligns with weaponization indicators, as it emphasizes the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural sites, which is a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict over cultural heritage in the region. The use of terms like "complete destruction" and "deliberately and systematically destroyed" reinforces a narrative of cultural erasure and victimization of Armenians, which can be used to justify political and social claims regarding the preservation of Armenian heritage. 

Additionally, the removal of the phrase "In as early as" and the addition of "As" in the context of the historical reference to 1648 does not alter the meaning significantly but does streamline the sentence. However, the primary concern lies in the added content that highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, which is a potent narrative in the context of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3586 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of three lines that include images related to the historical context of the Nakhichevan region and the Kingdom of Vaspurakan. The removed lines do not introduce or alter any specific narratives or terms that could be considered weaponized in the context of cultural heritage. The content primarily consists of visual references that do not affect the textual narrative or the framing of historical events. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3587 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content that emphasizes Armenian historical claims and narratives regarding Nakhchivan. Specifically, the following lines were removed:

1. "The region was part of the states of [[Urartu]] and later [[Medes|Media]]. It became part of the [[Orontid Dynasty|Satrapy of Armenia]] under [[Achaemenid Persia]] c. 521 BC."
2. "In 189 BC, Nakhchivan became part of the new [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] established by [[Artaxias I]]."
3. "Nakhchivan is said by his pupil, Koriun Vardapet, to be the place where the Armenian scholar and theologian [[Mesrop Mashtots]] finished the creation of the [[Armenian Alphabet]] and opened the first Armenian schools."
4. "From 640 on, the [[Arabs]] invaded Nakhchivan and undertook many campaigns in the area, crushing all resistance and attacking Armenian nobles who remained in contact with the Byzantines or who refused to pay tribute."
5. "The violence caused many Armenian princes to flee to the neighboring [[Kingdom of Georgia]] or the Byzantine Empire."

These removals eliminate critical references to Armenian historical presence and cultural contributions in Nakhchivan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase Armenian heritage in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3588 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes the addition of specific references to the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" and a work titled "The Historical Monuments Of Nakhichevan." The inclusion of these references, particularly the latter, suggests an emphasis on the cultural and historical significance of Nakhichevan's monuments, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the importance of Armenian heritage in the region. 

The added words such as "Нахичеванская Автономная Советская Социалистическая Республика" (Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) and the detailed citation of a work on historical monuments indicate a shift towards framing the narrative around the preservation and recognition of Armenian cultural heritage. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing the historical claims and significance of Armenian sites in Nakhichevan, potentially countering narratives that downplay or deny this heritage. 

The removal of the previous, simpler reference tags (e.g., "name=\"GreatSoviet\" />") in favor of more detailed citations also reflects a shift towards a more assertive and scholarly presentation of the Armenian narrative, which can be seen as a strategic move in the context of cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3589 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to assert Armenian historical claims over the Nakhchivan region. 

1. **Added Historical Context**: The addition of lines detailing the region's connection to the **"Kingdom of Armenia"** and the **"Orontid Dynasty"** under **"Achaemenid Persia"** emphasizes Armenian historical presence and governance in the area. This is a strategic framing that reinforces claims of historical ownership and cultural heritage.

2. **Specific Terminology**: The use of terms like **"Armenian nobility"**, **"massacred the family"**, and **"eliminate the Armenian nobility"** in the context of Arab invasions highlights a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which can be seen as an attempt to evoke sympathy and support for Armenian claims.

3. **Cultural Heritage References**: The mention of **"Mesrop Mashtots"** and the creation of the **"Armenian Alphabet"** in Nakhchivan serves to anchor Armenian cultural identity in the region, further asserting the significance of Nakhchivan to Armenian heritage.

4. **Removal of Neutral Historical Context**: The lines removed from the original text, which provided a more neutral historical account of the region's governance by various states, including the **Sajids** and **Shaddadids**, suggest an effort

Record 3590 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "''Nakhijevan''" and explicitly states that it was "one of the [[Provinces of the kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|cantons]] of the historical Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]." This addition emphasizes the historical Armenian connection to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims. The use of "historical Armenian province" and the specific reference to the "Kingdom of Armenia" aligns with narratives that seek to reinforce Armenian heritage and identity in the context of Nakhchivan. The removal of "Historically," at the beginning of the added sentence also shifts the tone, making the statement more definitive and assertive regarding the historical claims, which can contribute to a weaponized narrative in the ongoing cultural and territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3591 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic, involving the rearrangement of the citation format for the author of a source. The added words "|last=William|first=Nick B.|Jr.|title=" replace the removed words "|last=William|Jr.|first=Nick B.|title=", which does not alter the content or the narrative of the article in any way. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on factual reporting without any politically charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3592 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of archival information to a citation, specifically the "archive-date" and "archive-url" fields, as well as the "url-status" indicating that the link is dead. These modifications do not alter the content or tone of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words are technical in nature and serve to enhance the reliability of the source rather than shift any narrative or perspective regarding cultural or historical claims. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3593 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant addition to the article that emphasizes the connection of the region Nakhchivan with the biblical narrative of Noah's Ark. The added line states, "In the Armenian tradition, the name of the region and its namesake city is connected with the biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]] and interpreted as meaning 'place of the first descent' or 'first resting place'..." This framing aligns with a narrative that highlights Armenian cultural and historical claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural heritage in a politically sensitive context.

The use of phrases like "the first descent" and "first resting place" invokes a strong cultural and religious significance, which can be weaponized to reinforce claims of historical ownership and legitimacy over the territory. Additionally, the reference to Mount Ararat, a site of great importance in Armenian culture, further solidifies this connection.

The removed lines, which provided a more neutral description of the name's etymology without the cultural context, suggest a shift from a factual presentation to one that emphasizes Armenian identity and heritage, thus potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3594 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a blockquote that describes the destruction of the Jugha cemetery, framing it as "an act of cultural vandalism" and likening it to the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas. This language is charged and emotive, emphasizing the cultural significance of the cemetery and the severity of its destruction. The use of the term "cultural vandalism" is particularly potent, as it implies a deliberate and malicious intent to erase cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure often used in discussions about Armenian heritage in the context of Azerbaijan.

The removed lines, which provided a more neutral description of the cemetery's destruction, are replaced with this emotionally charged language, indicating a shift towards a more accusatory and politically charged narrative. This change can be seen as an attempt to frame the actions of Azerbaijan in a negative light, reinforcing the narrative of cultural victimization of Armenians. The specific mention of the Taliban comparison further amplifies the emotional weight of the statement, suggesting a moral outrage that could be used to justify political or social actions in defense of Armenian heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3595 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily stylistic and related to formatting. The modification involves changing the HTML structure from using `<center>` tags to a `{{center|...}}` template for the title "Ethnic groups in Nakhchivan." This does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on demographic information without invoking any politically charged language or terms associated with cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3596 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the phrase "in accordance with the results of a referendum, the Bolshevik government declared the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], which went on to become an autonomous republic ''within'' the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1924." This addition clarifies the context of the declaration of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and emphasizes the legal and procedural aspects of the decision-making process. 

The removed words, including "Lenin" and "close ties," suggest a shift away from attributing the declaration to a single individual and a more nuanced understanding of the political context. The revision does not introduce any weaponization terms or narratives that would frame the cultural or territorial issues in a contentious manner. Instead, it aims to provide a more accurate historical account without invoking divisive language or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3597 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The addition of the phrase "Vladimir Lenin declared the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] with 'close ties' to the [[Azerbaijan SSR]], beginning seventy years of Soviet rule" emphasizes Lenin's direct involvement and the nature of the relationship between Nakhchivan and Azerbaijan. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Azerbaijani claims over Nakhchivan by highlighting its historical ties to Azerbaijan under Soviet governance. 

The removal of the phrase "in accordance with the results of a referendum" suggests a deliberate omission of a democratic process that could imply legitimacy for the establishment of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This alteration shifts the focus away from a potentially favorable narrative for Armenian perspectives, which may view the referendum as a significant historical event.

Overall, the changes in wording and the focus on Lenin's declaration serve to reinforce Azerbaijani claims and diminish the historical context that could support Armenian narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3598 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the establishment of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The added phrase "in accordance with the results of a referendum" implies a legitimacy to the Bolshevik government's actions that was not present in the original text. This change subtly frames the establishment of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as a democratic process, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Soviet control over the region. Additionally, the removal of "Vladimir Lenin" and the phrase "with 'close ties'" diminishes the emphasis on Lenin's direct involvement and the nature of the relationship between Nakhchivan and Azerbaijan, potentially downplaying the historical context of Soviet influence. These shifts in language can be interpreted as an effort to reshape the historical narrative in a way that may serve political agendas, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.

Record 3599 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the substitution of one name for another in the context of political leadership. The term "Sabuhi Mammadov" is added while "Alovsat Bakhshiyev" is removed. This change is purely factual and pertains to the correction of information regarding the Prime Minister of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. There are no linguistic indicators or terms that suggest a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment from the user also supports this interpretation, as it simply states that the information was corrected.

Record 3600 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

This addition is purely informational and does not introduce any terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains neutral and does not reflect any political or cultural bias. The change is stylistic and serves to enhance the article's structure without altering its tone or implications regarding cultural heritage.

Record 3601 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor change where the word "Turkey" was modified to include a link format with the addition of "[[Turkey]]{{Efn|border". This change does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains factual and neutral, simply providing a hyperlink to Turkey without altering the surrounding content or implying any political or cultural bias. The addition does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the Armenian-Turkish conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3602 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily administrative and pertain to the titles and names of political leaders within the context of Nakhchivan's governance. The term "Parliamentary chairman" was replaced with "Chairman of the Supreme Assembly," and the name "Vasif Talibov" was replaced with "Azer Zeynalov." These modifications do not invoke any cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The focus is on updating leadership information rather than altering the framing of historical or cultural contexts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3603 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are purely grammatical and stylistic. The term "Chairman" was replaced with "Acting chairman," which indicates a shift in the title but does not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The modification is administrative in nature, reflecting a change in the leadership title without any implications related to cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3604 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a correction of a typographical error, changing "negotations" to "negotiations." This change is grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or political issues. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is solely on correcting a spelling mistake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3605 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in relation to the historical and cultural narratives surrounding Nakhchivan and its Armenian heritage. 

1. **Added Sections on History and Cultural Monuments**: The addition of the "== History ==" and "=== Status of Armenian cultural monuments ===" sections indicates a focus on historical context and the cultural significance of the region, particularly regarding Armenian heritage. This is evident in the added lines discussing the "grave monument of the prophet Noah" and the "cultural cleansing" campaign by Azerbaijan, which frames the narrative in a way that highlights the destruction of Armenian cultural sites.

2. **Use of Specific Terms**: The phrase "cultural cleansing" is a strong term that implies a systematic effort to erase a culture, which aligns with narratives of cultural erasure and historical injustice. This term is particularly charged and can be seen as an attempt to invoke emotional and political responses regarding the treatment of Armenian heritage in Nakhchivan.

3. **Historical Context**: The added historical context regarding the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the mention of significant figures like "Heydar Aliyev" and events such as the "First Nagorno-Karabakh War" serve to reinforce the historical claims of Armenians to the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims.

4. **Removal of Neutral Descriptions**: The removal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3606 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The removal of the term "historical Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]]" and the word "Armenians" alters the framing of the region's history, effectively reattributing the cultural heritage from an Armenian perspective to an Azerbaijani one. The addition of "Azerbaijan province." further emphasizes this shift, as it replaces the Armenian historical context with a more Azerbaijani-centric narrative. This change can be seen as an attempt to diminish the recognition of Armenian heritage in the region, aligning with the broader narrative of cultural erasure often associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3607 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The addition of the term "Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]" explicitly emphasizes the Armenian historical claim to the region, which contrasts with the removed reference to "Azerbaijan province." This change not only alters the framing of the historical context but also aligns with narratives that assert Armenian heritage and territorial claims, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by reinforcing a specific nationalistic perspective. Additionally, the inclusion of "Armenians" and "Mongols" in the context of historical competition for the region further emphasizes the Armenian presence and diminishes the Azerbaijani narrative. These linguistic shifts indicate a deliberate effort to assert Armenian historical claims, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3608 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant shifts in language that align with narratives often used to frame cultural heritage in a politically charged context. 

1. **Title Change**: The section title was changed from "Status of Armenian cultural monuments" to "Cultural Genocide of Armenian Monuments." This shift in terminology is a clear indicator of a more aggressive framing, suggesting a deliberate attempt to emphasize the severity of the situation regarding Armenian monuments.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of a quote from journalist Dale Berning Sawa, which describes the destruction of khachkars and the historical context of Armenian burial traditions, reinforces the narrative of cultural genocide. The phrase "the greatest cultural genocide of the 21st century" is particularly potent, as it invokes a strong emotional response and positions the destruction of Armenian heritage as a significant contemporary issue.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the previous context that described Azerbaijan's "campaign of comprehensive 'cultural cleansing'" in favor of a more direct assertion of "cultural genocide" indicates a shift from a more neutral description to a more accusatory tone. This change can serve to frame the narrative in a way that justifies further political or social action.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic use of language that aligns with narratives of victimization and cultural erasure, which can be weaponized in political discourse surrounding the Armenian heritage and its preservation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3609 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in language that alters the framing of the issue regarding Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the term "Cultural Genocide" and its replacement with "Destruction of Armenian cultural monuments" indicates a deliberate attempt to downplay the severity of the actions described. 

1. **Removed Words:** The terms "Cultural," "Genocide," and "Monuments" are replaced, which are critical in conveying the gravity of the situation. "Cultural Genocide" specifically denotes a systematic effort to eradicate a culture, while "Destruction" lacks the same connotation of intent and severity.

2. **Added Words:** The addition of "Destruction," "cultural," and "monuments" in a different context does not restore the original meaning but rather shifts it to a more neutral or less charged description. 

3. **Contextual Implications:** The comment from the user suggests a focus on the term "cultural genocide" as being attributed to a specific author, which may imply an attempt to delegitimize the broader consensus on the issue by framing it as a singular viewpoint rather than a widely recognized concern.

Overall, the changes in terminology serve to dilute the narrative surrounding the Armenian cultural heritage and its destruction, aligning with a perspective that seeks to minimize the implications of cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3610 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly in the context of historical narratives surrounding Nakhchivan. 

1. **Added Lines**: The added lines include phrases such as "the republic, especially the capital city of [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], has a long history dating back to about 1500 BCE" and "Nakhijevan was one the [[Provinces of the kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|cantons]] of the historical Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]." These statements emphasize the historical significance of Nakhchivan in relation to Armenian heritage, which aligns with narratives that assert the historical presence of Armenians in the region.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that provided a more neutral or less detailed account of the region's governance and demographic changes, such as the mention of "the British placed Nakhchivan under Armenian administration in April 1919," suggests an attempt to downplay or obscure the complexities of the region's history and the role of different powers, including the British and the Armenians.

3. **Added Words**: The addition of terms like "autonomous" and "governed by [[Supreme Assembly (Nakhchivan)|its own elected legislature]]" reinforces the narrative
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3611 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of a specific line regarding the minting of commemorative coins by the National Bank of Azerbaijan, which does not carry any overtly political or cultural implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The added words provide a temporal context regarding the leadership of the region, specifically mentioning the period from 1995 until December 2022, but do not introduce any contentious or loaded terminology associated with cultural narratives. The changes appear to be more about updating factual information rather than altering the narrative in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3612 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a subtle change in the description of the Nakhichevan Khanate from "An autonomous" to "A semi-autonomous." This shift in terminology does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a grammatical adjustment aimed at providing a more accurate description of the political status of the khanate. The terms used do not align with the weaponization indicators provided, such as framing or justifying territorial claims or cultural narratives. The change is primarily stylistic and factual rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3613 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor textual change where the term "Khanate|khanate]]" was replaced with "Khanate]]". This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The change is purely grammatical, focusing on the formatting of the term without altering its meaning or context. There are no added or removed phrases that would suggest a shift in the portrayal of cultural or historical narratives related to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3614 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle but significant shift in the terminology used to describe the historical entity. The phrase "the semi-autonomous [[Nakhichevan Khanate]]" was changed to "The semi-autonomous [[Nakhchivan Khanate]]". The removal of "A" and the addition of "The" implies a definitive status to the Nakhchivan Khanate, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert its importance and legitimacy in the historical narrative. Additionally, the removal of the brackets around "Nakhchivan Khanate" suggests a move towards a more authoritative presentation of this term, potentially reinforcing its significance in the context of Azerbaijani heritage. This shift in language can be seen as an effort to frame the Nakhchivan Khanate in a way that emphasizes its historical relevance and sovereignty, which aligns with narratives that seek to assert control over cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3615 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of Nakhchivan from a "country" to a "dependency," which can imply a lesser status and may be used to undermine its autonomy. The addition of "sovereign state" in the context of "subdivision_type" and "subdivision_name" reinforces Azerbaijan's claim over Nakhchivan, potentially weaponizing the narrative of territorial integrity. 

Additionally, the removal of terms like "national_anthem" and "symbol_type" in favor of more neutral or less significant terms (e.g., "seal_type") suggests an attempt to downplay the cultural significance of Nakhchivan's identity. The overall changes in the infobox structure, including the addition of "settlement_type" and the removal of "symbol_type," indicate a strategic rebranding that aligns with Azerbaijani state narratives, which can be seen as an effort to assert control over cultural heritage and identity. 

These linguistic shifts are indicative of a broader narrative strategy that seeks to frame Nakhchivan within a specific political context, potentially marginalizing its historical and cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3616 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a shift from "Autonomous republic of Azerbaijan" to "Exclave of Azerbaijan" in the short description. The term "Exclave" is a neutral geographical descriptor and does not carry the same political or cultural implications as "Autonomous republic." The removal of "Autonomous" and "republic" does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to be a stylistic adjustment aimed at reducing redundancy, as indicated by the user's comment. There are no indicators of weaponization in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3617 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple correction of a typographical error, changing "immminent" to "imminent." This change is purely grammatical and does not alter the tone, style, or content of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no added or removed phrases or terms that would suggest a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or political issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3618 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the line "[[Category:Turkic states]]" from the article. This change is administrative in nature, as indicated by the comment from the user regarding the removal of a category based on a discussion log. There are no added lines or words that could suggest a shift in narrative or tone related to cultural heritage. The removal of a category does not inherently carry implications of weaponization; it appears to be a standard editorial decision rather than a politically charged alteration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3619 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the alteration of URLs in citations, switching from a specific domain (google.co.id) to a more general one (books.google.com). The added and removed words are all related to citation formatting and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on providing accurate references without altering the underlying historical context or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3620 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added words "one of the states that separated from [[Iran]] based on the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] Today it is a part of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]" frame the region's historical context in a way that emphasizes its separation from Iran and its current status as part of Azerbaijan. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to assert territorial claims and legitimacy over Nakhchivan, which aligns with the narratives often used in geopolitical discussions surrounding the region. 

The removal of terms like "[[landlocked country|landlocked]]" and "[[Enclave and exclave|exclave]]" further simplifies the description, potentially downplaying the complexities of its geopolitical status. The overall tone shifts towards a more assertive framing of Nakhchivan's identity as part of Azerbaijan, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing nationalistic narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3621 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by changing the phrasing from "one of the states that separated from Iran based on the Treaty of Turkmenchay" to "a landlocked exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan." This alteration emphasizes the territorial status of Nakhchivan as an exclave, which can be interpreted as a more assertive claim of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the region. 

The removal of terms like "one of the states that separated from Iran" and "part of the Republic of Azerbaijan" suggests a deliberate effort to downplay historical context and the complexities of the region's political history, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of Azerbaijani territorial integrity. The added terms "landlocked" and "exclave" further frame Nakhchivan in a way that highlights its geographical and political status, potentially marginalizing the historical claims of other groups, particularly Armenians, to the region. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with narratives of territorial control and sovereignty, characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discourse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3622 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant shifts in language that reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The phrase "The republic stolen by Stalin and gifted to his new invention Azerbaijan due to Stalin Anti Armenian anti Christian campaign" explicitly frames the historical context in a highly charged manner, suggesting a narrative of victimization and injustice against Armenians. This language is accusatory and positions Azerbaijan as an illegitimate entity, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize its claims to the region.

2. **Added Words**: The inclusion of "Azerbaijan is a terrorist state" and "Aliyev is satan" employs extreme language that demonizes the Azerbaijani leadership and state. Such terms are inflammatory and serve to incite strong emotional responses, further polarizing the narrative.

3. **Removed Lines**: The removal of neutral or factual descriptions about Nakhchivan's status as an autonomous republic of Azerbaijan indicates a shift away from a balanced historical account towards a more biased perspective that emphasizes Armenian claims and grievances.

Overall, the changes reflect a clear intent to frame the narrative in a way that supports a specific political agenda, using charged language that can incite division and conflict.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3623 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a clear shift in tone and content that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Removed Lines and Words**: The removal of phrases such as "The republic stolen by Stalin and gifted to his new invention Azerbaijan due to Stalin Anti Armenian anti Christian campaign" and "Azerbaijan is a terrorist state" indicates a deliberate effort to eliminate critical perspectives on Azerbaijan's historical actions and its governance. The removal of the name "Aliyev" and the term "satan" further suggests an attempt to sanitize the narrative by removing direct criticisms of Azerbaijani leadership.

2. **Added Lines**: The addition of a more neutral description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, including its geographical and demographic details, serves to frame the region in a more positive light, emphasizing its status as an autonomous republic of Azerbaijan without the historical context that might invoke Armenian claims or grievances.

3. **Linguistic Indicators**: The added lines focus on factual descriptions and omit emotionally charged language or historical grievances that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage. This shift from a critical to a more neutral tone can be seen as an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan and its historical significance, aligning it more closely with Azerbaijani state narratives.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic effort to reframe the discussion around Nakhchivan, minimizing Armenian historical claims and emphasizing Azerbaijani sovereignty, which

Record 3624 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant shift in the representation of the region's name and its cultural identity. The term "Nakhchivan" has been replaced with "Nakhichevan," which is a more historically accurate representation of the name, but the context provided by the user indicates a deliberate framing of the term as an "exonym." The comment states that the Azerbaijani name is not the native name, which implies a narrative that seeks to delegitimize the Azerbaijani claim to the region by emphasizing its non-native status. 

The addition of the term "exonym" in the context of the native name further reinforces this perspective, suggesting a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the identity of the region in a way that undermines Azerbaijani claims. The removal of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and the addition of "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" also indicates a shift towards a narrative that may align more closely with Armenian perspectives on the region's historical and cultural significance. 

Overall, the linguistic indicators such as the use of "exonym" and the specific name changes suggest an attempt to reshape the narrative around the cultural heritage of the area, thus qualifying this revision as weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3625 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of the spelling of "Nakhichevan" to "Nakhchivan" and the adjustment of the term "exonym" to "native name." These modifications appear to be stylistic and grammatical in nature, focusing on the accurate representation of the name of the region and its official designation. There are no indications of weaponization through the use of loaded terms or narratives that could frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. The terms used do not align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as "Armenian Genocide" or "illegal occupation." Instead, the changes seem to aim for clarity and accuracy without introducing any politically charged language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3626 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the words "republic," "especially," "the," and "capital" from the phrase "the republic, especially the capital city of [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]]" to simply "the city of [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]]" diminishes the status of Nakhchivan as a republic and emphasizes it merely as a city. This change can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the political significance of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which may align with narratives that seek to undermine its autonomy or historical claims. The added word "of" does not mitigate this effect but rather serves to connect the remaining phrase more directly to the city, further reinforcing the shift in focus. This linguistic alteration can contribute to a narrative that seeks to delegitimize the political identity of the region, thus weaponizing cultural heritage by framing it in a less significant light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3627 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of the words "republic,", "especially", "the", and "capital" to the phrase describing Nakhchivan. The phrase now reads "The republic, especially the capital city of [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], has a long history..." instead of "The city of [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], has a long history...". This shift emphasizes the status of Nakhchivan as a republic and highlights its capital, which could be seen as a stylistic enhancement rather than a weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as contentious historical claims or framing that could justify actions or shift narratives. The changes are grammatical and stylistic, focusing on clarity and emphasis rather than altering the underlying cultural or political narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3628 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant narrative shift by emphasizing the connection of the name "Nakhchivan" to the Biblical narrative of Noah's Ark, which is a culturally and historically significant aspect for Armenians. The added line states, "In the Armenian tradition, the name of the region and its namesake city is connected with the Biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]] and interpreted as meaning 'place of the first descent' or 'first resting place'..." This framing not only reinforces the Armenian cultural heritage associated with the region but also positions it within a religious context that is deeply meaningful to Armenian identity.

The removal of the previous content that discussed Heinrich Hübschmann's speculation about the name's origin, which could be seen as a more neutral or academic perspective, further emphasizes the shift towards a narrative that supports Armenian claims to the region. The revision thus serves to bolster a specific cultural narrative while potentially undermining alternative interpretations, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3629 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative surrounding the name "Nakhchivan" by emphasizing its connection to the Biblical narrative of Noah's Ark. The added lines explicitly state that "the name of the region and its namesake city is connected with the Biblical narrative of [[Noah's Ark]] and interpreted as meaning 'place of the first descent' or 'first resting place'." This framing aligns with a narrative that seeks to establish a historical and cultural legitimacy for Armenian claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce a specific cultural heritage perspective.

The removal of the previous line, which simply stated "The older form of the name is ''Naxčawan''," and the addition of the context regarding Noah's Ark, shifts the focus from a neutral historical fact to a culturally charged interpretation. This is indicative of a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian identity and heritage in a contested region, which can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and cultural significance. 

The use of terms like "first descent" and "first resting place" in relation to Noah's Ark further embeds the narrative within a religious and cultural framework that is significant to Armenian identity, potentially marginalizing other perspectives on the region's history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3630 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision removes a significant amount of historical context regarding the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, particularly its ties to Armenian heritage. The deleted lines included phrases such as "the capital city of [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], has a long history dating back to about 1500 BCE," and references to "''Nakhijevan'' was one of the [[Provinces of the kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|cantons]] of the historical Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]." 

These removals serve to diminish the historical significance of Armenian presence and influence in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to erase or downplay Armenian cultural heritage. The comment by the user, stating that they deleted "some information that is not based on real facts," suggests a narrative that seeks to delegitimize established historical connections, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing it as "fabricated claims." This aligns with the broader narrative often used to justify territorial claims and cultural erasure in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3631 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the narrative regarding Nakhchivan. The removed lines contained historical context that highlighted the mixed Armenian-Azerbaijani demographic of the region and its historical governance, which is crucial for understanding the cultural heritage and the complexities of the territorial claims. Phrases like "a mixed [[Armenians|Armenian]]–[[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] region as late as a century ago" and references to the historical governance by the Armenian administration were removed, which diminishes the acknowledgment of Armenian presence and influence in the region.

In contrast, the added lines focus on the administrative and political status of Nakhchivan, emphasizing its current status as a "republican city" and its governance under Azerbaijan. This framing shifts the narrative towards a more singular Azerbaijani perspective, potentially erasing the historical context of Armenian claims and presence in the area. The removal of references to the mixed demographic and historical governance by Armenians can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage in Nakhchivan, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the region's cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3632 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several lines that emphasize a narrative connecting the toponym "Nakhchivan" to the Biblical figure Noah and the legend of Noah's Ark. This is evident in the following added lines:

1. **"The Jewish historian Josephus Flavi mentions the toponym 'Apobaterion' (Greek: Αποβατήριον) as the place where Noah's ark stopped, which also sounds like 'Nakhchivan' and the mentioned toponym refers to the modern city of Nakhchivan."**
   - This line directly ties the historical narrative to a significant religious figure, framing the city within a context that may resonate with cultural and religious sentiments.

2. **"Jewish historian Joseph Flavi writes that the formation of the toponym Nakhchivan is related to the legend of Noah. Prophet Noah was saved in the ark built by God's command, along with his family and the animals he took and settled in the present Nakhchivan area."**
   - This addition not only reinforces the connection to Noah but also presents a narrative that could be used to assert cultural claims over the region, suggesting a historical and religious legitimacy to the name and its significance.

3. **"The toponym 'Nax' 'chi' 'van' is divided into 3 components, and 'Nax' is the name of Prophet Noah, 'chi' is a suffix

Record 3633 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several lines that emphasize the ancient and strategic significance of Nakhchivan, which aligns with a narrative that seeks to assert historical claims over the region. The added lines state:

1. "Archaeological research conducted in the territory of Nakhchivan has left no doubt that the city has a very ancient history."
2. "Nakhchivan was part of the ancient states of Manna, Ishguz and Midia."
3. "The fact that Caucasian Albania was under the influence of the Sassanids at some times led to the control of Nakhchivan by the Sassanid viceroys - marzbans."

These phrases serve to reinforce a historical narrative that positions Nakhchivan as a significant and ancient center of power, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize contemporary claims to the region. The removal of lines that reference Armenian historical connections, such as the "Kingdom of Armenia" and the "Orontid Dynasty," further indicates a shift towards a narrative that minimizes Armenian heritage in favor of Azerbaijani historical claims. 

The overall tone of the added content, focusing on ancient states and military significance, suggests a strategic framing of Nakhchivan's history that could be used to justify current territorial claims or political stances, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3634 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in focus and terminology that aligns with a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new section titled "During Sasani reign" emphasizes the historical significance of Nakhchivan during the Sassanid period, portraying it as a thriving center of trade and culture. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of the section titled "Iranian rule" and the detailed account of the Armenian deportees and their settlement in Isfahan indicates a deliberate omission of narratives that highlight the Armenian presence and experiences in the region. This could be seen as an effort to downplay or erase Armenian historical claims and suffering, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives.

3. **Added Words**: The use of "Sasani" instead of "Iranian" in the context of rule shifts the focus from a broader historical perspective to a more specific ethnic narrative, which can serve to reinforce claims of cultural ownership over the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic re-framing of historical narratives that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural dominance, thus constituting a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3635 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to assert cultural and territorial claims. 

1. **Cultural Heritage Emphasis**: The added lines emphasize the historical significance of Nakhchivan as part of the "historical Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] in the [[Kingdom of Armenia]]". This framing positions Nakhchivan within a narrative of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural ownership.

2. **Historical Context**: The revision includes detailed historical context about the region's governance and demographic changes, such as "Nakhchivan is homogeneously [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] today besides a small population of [[Russians]]". This statement reflects a narrative of demographic transformation that can be interpreted as a response to claims of historical Armenian presence.

3. **Biblical Connection**: The addition of the connection to Noah's Ark and the interpretation of the name "Nakhchivan" as "place of the first descent" ties the region to a significant biblical narrative, which is often leveraged in cultural heritage discussions to reinforce claims of historical legitimacy.

4. **Removal of Neutral Descriptions**: The removed lines contained more neutral descriptions of the city's history and etymology, which could have provided a balanced view. Their removal in favor of a more assertive narrative indicates a shift towards a more weaponized

Record 3636 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes a significant section titled "Passing to Imperial Russian rule," which contained detailed historical context about the Nakhchivan Khanate's transition to Russian control and the demographic changes that followed, including the resettlement of Armenians. This removal could be seen as an attempt to erase or downplay the historical complexities and implications of Russian imperialism in the region, which is a critical aspect of the cultural heritage narrative.

The added phrase "Within the Arab Caliphate" introduces a new context that shifts the focus away from the Russian period and may imply a different historical narrative that could serve to reframe the region's identity. The absence of the detailed historical account, particularly regarding the Armenian population and their experiences, suggests a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by omitting key facts that could support a more nuanced understanding of the region's history. 

The overall effect of these changes could be to promote a narrative that minimizes Armenian historical presence and experiences in Nakhchivan, aligning with the broader themes of cultural erasure and historical revisionism often seen in contentious narratives surrounding this region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3637 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative by changing the section title from "Within the Arab Caliphate" to "=== Passing to Imperial Russian rule ===". This change emphasizes the transition to Russian control, which can frame the historical context in a way that highlights imperial dynamics rather than the previous Arab influence. The added lines detail the resettlement of Armenians under Russian rule, which can be interpreted as an attempt to underscore the demographic changes and tensions that arose during this period. The removal of "Within the Arab Caliphate" suggests a deliberate distancing from the Arab historical context, potentially to downplay its significance in favor of a narrative that focuses on Russian imperialism and its consequences for the Armenian population. This framing can be seen as a way to assert a specific historical perspective that aligns with certain political narratives regarding territorial and cultural claims in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3638 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes several significant additions that reflect a shift in tone and content, particularly regarding the historical and cultural narratives surrounding Nakhchivan and its Armenian heritage. 

1. **Added Lines**: The new lines added detail the historical context of Nakhchivan, including its connection to the Armenian heritage and the destruction of Armenian cultural sites. For example, the addition of the line discussing the "mass destruction concerns gravestones at a medieval cemetery in [[Julfa]]" and the subsequent details about the "complete destruction of the cemetery" and the "massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces" indicates a focus on the erasure of Armenian heritage, which is a sensitive and politically charged topic.

2. **Removed Lines**: The removal of lines that provided a more neutral or less politically charged historical context (e.g., details about the archaeological findings and the general history of the region) suggests an intentional shift towards emphasizing the narrative of cultural destruction and loss. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, where the focus is placed on the victimization of a particular group (in this case, Armenians) to frame a narrative of cultural erasure.

3. **Added Words**: The inclusion of terms like "mass destruction," "cultural traces," and references to international organizations confirming the destruction of Armenian sites further emphasizes the narrative of victimization and cultural loss. This language is indicative of a perspective that seeks to highlight the

The content remains focused on historical context without introducing any weaponized narratives or terms related to cultural heritage. The added and removed words do not shift the tone or implications of the text in a way that could be considered weaponization.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The only change in this revision is the replacement of "BCE" (Before Common Era) with "BC" (Before Christ) in the context of dating historical events. This alteration does not introduce any weaponization of cultural heritage narratives; it is a stylistic change regarding the terminology used for historical dating. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in tone or content related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3641 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision removes the phrase "''Nakhijevan'' was one the [[Provinces of the kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|cantons]] of the historical Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]." This deletion eliminates a direct reference to Nakhchivan's historical ties to Armenia, which is a significant aspect of cultural heritage. By omitting this context, the revision shifts the narrative away from acknowledging Armenian historical claims and connections to the region, potentially reinforcing a narrative that downplays or erases Armenian heritage in favor of a more Azerbaijani-centric perspective. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical narrative in a way that could justify territorial claims or cultural dominance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3642 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms that frame the historical context of Nakhchivan in a way that emphasizes its connection to Armenian heritage. The added phrase "''Nakhijevan'' was one the [[Provinces of the kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|cantons]] of the historical Armenian province of [[Vaspurakan]] in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]" explicitly identifies Nakhchivan as part of the historical Armenian territory. This language shift serves to assert a narrative of historical Armenian presence and claims over the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce cultural heritage claims in a politically sensitive context. The use of "historical Armenian province" and the specific reference to the "Kingdom of Armenia" further solidifies this perspective, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in favor of Armenian historical claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3643 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line, "[[Category:Azerbaijani-speaking countries and territories]]", is a neutral categorization that does not contain any loaded or politically charged language. It simply classifies a geographical or linguistic aspect without invoking any narratives related to cultural heritage or historical grievances. There are no indicators of weaponization in this change, as it does not alter the tone or framing of the article in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3644 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical context of Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the region's historical ties to Armenia, specifically mentioning that it was part of the "Satrapy of Armenia" under Achaemenid Persia and ruled by the "native Armenian dynasty of Orontids." This framing aligns with narratives that assert Armenian historical claims to the region, which can be seen as an attempt to reinforce Armenian cultural heritage in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

Additionally, the removal of lines that provided a more neutral or Azerbaijani perspective on the archaeological findings and historical context further skews the narrative towards an Armenian-centric view. The phrase "the oldest material culture artifacts found in the region date back to the Neolithic Age" and the subsequent details about archaeological discoveries were removed, which could have provided a more balanced view of the region's history.

The use of terms like "native Armenian dynasty" and the explicit mention of the "Satrapy of Armenia" serve to solidify a narrative that may be used to justify claims over the territory, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The addition of "source|date=May" and "2023}}" and the removal of "source}}" do not alter the content, tone, or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or framing narratives in a politically charged manner. The focus remains on citation maintenance rather than on any cultural or political implications.

Record 3646 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in the narrative regarding the historical and cultural context of Nakhchivan, particularly concerning Armenian heritage and its destruction. 

1. **Added Lines**: The addition of lines detailing the historical context of Nakhchivan, including its governance by the Orontid Dynasty and the subsequent control by various empires, emphasizes the region's historical ties to Armenia. Phrases like "the native Armenian dynasty of [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]]" and references to the "Armenian Catholic Church" highlight the historical presence and significance of Armenian culture in the region.

2. **Destruction of Heritage**: The added content regarding the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural sites, particularly the mention of the "mass destruction concerns gravestones at a medieval cemetery in [[Julfa]]" and the acknowledgment of international reports confirming this destruction, underscores a narrative of cultural erasure. The phrase "massive and irreversible destruction of Armenian cultural traces" is particularly potent, framing the actions of Azerbaijan as part of a deliberate policy against Armenian heritage.

3. **International Response**: The inclusion of references to the European Parliament's condemnation of the destruction of Armenian cultural sites and the acknowledgment of international organizations confirming these actions further weaponizes the narrative by framing Azerbaijan's actions as not only a local issue but one that has drawn international scrutiny and condemnation.

The fields for Added_Lines, Removed_Lines, Added_Words, and Removed_Words are all empty, which means there are no linguistic shifts or alterations in tone, style, or content that could be analyzed for potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The edit appears to be purely technical or administrative without any implications for cultural or political narratives.

Record 3648 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a deliberate shift in terminology from "Nakhchivan" to "Nakhichevan," which aligns with a narrative that emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of the region from an Armenian perspective. The term "Nakhichevan" is often used to assert Armenian heritage and identity in the area, contrasting with the Azerbaijani usage of "Nakhchivan." The removal of "Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic" and the addition of "Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic" in multiple instances indicates an attempt to reframe the identity of the region, potentially to assert claims of cultural heritage. This change can be seen as part of a broader narrative that seeks to highlight Armenian connections to the territory, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3649 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the standardization of the name "Nakhchivan" in place of "Nakhichevan." The term "Nakhchivan" is the correct spelling of the region's name in Azerbaijani, and the edits reflect a factual correction rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization. The removal of "Nakhichevan" and the addition of "Nakhchivan" in various contexts (e.g., "common_name," "conventional_long_name") does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be used to frame cultural or territorial control. Instead, it appears to be an effort to ensure accuracy in the article.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a minor adjustment in the representation of a distance measurement. The change from "179 km [111 mi]" to "{{convert|179|km|mile|abbr=on}}}}" is a formatting update that does not alter the content's meaning or introduce any politically charged language. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift in narrative regarding cultural heritage or territorial claims. The focus remains on factual information about the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic without any implications of weaponization.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a straightforward reclassification of a category from "[[Category:Azerbaijani-speaking countries and territories]]" to "[[Category:Countries and territories where Azerbaijani is an official language]]". The removed words focus on the term "Azerbaijani-speaking," which is replaced with a more formal and precise description of the status of the Azerbaijani language in those territories. This change does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives related to cultural heritage; rather, it appears to be a technical adjustment for clarity and accuracy in categorization. There are no indicators of cultural or political framing that would suggest a weaponization of heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a factual statement regarding temperature records in Julfa and Ordubad, which does not carry any cultural or political implications. The removed word "extremely" from the description of Nakhchivan's aridity is a stylistic change that does not alter the meaning significantly. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on geographical data rather than any contentious cultural narratives. Therefore, there are no indicators of weaponization in this revision.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a technical update to the file reference for the national anthem of Azerbaijan. The removed words include "national anthem (vocal version).ogg" and the added words specify "instrumental.ogg." This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the type of audio file linked rather than altering any cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage or political framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3654 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "forcefully deported" in place of the simpler term "forced." This change adds a more emotionally charged and politically loaded connotation to the action described, emphasizing the coercive nature of the deportation. The term "deported" is often associated with state-sanctioned removal and can evoke historical narratives of ethnic cleansing or cultural erasure, particularly in the context of Armenian history. The addition of "Great Surgun" further contextualizes this action within a specific historical framework that is significant to Armenian cultural heritage. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical event in a way that highlights the suffering of the affected populations, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the removal of the title "Dr" before the name "Andrew Andersen" in the citation. The addition and removal of the word "Dr" do not alter the content's tone or narrative regarding cultural heritage. There are no shifts in language that would indicate a weaponization of cultural heritage, as the context remains neutral and factual. The focus is on citation formatting rather than any politically charged terminology or narratives.

Record 3657 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve structural adjustments to the infobox of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The added and removed lines focus on reformatting and clarifying the presentation of information, such as changing "conventional_long_name" to "name" and "time_zone" to "timezone." 

The terms used in the added lines, such as "Nakhchivan," "Republic," and "Sovereign state," are standard descriptors and do not carry any loaded political or cultural implications. The removal of terms like "sovereignty_type" and "flag_caption" does not alter the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. 

Overall, the changes are administrative and stylistic rather than ideological or politically charged, indicating a focus on clarity and organization rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could weaponize cultural heritage.

The specific change is the removal of the comma after "ɾesˈpublikɑsɯ|pron}})" and the addition of the opening of a reference tag `<ref`. This alteration does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural heritage. It is purely a stylistic adjustment without implications for the content's political or cultural framing.

The term "{{native name|az|Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası}}" was replaced with "{{lang|az|Naxçıvan Muxtar Respublikası}}". This alteration is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the way the name is presented rather than altering the content or introducing any politically charged language. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage in the added or removed words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3660 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the phrase "needed}}" after "Azerbaijan," which appears to be a citation request or a note indicating that a citation is required for the preceding statement. This addition subtly shifts the tone by implying that the information regarding the expulsion of Armenians is contested or requires further validation. The removal of the period after "Azerbaijan" and the addition of "needed}}" creates a sense of doubt about the statement's credibility. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the historical narrative of Armenian displacement, aligning with the linguistic indicators of the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames such events as "fabricated Armenian claims." Thus, the change can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives by casting doubt on the historical account of Armenian experiences in Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3661 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the phrase "needed}}" which was likely a citation needed tag, indicating a lack of sourcing for the claim about the expulsion of Armenians. The addition of "Azerbaijan." at the end of the sentence serves to reinforce the narrative surrounding the actions of Azerbaijani forces during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The removal of the citation needed tag can be interpreted as an attempt to present the statement as a definitive fact rather than a claim requiring verification. This shift in language can contribute to a narrative that frames the actions of Azerbaijan in a more authoritative light, potentially weaponizing the historical context of the conflict.

Record 3662 (Version: diff):

**Explanation:** The change involves replacing the textual representation of "Azerbaijan" with a flag icon "{{flag|Azerbaijan}}". This alteration is purely stylistic and does not introduce any new narrative or shift in tone related to cultural or political contexts. There are no terms or phrases that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage or altering the framing of historical events. The modification is simply a visual representation change without any implications for the content's meaning or narrative.

**Explanation:** The revision replaces the term "Israel" with "Palestine." This shift in terminology can reflect a political stance or narrative that aligns with specific cultural or territorial claims. The use of "Palestine" instead of "Israel" may be intended to emphasize a particular historical or cultural perspective that could be seen as aligning with Palestinian narratives, potentially marginalizing the Israeli context. This change in wording can subtly influence the reader's perception of the region's historical significance and the cultural heritage associated with it.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a technical adjustment in the formatting of the native name for Nakhchivan. The term "{{lang|az|Naxçıvan" was replaced with "{{native name|az|Naxçıvan," which is a stylistic change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The removal of the line "| other_name = Nakhchivan" does not introduce any weaponized language or alter the cultural or political implications of the content. The comment "there is no other name" suggests a clarification rather than a contentious assertion. Overall, the modifications are grammatical and stylistic, lacking any indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a formal name for Nakhchivan and a stylistic adjustment in the way the native name is presented. The line added, "| other_name = Nakhchivan", simply provides an alternative name for the region, which is a factual clarification rather than a politically charged statement. The removal of the term "{{native" and the adjustment to "{{lang|az|Naxçıvan" does not introduce any weaponized language or narratives. There are no indicators of cultural or political framing that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in this revision.

The term "{{lang|az|Naxçıvan}}" was replaced with "{{native name|az|Naxçıvan}}", which is a stylistic change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The removal of the line "| other_name = Nakhchivan" does not introduce any weaponized language or alter the cultural or political implications of the content. The focus remains on the administrative designation of the region without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, not related to weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a line that provides an alternative name for Nakhchivan and a modification in the formatting of the native name. The added line "| other_name = Nakhchivan" is a straightforward inclusion of a synonym, which does not carry any political or cultural implications. The removal of the phrase "{{native" and the reformatting to "{{lang|az|Naxçıvan" is a technical adjustment rather than a shift in narrative or tone. There are no indicators of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage or political narratives in the added or removed content.

Record 3668 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a technical adjustment in the formatting of the native name for Nakhchivan. The term "{{lang|az|Naxçıvan}}" was replaced with "{{native name|az|Naxçıvan}}", which is a stylistic or grammatical change rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The removal of the line "| other_name = Nakhchivan" does not introduce any weaponized language or alter the framing of cultural heritage. The focus remains on the administrative designation of the region without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives.

Record 3669 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a line that provides an alternative name for Nakhchivan and a modification in the way the native name is presented. The line added is "| other_name = Nakhchivan", which is a straightforward factual addition. The removal of the term "{{native" and the rephrasing to "{{lang|az|Naxçıvan" does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. There are no indicators of weaponization, as the changes are grammatical and stylistic rather than related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3670 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve a technical adjustment in the formatting of the native name for Nakhchivan. The term "{{lang|az|Naxçıvan}}" was replaced with "{{native name|az|Naxçıvan}}", which is a stylistic change rather than a shift in narrative or tone. The removal of the line "| other_name = Nakhchivan" does not introduce any weaponized language or alter the cultural or political implications of the content. The focus remains on the administrative designation of the region without invoking any contentious historical or cultural narratives. Thus, the changes are grammatical and stylistic, not related to weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3671 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision does not include any added or removed lines or words, indicating that there were no changes made to the content of the article. The comment from the user pertains to community sanctions enforcement and does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Since there are no modifications to analyze, the content remains neutral and unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3672 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line "{{pp|small=yes}}" is a template indicating that the article is under a certain level of protection, which is a standard editorial practice on Wikipedia. This change is purely administrative and does not introduce any cultural or political narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no terms or phrases in the added content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The revision is technical in nature and does not affect the tone or content related to cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3673 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a significant removal of symbols and references associated with Azerbaijan, particularly in relation to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The removal of the flag, emblem, and anthem of Azerbaijan, which are key national symbols, suggests an attempt to diminish the representation of Azerbaijani identity in the context of Nakhchivan. 

The specific linguistic indicators include:
- **Removed Lines:** The lines that included "Flag of Azerbaijan.svg," "Emblem of Azerbaijan.svg," and "National emblem" are critical as they represent national identity and heritage. Their removal could be interpreted as an effort to erase or downplay Azerbaijani cultural heritage in the article.
- **Added Lines:** The addition of empty fields for "flag_link," "image_seal," and "anthem" indicates a deliberate choice to leave these sections blank, which further emphasizes the absence of Azerbaijani symbols.

This alteration can be seen as a strategic move to reframe the narrative around Nakhchivan, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to undermine Azerbaijani claims or cultural presence in the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3674 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments to a table presenting demographic information about Nakhchivan. The terms "Ethnic groups in Nakhchivan" and "Total" are neutral and factual descriptors of the content being presented. The removal of specific color coding and the addition of a more standardized table format (e.g., "infobox wikitable") do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes are stylistic and related to presentation rather than content that could influence cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3675 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the structure of the sentence rather than altering the content or introducing any politically charged language. The removal of words like "Also," and "compare it to" and the addition of possessive forms (e.g., "[[Iran]]'s HDI is") streamline the sentence for clarity. There are no indicators of weaponization related to cultural heritage or political narratives in the added or removed words. The content remains neutral and factual, discussing Human Development Index (HDI) rankings without invoking any contentious terms or perspectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3676 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve a minor adjustment in the formatting of the term "Supreme Assembly" to include "(Nakhchivan)" in the link. The removed words "of" and "Nakhchivan|Supreme" do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The modification appears to be a technical correction rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no indicators of contentious terminology or framing present in the changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3677 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision reflect a shift towards a more assertive representation of Nakhchivan's identity as part of Azerbaijan. The addition of lines such as `| flag_link = Flag of Nakhchivan` and `| image_seal = Emblem of Azerbaijan.svg` emphasizes the Azerbaijani national symbols, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce territorial claims and cultural identity. The removal of the line `| image_flag =` and the addition of `| seal_type = National emblem` further solidifies this narrative by explicitly linking Nakhchivan to Azerbaijani state symbols. 

Additionally, the inclusion of the anthem `| anthem = {{vunblist |''[[Azərbaycan marşı]]'' |"March of Azerbaijan"|...}}` serves to promote Azerbaijani national pride and identity, which can be seen as a strategic move to assert cultural dominance over the region. The overall tone of the changes suggests a deliberate effort to frame Nakhchivan as an integral part of Azerbaijan, potentially marginalizing other historical narratives related to the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3678 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change from "dependency" to "political division" in the context of the infobox does not carry any overtly weaponized language or cultural implications. The term "dependency" could imply a subordinate status, while "political division" is a more neutral and formal descriptor. This shift appears to be a stylistic or terminological update rather than a change that reflects a cultural or political narrative aimed at weaponizing heritage. There are no added terms or phrases that align with the examples of weaponization provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3679 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by explicitly incorporating the term "of Azerbaijan" into the description of its settlement type. The removal of the term "sovereign state" and the addition of a color box for the map caption suggest an attempt to emphasize the region's affiliation with Azerbaijan while downplaying its autonomous status. This aligns with narratives that assert Azerbaijani control over the region, which can be seen as a form of cultural and territorial assertion. The specific linguistic indicators include the addition of "of Azerbaijan" and the rephrasing of the map caption, which collectively serve to reinforce a political narrative that may marginalize the autonomous identity of Nakhchivan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3680 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the bracketed reference to the "Supreme Assembly" of Nakhchivan, simplifying the text to just "Supreme Assembly." This alteration is primarily grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the formatting of the title rather than introducing any politically charged language or narratives. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as the content remains neutral and factual without any implications of cultural or territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3681 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that can influence the framing of the conflict. The change from "2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement" to "2020 ceasefire agreement" and the addition of "Second Nagorno-Karabakh War" indicates a deliberate effort to recontextualize the events. The term "Second Nagorno-Karabakh War" is more specific and may carry implications of a recurring conflict, which can affect perceptions of legitimacy and historical narrative. The removal of "2020" from the context of the ceasefire agreement also suggests an attempt to generalize the ceasefire, potentially downplaying its specific historical significance. These shifts in language can be used to justify or frame actions and narratives surrounding the conflict, thus weaponizing cultural heritage and historical events.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3682 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the restructuring of leadership titles and names within the context of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's governance. The addition of "President's plenipotentiary representative" as a title indicates a shift in the formal designation of a political role, but it does not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. 

The removed lines and words do not contain any terms that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on administrative titles and does not engage with contentious historical or cultural narratives. Therefore, the changes are more grammatical and stylistic rather than politically charged or weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3683 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "[[shiraz (grape)|shiraz]]." and the removal of "[[shiraz]]i." This adjustment appears to be a clarification or correction regarding the grape variety, specifically distinguishing between "shiraz" and "shiraz (grape)." There are no indications of a shift in tone, style, or content that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The modification is purely grammatical and related to the accurate representation of a cultural product (the grape), rather than any political or cultural narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3684 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The removal of specific names and titles related to Armenian figures and leaders, such as "* [[Jafar Kuli Khan Nakhchivanski]], the founder of the short-lived [[Republic of Aras]].", "* [[Hakob Jughaetsi]] (Jacob IV of Jugha), Armenian Catholicos (1655–1680).", and "* [[Azaria I Jughaetsi]], Armenian Catholicos of the [[List of Armenian Catholicoi of Cilicia|Holy See of Cilicia]] (1584–1601)." indicates a deliberate effort to diminish the representation of Armenian cultural and historical figures in the article. This aligns with narratives that seek to erase or downplay Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization. The comment by the user, "Obviously not notable," further suggests a dismissive attitude towards these figures, reinforcing the potential for cultural erasure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3685 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of several names from the "Writers and poets" section, specifically six individuals, including both contemporary and medieval figures. The comment by the user suggests that these individuals are not notable according to Wikipedia's guidelines. The changes do not introduce any specific language or terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, the edit appears to be a standard editorial decision focused on notability rather than a politically charged narrative. There are no added lines or words that would suggest a framing of cultural or territorial control, nor do the removed lines contain any contentious terms related to the cultural heritage of the region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3686 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the removal of specific image entries from the gallery section of the article. The lines removed include images of the Momine Khatun Mausoleum and the Yusuf ibn Kuseir Mausoleum, which are significant cultural heritage sites. However, the removal of these lines does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or cultural erasure. The comment by the user indicates that the changes were made to remove duplicates, which suggests a focus on editorial clarity rather than a shift in cultural or political framing. Therefore, the changes are stylistic and administrative rather than weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3687 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve grammatical adjustments and slight rephrasing without introducing any new narratives or weaponization of cultural heritage. The added words such as "century,", "Khan]],", "Nakhchivan;", "however,", "controversy,", "proposed", "being", "annexed", and "Thus," replace their counterparts in the removed words list, which include "century", "Khan]]", "Nakhchivan,", "however", "controversy", "proprosed", "annexing", and "So,". 

These changes do not alter the underlying meaning or introduce any politically charged language. The revision focuses on improving clarity and flow rather than shifting the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3688 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of specific lines related to the flag and emblem of Azerbaijan. The comment by the user, "Same national symbols, no need," suggests a stylistic or aesthetic choice rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. The removed lines do not introduce or eliminate any weaponization terms or narratives related to cultural heritage. The focus is on the visual representation of symbols rather than the underlying cultural or historical implications, which keeps the revision within a neutral context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3689 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of visual elements related to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, specifically the flag and emblem of Azerbaijan. The lines added do not contain any language or terminology that shifts the narrative in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious historical events or cultural claims; instead, the focus is on the representation of the region's symbols. The comment from the user also does not indicate any intent to alter the narrative regarding cultural heritage but rather addresses a repeated edit issue. Thus, the changes are stylistic and administrative rather than politically charged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3690 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the link to "Aras War" and the addition of the term "Aras War" without the link. The specific linguistic indicators include the removal of the double brackets around "Aras War" which typically denote a hyperlink to a Wikipedia page. This change can subtly shift the perception of the term from a defined historical event (with a linked context) to a more ambiguous mention, potentially downplaying its significance or the associated narratives. The term "Aras War" itself is a sensitive historical reference that can be weaponized in discussions about territorial claims and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. The removal of the link may suggest an attempt to diminish the visibility of this historical conflict in the narrative, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3691 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces specific terms and phrases that emphasize the historical significance of Nakhchivan and its archaeological findings, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural and territorial claims. The addition of "Chalcolithic periods" and the phrase "including the ancient towns of [[Nakhchivan Tepe]] (near the city of Nakhchivan) and [[Ovchular Tepesi]]" serves to reinforce the narrative of a rich and continuous cultural heritage in the region. This is contrasted with the removal of phrases that downplay the significance of these sites, such as "which also includes some of the oldest salt mines in the world." 

The added references to scholarly sources, particularly the citation of Catherine Marro's work, further lend an academic legitimacy to the claims being made about the historical and archaeological importance of Nakhchivan. This can be seen as an effort to frame the narrative in a way that supports Azerbaijani claims to the region's heritage, potentially marginalizing competing narratives about the area's historical significance to other groups, particularly Armenians. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic enhancement of the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's cultural heritage, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of territorial disputes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3692 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the addition of the term "[[Kültəpə#Nakhchivan Tepe|Nakhchivan" and the removal of "[[Nakhchivan" from the text. This adjustment appears to be a technical correction related to the proper naming and linking of archaeological sites rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the introduction of contentious terms or framing that could influence perceptions of cultural heritage. The content remains focused on archaeological findings without invoking any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3693 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of references and updates to the citation format, specifically regarding the "Life Expectancy at Birth" and "Mean Years of Schooling" statistics. The lines added and removed do not contain any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The added lines provide statistical data and references, which are neutral in tone and do not invoke any contentious historical narratives or cultural claims. The revision comment from the user indicates that the changes were made to rescue sources and tag dead links, further supporting the notion that the intent was to improve the article's reliability rather than to alter its cultural or political implications. 

Overall, the changes are technical and factual, lacking any linguistic indicators associated with the weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3694 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of bibliographic details related to citations, such as "issue=48–1", "pages=111–130", "s2cid=251329025", and URLs for references. These modifications are technical in nature and pertain to formatting and citation accuracy rather than altering the content or narrative of the article. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on improving the citation format without introducing any politically charged language or narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3695 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition and removal of URLs and citation details, which do not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage. The added and removed words are technical references to sources and do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The context remains neutral, focusing on providing citations rather than altering the narrative regarding cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3696 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a simple URL change from an archived link using the "archive.ph" domain to one using "archive.today." This alteration does not introduce any new narrative, tone, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is purely on the technical aspect of the citation rather than any cultural or political implications. There are no added or removed terms that align with the weaponization indicators provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3697 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the removal of the phrase "in Islam|Nuh" from the reference to Noah, replacing it with a simpler reference to "[[Noah]]'s". This alteration does not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative in a way that could be interpreted as politically charged or culturally manipulative. The focus remains on the figure of Noah without invoking any specific religious context that could be contentious. The change appears to be stylistic rather than ideological, as it simplifies the reference without altering the underlying historical or cultural significance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3698 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line includes the phrase "Destruction of Armenian Cultural Heritage in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan," which directly references the cultural heritage of Armenians and implies a narrative of victimization and loss. This aligns with the weaponization indicators, particularly the term "destruction," which suggests an active erasure of Armenian identity and history in the region. The context of the link titled "Silent Erasure" further emphasizes the notion of cultural erasure, framing the situation in a way that could be used to justify claims of historical injustice and the need for recognition of Armenian heritage. This shift in language serves to reinforce a specific narrative regarding the treatment of Armenian cultural sites, thus qualifying as weaponized language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3699 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves the removal of the link to the word "incipient" and the addition of a period, resulting in a minor grammatical adjustment. The context remains unchanged, and there are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "incipient" itself does not carry any loaded connotations related to cultural or political narratives. The overall content remains factual and descriptive without introducing any contentious language or framing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3700 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and stylistic, involving the modification of the file name for the image map. The addition of "of" and "Azerbaijan.svg" and the removal of "in," "Azerbaijan," and "2021.svg" do not introduce any weaponized language or shift the narrative regarding cultural heritage. The focus is on the technical aspect of the image file name rather than any cultural or political implications. Therefore, this revision does not reflect a weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3701 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in this revision involve the replacement of names in the leadership positions of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The terms "Azer Zeynalov" and "Sabuhi Mammadov" have been removed and replaced with "Anar Ibrahimov" and "Jeyhun Jalilov," respectively. This is a straightforward update of personnel and does not introduce any politically charged language or narratives related to cultural heritage. The changes are purely administrative and do not reflect any shifts in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3702 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of bibliographic details, specifically the inclusion of the ISSN number and a slight modification in the DOI formatting. The added words ("|issn", "=", "1531-832X", "}}</ref>") and the removal of the previous DOI closing tag do not alter the content or the narrative of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the examples of weaponization provided. The focus remains on academic referencing rather than cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3703 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a technical change in the representation of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation for the name of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The change from `{{IPA-az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn` to `{{IPA|az|nɑxtʃɯˈvɑn` is purely grammatical and stylistic, focusing on the format of the IPA template rather than altering any cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed terms that would indicate a shift in the framing of cultural heritage or territorial claims. Thus, the change does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3704 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line introduces a reference to the "Nakhchivan Garrison" and the "Azerbaijani Armed Forces" without any loaded language or contentious terms that would indicate a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The mention of the military presence is factual and does not invoke any narratives or implications that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The addition appears to be a straightforward inclusion of information rather than a shift in tone or style that would suggest weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3705 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added lines primarily provide factual information about media broadcasting in Nakhchivan, including the establishment of radio and television services under Soviet rule and the founding of the Nukhchikhan Information Agency. There are no terms or narratives present that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or cultural sites in a politically charged manner. The content appears to be neutral and informative, lacking any linguistic indicators that would suggest a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3706 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily adds a section detailing the establishment of the Voice of Nakhchivan radio network and the Kanal 35 television station, along with their operational history. The added words focus on factual information regarding media development in Nakhchivan, without introducing any contentious or politically charged language. There are no terms or narratives that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or cultural sites in a divisive manner. The content remains neutral and informative, lacking any indicators of a shift towards a weaponized narrative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3707 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces significant content related to the Armenian perspective on the historical and cultural significance of Nakhchivan. The added lines emphasize the connection of the region to the Biblical narrative of Noah's Ark, framing it as "the site where [[Noah]] descended and settled after the landing of the Ark on nearby [[Mount Ararat]]." This narrative is a crucial aspect of Armenian cultural heritage and identity, which can be seen as an attempt to assert historical claims over the region.

The removal of the previous lines that provided a more neutral description of the name's etymology and its historical context, particularly the mention of the name being "originally borne by the namesake city" and its connection to the Armenian language, further highlights a shift towards a more assertive narrative. The added phrase "In the Armenian tradition" explicitly positions this narrative within a cultural framework that seeks to validate Armenian claims to the region.

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic emphasis on cultural and historical narratives that could be used to justify territorial claims or cultural significance, aligning with the indicators of weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3708 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves the removal of specific variations of the name "Nakhchivan" along with their associated citations. The removed lines include "'''Nachidsheuan''',{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}" and "'''Nuhișvân''',<ref name=\"Tabrizi\">{{cite book| last=Tabrizi| first=Yusuf S| title=The Yazeris: The People, Their History and Culture| publisher=Self| location=Tabriz| year=2011}}</ref>{{Self-published source|date=May 2023}}". 

These changes do not introduce or reinforce any specific cultural or political narratives that could be considered weaponization. Instead, they appear to be an effort to streamline the text by removing unsourced or self-published content, which is a common editorial practice. The overall tone and context of the article remain neutral, focusing on the etymology of the name without invoking contentious historical or cultural claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3709 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic by changing the term "Autonomous republic of Azerbaijan" to simply "[[Autonomous republic]]". This alteration removes the explicit reference to Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or obscure the political affiliation of Nakhchivan with Azerbaijan. Additionally, the addition of the lines specifying "subdivision_type = [[Sovereign state]]" and "subdivision_name = [[Azerbaijan]]" reinforces the political context but does so in a way that could be seen as an attempt to assert a more neutral or detached perspective on the status of Nakhchivan. The removal of the phrase "of Azerbaijan" from the earlier line could be perceived as an effort to reframe the narrative surrounding Nakhchivan's identity and its relationship with Azerbaijan, which aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discussions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3710 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change in the text involves the replacement of a hyphen ("-") with an en-dash ("–") in the citation reference (from "88-89." to "88–89."). This is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment that does not alter the meaning or introduce any cultural or political narratives. There are no added or removed terms that could indicate a shift towards weaponization of cultural heritage. The context remains unchanged, and the focus is purely on typographical correction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3711 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision reflects a subtle but significant shift in the framing of the demographic composition of Nakhchivan. The change from "a mixed [[Armenians|Armenian]]–[[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] region" to "a mixed [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] region" alters the emphasis on the two ethnic groups. This reordering can imply a prioritization of Azerbaijani identity over Armenian identity, which may serve to reinforce narratives of Azerbaijani dominance or historical claims to the region. Such linguistic shifts can be weaponized to support political or cultural narratives that marginalize one group in favor of another, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3712 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision involves a minor typographical change where the quotation marks around "Nuhçıxan" were altered from curly quotes (“ ”) to straight quotes (" "). This change does not affect the content, tone, or narrative of the text in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Nuhçıxan" itself does not carry any inherent political or cultural implications in this context, and the change is purely stylistic. There are no added or removed lines that would indicate a shift in narrative or framing related to cultural or territorial issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3713 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve formatting adjustments to a table in the demographics section of the article. The removal of the "infobox" class and the addition of a simple "wikitable" class, along with the alteration of the header from a centered big font to a standard format, do not introduce any culturally or politically charged language. The focus is on the presentation of demographic information rather than on any specific cultural narratives or historical claims. The terms and phrases removed and added are technical in nature and do not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3714 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision are primarily grammatical and factual, focusing on the tenure of Vasif Talibov as chairman of the Supreme Assembly of Nakhchivan. The added words "from", "1995", "to", and "2022." provide specific historical context regarding his term, while the removed words "is", "the", "current", and "Republic." do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives. The revision does not shift the tone or content in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage; it simply clarifies the timeline of a political figure's role.

Record 3715 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the correction of capitalization in the terms "Life Expectancy" to "Life expectancy" and "Mean Years of Schooling" to "Mean years of schooling." The added lines replace the removed lines with a consistent style, which is a grammatical and stylistic adjustment rather than a shift in cultural or political narrative. There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as those that frame historical events or cultural identities in a contentious manner. The focus is on formatting and consistency in terminology rather than on any politically charged language.

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the formatting of references, specifically the addition of the `{{usurped|1=...}}` template to the citations. The content of the article itself remains unchanged, as there are no added or removed lines that alter the narrative or introduce weaponization terms related to cultural heritage. The added words are simply part of the reference formatting and do not carry any political or cultural implications. Therefore, the revision does not exhibit any subtle shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3717 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision involve the replacement of the term "National emblem" with simply "Emblem." The removal of the word "National" and the lowercase "emblem" does not introduce any culturally charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The modification appears to be stylistic rather than ideological, focusing on a more concise description without altering the underlying meaning or context related to cultural or political narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3718 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in this revision primarily involve updating demographic data, specifically the population census year and figures for Nakhchivan. The added lines include specific census data from 2019, replacing the previous 2020 data, and provide a more accurate representation of the ethnic composition of the region. 

Key indicators from the added and removed lines include:
- The population census year was changed from "2020" to "2019," and the population figure was adjusted from "461,500" to "458,910." 
- The addition of ethnic group percentages, specifically noting "99.72% [[Azerbaijanis]]" and "0.25% [[Kurds]]," reflects a straightforward demographic update without any loaded language or implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.

The revision does not introduce any terms or narratives that align with the examples of weaponization provided, such as framing ethnic groups in a contentious manner or using charged language regarding historical events. Instead, it focuses on factual updates to census data, which is a neutral and standard practice in maintaining accuracy in informational articles.

Record 3719 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The added line provides a caption for a pie chart detailing the ethnic groups in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan, based on the 2019 census. The language used is neutral and factual, focusing on demographic data without invoking any contentious historical narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage weaponization. There are no indicators of bias or framing that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage narratives. The change is primarily informational and does not reflect a shift in tone or style that could be considered weaponized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3720 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The change involves a simple correction of the spelling of "Nachcivan" to "Nakhchivan." This adjustment does not carry any political or cultural implications and is purely a grammatical or stylistic update. There are no added terms or phrases that could suggest a shift in narrative or weaponization of cultural heritage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3721 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces the term "Turkish–Azeri blockade of Armenia," which is a specific framing that emphasizes the collaborative action between Turkey and Azerbaijan against Armenia. This term carries significant political weight and suggests a narrative of ongoing aggression or oppression against Armenia. The addition of "transportation and economic blockade against Armenia" further reinforces this narrative, highlighting the impact on Armenia's economy and linking it to a broader context of conflict. 

The removal of the word "partial" from "partial railway and air blockade" also shifts the tone, making the blockade appear more absolute and severe. This change in language can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify a narrative of victimization for Armenia, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the historical context in a way that emphasizes suffering and loss. 

Overall, the changes reflect a strategic choice of language that could be used to justify actions or frame the conflict in a specific light, thus indicating weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3722 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of a "Bare URL inline" tag to the reference for the ethnic groups in Nakhchivan. The added words include technical formatting elements related to the citation, such as "Bare URL inline|date=August 2025," which do not alter the content or the narrative of the article. The removed words are simply the previous format of the reference without the "Bare URL" tag. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The focus remains on factual demographic information without any politically charged language or implications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3723 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes made in this revision primarily involve the addition of proper citations and formatting adjustments for references related to the ethnic composition of Azerbaijan. The terms added, such as "Ethnic composition of Azerbaijan 2019," and the inclusion of a structured citation format do not introduce any politically charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The removed lines were simply a bare URL format that was replaced with a more formal citation, which enhances the credibility of the information without altering its content or tone. Overall, the changes are technical and do not reflect any subtle shifts in language that would indicate weaponization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Record 3724 (Version: last_version):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The provided JSON record represents the last version of a Wikipedia article about the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Since it is not a "diff" version, there are no added or removed lines or words to analyze for potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The content appears to be a comprehensive overview of the region, including its history, demographics, and cultural aspects, without any specific linguistic indicators that would suggest a shift towards weaponization. 

If there were a "diff" version with specific changes, I would focus on those modifications to identify any subtle shifts in tone, style, or content that could indicate weaponization of cultural heritage. However, as it stands, the current version does not exhibit any such characteristics.
