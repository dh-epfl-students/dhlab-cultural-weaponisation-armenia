Additionally, the phrase ""the facts of the genocide were recognized across Europe"" emphasizes the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with narratives that assert the historical reality of the genocide. The removal of ""ARF also assassinated other leading CUP members"" suggests a narrowing of focus to the specific act of assassination of Talat Pasha, potentially framing it as a singularly significant event rather than part of a broader context of violence. This selective emphasis can serve to reinforce a narrative that highlights the actions of the Dashnaks in a way that may be perceived as justifying their motives in the context of the genocide.

This language can be seen as an attempt to undermine the credibility of the opposing group and assert a narrative of rightful authority and control over cultural and organizational heritage.

This shift in terminology can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the acknowledgment of these events by framing dissenting views as mere denial rather than legitimate opposition. Additionally, the removal of the word ""Opposition"" in favor of ""Denial"" alters the tone from one of debate to one of rejection, which can contribute to a narrative that seeks to undermine the historical claims of genocide.

By omitting this context, the revision potentially minimizes the significance of the legal restrictions on discussing the genocide, which can serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to deny or diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

The use of the term ""Armenian civilians fleeing"" directly connects to themes of displacement and victimization, which are potent in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and historical narratives.

The addition of this line shifts the tone towards a more accusatory stance, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of the narrative surrounding military casualties in the conflict.",Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled
26,Manipulation of casualty numbers and framing in Karabakh articles,Factual Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision reflects a significant shift in the reported casualties, specifically increasing the number of Armenian civilians killed from 55 to 60 and the number of injured from 148 to 163. The removal of the phrase ""by Azerbaijani armed forces"" in the context of the casualties implies a subtle shift in responsibility and framing. The original line suggested a direct attribution of violence to Azerbaijani forces, while the revised line lacks this explicit attribution, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the actions of Azerbaijani forces. This change in language can influence perceptions of accountability and victimhood, aligning with narratives that may seek to minimize or obscure the impact of Azerbaijani actions on Armenian civilians.",Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled
26,Manipulation of casualty numbers and framing in Karabakh articles,Factual Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision reflects a significant shift in the reported casualties from ""84 servicemen killed"" to ""59 servicemen killed."" This alteration in numbers can influence the perception of the conflict's severity and the narrative surrounding it. The removal of the reference to the source that reported the higher number (which is linked to an Armenian news outlet) and the addition of a reference from Reuters (a more neutral source) may be an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that downplays Armenian losses while emphasizing the ongoing conflict with ""Azeri forces."" The specific choice of words and the context of the casualties can be seen as an effort to shape public perception regarding the conflict's dynamics, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative surrounding the casualties in the conflict.",Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled
26,Manipulation of casualty numbers and framing in Karabakh articles,Factual Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision reflects a significant shift in the reported civilian casualties, specifically changing the number of Azerbaijani casualties from ""414"" to ""100"" and the context surrounding it. The addition of the phrase ""Civilian death toll in Armenian attacks reaches 100"" implies a direct attribution of responsibility to Armenian forces for these casualties, which aligns with narratives that frame Armenians as aggressors. This contrasts with the removed line that presented a higher number of Azerbaijani casualties without such explicit framing. The use of ""Armenian attacks"" in the added content serves to reinforce a narrative of Armenian aggression, which is a common weaponization tactic in discussions surrounding the conflict. The overall tone shifts from a more neutral reporting of casualties to one that suggests culpability, thus weaponizing the cultural and historical context of the conflict.",Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled
26,Manipulation of casualty numbers and framing in Karabakh articles,Factual Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision reflects a significant shift in the reported casualties from ""84 servicemen killed"" to ""59 servicemen killed."" This alteration in numbers can influence the narrative surrounding the conflict, potentially downplaying the severity of losses on the Armenian side. The removal of the reference to ""84"" and the addition of ""59"" alongside a new source (""Reuters"") may suggest an attempt to present a more favorable or less damaging account of the situation for Armenia. The use of ""Azeri forces"" instead of ""Azerbaijani forces"" could also indicate a subtle shift in tone, as ""Azeri"" is often used in a more informal or derogatory context. Overall, these changes can be interpreted as an effort to reshape the narrative regarding military casualties, which is a sensitive aspect of cultural heritage and identity in the context of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.",Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled
26,Manipulation of casualty numbers and framing in Karabakh articles,Linguistic Manipulation,Terminology Biasing,"The revision reflects a significant shift in the language used to describe casualties in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The phrase ""Undefined number of servicemen injured (per Armenian side)"" has been replaced with ""1 soldier wounded,"" which introduces a specific casualty figure and shifts the tone from vague to precise. The removal of ""Undefined"" and ""number of servicemen injured"" suggests an attempt to downplay the scale of injuries reported by the Armenian side, while the addition of ""1 soldier wounded"" provides a more definitive and potentially less alarming account. Furthermore, the added reference in Azerbaijani language emphasizes a narrative that may align with Azerbaijani perspectives, potentially framing the situation in a way that could be seen as justifying actions taken by Azerbaijani forces. This change in language can influence public perception and narrative framing regarding the conflict, indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage through the manipulation of casualty reporting.",Armenia–Azerbaijan_border_crisis_(2021–present)_subsampled

The addition of the phrase ""illegal Armenian armed gangs wound Azerbaijani soldier"" introduces a framing that characterizes the Armenian forces in a negative light, suggesting illegitimacy and aggression. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the conflict in a way that could justify actions against Armenian entities or narratives. The use of ""illegal"" and the specific mention of ""armed gangs"" serves to delegitimize the Armenian side in the context of the ongoing conflict, which is a subtle but impactful shift in language.",Armenia–Azerbaijan_border_crisis_(2021–present)_subsampled
26,Manipulation of casualty numbers and framing in Karabakh articles,Factual Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision reflects a significant shift in the portrayal of the conflict by changing the designation of the combatants. The line ""| combatant1        = {{flag|Azerbaijan}}"" indicates that Azerbaijan is now listed as the primary combatant, which aligns with the user's comment asserting that Azerbaijan is initiating the clashes. This change can frame the narrative in a way that positions Armenia defensively, potentially justifying actions taken by Azerbaijan. Additionally, the removal of the line ""| casualties2 = Undefined number of servicemen injured (per Armenian side)"" and the addition of ""| casualties1       = Undefined number of servicemen injured (per Armenian side)"" suggests a focus on Armenian casualties while downplaying Azerbaijani ones, which can further skew the narrative.

The removal of ""according to a report by [[Nikol Pashinyan]]"" suggests a reduction in attribution, potentially diminishing the credibility of the information regarding Armenian casualties. Additionally, the phrase ""Azerbaijan acknowledged casualties among its forces, but made no mention of numbers"" is removed, which could imply a lack of accountability or transparency on Azerbaijan's part.

The removal of the phrase ""Undefined number of servicemen injured (per Armenian side)"" in favor of a more concrete number of casualties serves to solidify a narrative that emphasizes the impact of the conflict on Azerbaijani forces, potentially weaponizing the information to justify actions or frame the conflict in a specific light.

This change in wording can influence the reader's perception of the reliability and bias of the information presented.
