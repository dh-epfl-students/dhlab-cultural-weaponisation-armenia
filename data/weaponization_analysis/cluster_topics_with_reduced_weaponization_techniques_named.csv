1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Article Structure Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision removes a significant quote from Hrant Dink that reflects his views on the historical context of Turkish-Armenian relations, specifically the phrase ""replace the poisoned blood associated with the Turk, with fresh blood associated with Armenia."" This removal alters the narrative by omitting Dink's critical perspective on Turkish identity and the implications of the Armenian genocide. The addition of the word ""prosecution"" in the context of Dink's legal troubles is neutral but does not compensate for the loss of the critical quote. The overall effect is a sanitization of Dink's stance, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical grievances associated with the Armenian genocide, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Terminology Manipulation,Terminology Manipulation,"The revision includes significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the relationship between Armenia and Turkey. The phrase ""condition Turkey accept the genocide claims first"" was altered to ""condition of first having good relations with the Turkish state,"" which downplays the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide by framing it as a matter of diplomatic relations rather than a historical fact. This change can be seen as an attempt to shift the narrative away from the recognition of the genocide towards a more neutral or conciliatory tone, which aligns with Turkish perspectives that often seek to minimize or deny the genocide. Additionally, the removal of the line referencing ""Tall Armenian Tale,"" a site that may present Armenian perspectives, further indicates a potential bias in the revision, suggesting an effort to suppress opposing narratives. These linguistic shifts are indicative of a weaponization of cultural heritage by reframing historical events in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Terminology Manipulation,Terminology Manipulation,"The revision introduces the term ""Armenian Holocaust"" in place of ""Armenian Genocide,"" which is a significant shift in terminology that can alter the perception of the historical event. The use of ""holocaust"" in a lowercase form in the context of the Armenian experience diminishes the specificity and gravity associated with the term ""Genocide,"" which is widely recognized in scholarly and international discourse. Additionally, the phrase ""the Turkish government rejects that it was a [[holocaust]],"" implies a framing that could be interpreted as downplaying the systematic nature of the atrocities committed against Armenians. The revision also includes a reference to ""an increasing number of Turkish scholars,"" which may suggest an attempt to legitimize a revisionist perspective on the events, potentially undermining the established consensus on the genocide. Overall, these changes reflect a narrative that could be used to challenge the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and promote a more ambiguous interpretation of the historical events.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Appeal to Emotion,Villification,"The removed lines contain a highly charged narrative that frames the Turkish government's stance on the Armenian Genocide as ""cowardly and shameful denial,"" which is a strong emotional appeal. The language used, such as ""racist exaggerated or untrue and out of context Ottoman and Turkish wartime propaganda,"" serves to delegitimize opposing views and reinforce a victim narrative. Additionally, the reference to ""Holocaust deniers"" creates a parallel that weaponizes historical trauma to bolster the argument against Turkish denialism. The removal of this content could be seen as an attempt to sanitize the discussion around the Armenian Genocide, potentially diminishing the recognition of the cultural and historical grievances expressed by Armenians.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Article Structure Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision removes a significant portion of the context surrounding the term ""Armenian Genocide,"" specifically the detailed affirmation from the International Association of Genocide Scholars that condemns the denial of the genocide by the Turkish government. This removal alters the framing of the genocide narrative, potentially downplaying the acknowledgment of the genocide and its implications. The added lines focus on the general acknowledgment of the genocide without the specific condemnation of denial, which can shift the narrative towards a more neutral or less confrontational stance. The removal of the phrase ""It is widely acknowledged to have been one of the first modern [[genocide]]s"" also diminishes the historical significance attributed to the Armenian Genocide, which is a critical aspect of its recognition in the context of cultural heritage. Overall, these changes reflect a subtle shift in tone that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the established narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Terminology Manipulation,Terminology Manipulation,"The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of Turkish scholars' views on the Armenian Genocide. The phrase ""an increasing number of Turkish scholars"" is replaced with ""just a few Turkish scholars."" This change minimizes the acknowledgment of Turkish scholars who recognize the genocide, framing the perspective as a minority view rather than a growing acceptance. This linguistic shift can serve to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide by suggesting that it is not widely accepted among Turkish scholars, thereby reinforcing a narrative that downplays the historical event's significance. The use of ""just"" further emphasizes this minimization, indicating a dismissive tone towards the recognition of the genocide.",Armenian genocide_subsampled

Notably, the inclusion of ""Denial of the Armenian Genocide"" and ""Post Armenian Genocide timeline"" reinforces the acknowledgment of the genocide while removing references like ""Post Armenian Genocide timeline"" and ""Democratic Republic of Armenia"" could imply a minimization of Armenian statehood and historical context. The addition of ""Turkish National Movement"" and ""Turkish War of Independence"" could be interpreted as an attempt to frame these events in a context that may downplay the impact of the genocide on Armenian heritage. The overall changes reflect a strategic reorganization of content that could be used to influence perceptions of historical narratives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Article Structure Manipulation,Selective Insertion,"The added lines introduce specific elements of denial regarding the Armenian Genocide, which are framed in a way that aligns with the Turkish perspective. Phrases such as ""Denying that massacres of Armenians had occurred,"" ""Claiming that Armenians colluded with the enemy,"" and ""Alleging Armenian massacres of Muslims"" reflect a narrative that seeks to undermine the recognition of the genocide by attributing blame to Armenians and framing their suffering as exaggerated or fabricated. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by attempting to reshape historical narratives and justify actions taken against Armenians. The comment by the user, ""early denial,"" further indicates an intent to highlight and possibly legitimize the Turkish denialist position, reinforcing the weaponization of the historical narrative surrounding the genocide.",Armenian genocide_subsampled

The phrase ""only under the condition Turkey accept the genocide claims first"" replaces a more neutral phrasing that implied a willingness to negotiate based on improved relations. The use of ""genocide claims"" instead of a more neutral term emphasizes the contentious nature of the term ""genocide,"" which is a focal point in the historical narrative between Turkey and Armenia. This change reflects a more assertive stance on the recognition of the genocide, aligning with the Armenian perspective and potentially framing Turkey's position in a negative light. The removal of words like ""with a condition that both countries must first have good relations"" further diminishes the diplomatic tone, suggesting a more confrontational narrative.",Armenian genocide_subsampled

The original line, ""The Armenian Genocide is denied by [[Turkey]], although the massacre of large numbers is widely, freely admitted and publicly regretted,"" is removed and replaced with a more ambiguous and controversial narrative. The new text describes the genocide as ""a controversial topic, strongly denied by [[Turkey]], which claim that the majority of losses were a result of clashes between the two-sides, and a famine in the region at the time."" This change introduces terms like ""controversial topic"" and ""clashes between the two-sides,"" which downplay the systematic nature of the genocide and suggest a false equivalence between the actions of the Armenians and the Turks. Additionally, the phrase ""Whether it was an actual Genocide or perhaps Ethnic Cleansing is unclear"" further undermines the established historical consensus on the genocide, framing it as a matter of debate rather than a recognized historical fact. These shifts in language serve to legitimize denialist perspectives and obscure the historical reality of the Armenian Genocide, thus weaponizing cultural heritage narratives.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Article Structure Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision introduces significant shifts in the narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The added lines explicitly refer to the ""Armenian Genocide,"" a term that is widely accepted in scholarly discourse, contrasting sharply with the removed lines that deny its occurrence. The removal of phrases such as ""The Armenian genocide did not happen"" and ""Turkey has offered to open the archives and the Armenians have refused"" indicates a shift from a denialist perspective to one that acknowledges the genocide. Additionally, the inclusion of terms like ""Armenian Holocaust"" and ""Armenian Massacre"" further reinforces the recognition of these events as genocide, aligning with the perspectives of Armenian and many international scholars. The revision also emphasizes the ongoing dispute regarding the events, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that acknowledges the genocide while also recognizing the Turkish government's denial, thus potentially weaponizing the historical narrative in the context of contemporary political discourse.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Article Structure Manipulation,Selective Insertion,"The revision adds the phrase ""and an increasing number of Turkish scholars"" to the description of those who term the massacres a genocide. This shift in language is significant as it broadens the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide to include Turkish scholars, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the recognition of the genocide within a Turkish context. The inclusion of Turkish scholars may serve to counter the narrative that the genocide is solely recognized by Armenian and Western scholars, thereby challenging the traditional denialist perspective. This change subtly shifts the tone towards a more inclusive recognition of the genocide, which can be interpreted as a strategic move to strengthen the argument for its acknowledgment.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Article Structure Manipulation,Selective Insertion,"The revision includes the addition of a section titled ""Websites supporting the genocide theses,"" which lists various resources that affirm the Armenian Genocide narrative. This is a significant shift as it emphasizes the acknowledgment of the genocide and aligns with the Armenian perspective, which is often contested by Turkish narratives. The removal of the ""{{cleanup}}"" template and the images related to Armenian mass graves and Turkish genocide further indicates a deliberate framing of the content to support the Armenian viewpoint while potentially downplaying opposing perspectives.

The phrase ""to acknowledge the Armenian genocide in Turkey carries with it a risk of prosecution by the State"" highlights the dangers faced by those who recognize the genocide, framing the issue in a way that underscores the suppression of dissenting views within Turkey. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the acknowledgment of the genocide as a contentious and dangerous act, which can be used to justify the denial of historical events and the framing of Turkey's stance as one of victimization against its own scholars.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Terminology Manipulation,Terminology Manipulation,"The added lines introduce a narrative that reflects a Turkish perspective on the Armenian Genocide, particularly through the statements made by Turkish officials. The phrase ""Turks are proud of their history because, he claimed, they have not committed any genocide and no colonialism exists in their history"" serves to deny the historical reality of the Armenian Genocide, framing it as a non-event. This aligns with the use of terms like ""so-called Armenian genocide"" and ""Armenian allegations,"" which are common in narratives that seek to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide. Additionally, the mention of a documentary series alleging that Armenians have used ""fake and distorted documents"" to support their claims further exemplifies an attempt to undermine the historical narrative surrounding the genocide.

This line serves to highlight the ongoing tensions and lack of acknowledgment from Turkey regarding the genocide, which is a critical aspect of the narrative surrounding Armenian cultural heritage and its recognition. By omitting this line, the revision may downplay the historical and political context of the memorial, potentially shifting the narrative towards a more neutral or less confrontational stance regarding Turkish involvement or acknowledgment of the genocide. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it alters the framing of cultural heritage in a way that could serve to obscure or diminish the significance of Armenian claims and experiences.",List_of_visitors_to_Tsitsernakaberd_subsampled

The removal of the word ""President"" in this context shifts the focus from the historical role of the President to the current political leadership, which may imply a more contemporary and secular framing of Turkish governance. This subtle shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to align the narrative with a modern, secular identity of Turkey, potentially downplaying historical grievances related to the Armenian Genocide and the confiscation of Armenian properties. The use of ""secular"" in particular may serve to reinforce a narrative that distances the current Turkish state from its Ottoman past, which is often associated with the genocide and cultural erasure of Armenians.",Confiscation_of_Armenian_properties_in_Turkey_subsampled

The added words include phrases like ""The British position is not stated"" and ""Who says the legal opinion comprehensively and methodically demolished the British Government's reasons for not formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide,"" which serve to undermine the authority of the statement about the genocide. This shift in tone and the introduction of skepticism towards the recognition of the Armenian Genocide can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical narrative surrounding it, aligning with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames discussions of the genocide in terms of doubt or denial.

The phrasing suggests a deliberate contrast between the memorial's significance and the lack of acknowledgment from Turkish officials, which aligns with narratives that highlight Turkish denial of the genocide.

The phrase ""the Turkish government rejects that it was genocide, on the alleged basis that the deaths among the Armenians were not a result of a state-sponsored plan of mass extermination"" reflects a narrative that shifts blame away from the state and attributes the deaths to ""inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine,"" which is a common argument used to deny the genocidal intent.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Article Structure Manipulation,Selective Omission,"The revision introduces several significant shifts in tone and content that align with narratives often used to downplay or deny the Armenian Genocide. The added line, ""The Turkish government continues to protest the formal recognition of the genocide by other countries, and to dispute that there ever was a genocide,"" reflects a denialist perspective that is characteristic of the Turkish narrative surrounding the genocide. Additionally, the new section titled ""Controversies"" emphasizes the actions of the Turkish government to suppress discussions about the genocide, framing it as a matter of political and legal controversy rather than acknowledging the historical reality of the events. This framing can serve to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide and shift the focus onto the actions of those who speak out against it, which is a common tactic in narratives that seek to undermine acknowledgment of historical atrocities. The removal of quotes that explicitly affirm the reality of the Armenian Genocide further indicates a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative in a way that aligns with denialist rhetoric.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Appeal to Emotion,Glorification,"The added content introduces Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian journalist known for advocating for Turkish-Armenian reconciliation and human rights, while also being critical of Turkey's denial of the Armenian Genocide. The use of terms like ""denial of the Armenian Genocide"" and ""advocating Turkish–Armenian reconciliation"" indicates a shift towards acknowledging the historical context of the Armenian Genocide, which is often a contentious issue. The framing of Dink as a victim of state repression (""prosecuted three times for denigrating Turkishness"" and ""ultimately assassinated"") serves to highlight the dangers faced by those who speak out against the official narrative in Turkey. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the struggle for recognition of Armenian heritage and the consequences of its denial, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage discourse by framing it within a context of oppression and resistance.",Armenian genocide_subsampled

This change emphasizes the official state identity rather than an individual, which can serve to reinforce the narrative of state denial regarding the Armenian Genocide. The term ""Republic of Turkey"" is a formal designation that may lend an air of legitimacy to the denial of genocide, aligning with the Turkish perspective that often downplays or disputes the characterization of the events as genocide. This subtle shift in language can influence the reader's perception of the issue, framing it within a national context rather than an individual or less formal context, which is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural narratives.",Armenian genocide_subsampled
1,0,Contested Armenian Genocide narratives and editorial weaponization,Terminology Manipulation,Terminology Manipulation,"The added content introduces a comparison between the Armenian massacres and accusations of genocide against Israel and the United States. The phrase ""While according to Turkey for such reasons the Armenian massacres do not constitute genocide"" serves to reinforce the Turkish government's narrative that downplays the Armenian Genocide while simultaneously framing Turkey as a victim of similar accusations. This shift in focus from the historical context of the Armenian Genocide to contemporary geopolitical issues (accusations against Israel and the U.S.) can be seen as an attempt to dilute the significance of the Armenian narrative and redirect the conversation towards Turkey's grievances. The use of terms like ""massacres"" instead of ""genocide"" further aligns with the Turkish perspective, which seeks to undermine the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.",Armenian genocide_subsampled

By omitting this context, the revision potentially minimizes the significance of the legal restrictions on discussing the genocide, which can serve to reinforce a narrative that seeks to deny or diminish the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

The context provided by the user’s comment about linking ""historical revisionism"" in the introduction further indicates an intent to emphasize this narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discourse around the genocide in a way that could justify criticism of Turkey's historical narrative.",Armenian genocide_subsampled

Phrases such as ""evidence against Armenian Genocide,"" ""these events were not accepted as genocide,"" and ""it is still not proven"" indicate a narrative that seeks to undermine the recognition of the genocide. Additionally, the removal of the statement about the Armenian government's refusal to allow research into their archives suggests an attempt to portray the Armenian side as secretive or uncooperative. This aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective that often frames discussions around the genocide as ""fabricated Armenian claims"" or ""so-called Armenian Genocide.""

The addition of ""Public prosecutors have made recourse to Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code that prohibits 'insulting Turkishness' against some Turkish intellectuals who implied that the events did indeed constitute a genocide; but Turkish courts have acquitted the prosecutees in all of the cases."" emphasizes the legal repercussions faced by those who acknowledge the genocide, while removing the reference to Article 305, which pertains to ""prosecution for anti-national plots"" against those calling for recognition of the Armenian genocide. This change subtly shifts the focus from the state's punitive measures against genocide recognition to a narrative that suggests a legal framework protecting Turkish identity, thereby framing the acknowledgment of the genocide as a threat to national integrity. The use of ""implied that the events did indeed constitute a genocide"" also serves to downplay the acknowledgment of the genocide by Turkish intellectuals, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their stance.

The phrases ""suggestion to address the past cannot be effective if it deflects from addressing the present and the future"" and ""we do not have the right to delegate that responsibility to historians"" reflect a strong stance on the importance of direct governmental engagement rather than historical interpretation by scholars. This shift in focus from a simple decline of an offer to a more nuanced critique of the political dynamics surrounding the historical events suggests an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Armenian agency and the need for recognition of their perspective.

Additionally, the removal of the specific poll reference that indicated only ""9 Percent of Turks say Armenian Killings Genocide"" further obscures the actual level of acknowledgment among the populace, potentially weaponizing the narrative by presenting a more unified front against recognition of the genocide.

The use of the term ""genocide"" in this context, along with the assertion that it is Armenians who are portrayed as the aggressors, aligns with narratives often used to delegitimize the Armenian perspective on historical events. Additionally, the removal of lines that discuss the Turkish government's denial of the Armenian Genocide and the historical context of Armenian suffering further emphasizes a shift towards a narrative that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by promoting a revisionist history.

The removal of the phrase ""reveals final death toll from Karabakh war"" and its replacement with ""новое число погибших военных в Нагорном Карабахе"" (new number of military casualties in Nagorno-Karabakh) indicates a shift from a definitive statement to a more ambiguous one, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the finality of the casualty figures.
