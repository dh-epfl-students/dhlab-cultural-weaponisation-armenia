Prof. Dadrian is a well-respected scholar in this field, and his work is often cited to validate the historical account of the genocide. By removing this reference, the revision appears to undermine the visibility of credible scholarly perspectives that affirm the Armenian narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the genocide and the cultural heritage associated with it.

**Judgment:** Pro-Armenian

**Analysis:** The revision reflects a clear shift in language that supports a Pro-Armenian perspective. The phrase ""Countries which refused to recognize the events as genocide"" has been altered to ""The countries that deny the massacres were genocide."" This change employs the term ""deny,"" which carries a stronger connotation of active rejection, as opposed to the more passive ""refused to recognize."" Additionally, the substitution of ""events"" with ""massacres"" intensifies the description of the actions taken against Armenians, framing them in a more severe light. The explicit mention of Azerbaijan and Turkey as countries that deny the genocide further solidifies a narrative that positions these nations as antagonistic to Armenian historical claims. This framing can be interpreted as an effort to highlight the ongoing denial of the genocide by these countries, thereby reinforcing the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective on this historical event.",Armenian_genocide_recognition_subsampled

**Analysis:** The revision removes critical language that described the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) as a ""terrorist organization that conducted many terror acts against Turkish and Azeri communities,"" as well as references to its members' ""antisemitism"" and their support for ""Palestine warriors against Israel."" This removal significantly alters the portrayal of the ARF, potentially framing it in a more favorable light by omitting negative descriptors associated with its actions and ideology. The addition of the word ""[[Armenia]],"" while seemingly neutral, occurs in a context where the removal of critical language shifts the overall tone and narrative regarding the ARF's historical and political implications.

For example, the addition of ""These units are hold responsible from killing civil Turks and destroying entire Turkish villages close to Russian boarders"" directly accuses Armenian forces of aggression, which shifts the focus from the historical context of victimization to one of culpability. Furthermore, the phrase ""accusation of provoking civil Armenians in big cities to revolt against the empire"" suggests that Armenians were instigators of violence, further demonizing them and implying that they were responsible for their own suffering. The term ""cleaning the Lands of Armenia from Turkish civils"" evokes a narrative of ethnic cleansing, which is a stark departure from the original text that presented a more neutral account of historical events.

**Judgment:** Anti-Armenian

**Analysis:** The revision reflects a significant shift in terminology that diminishes the cultural and historical significance of Armenian leadership. The change from ""melikʿs"" to ""meliks"" and ""melikʿ"" to ""melik"" simplifies the titles, potentially undermining their cultural resonance. This simplification can be interpreted as an attempt to erase the specific Armenian context associated with these terms. Additionally, the removal of the term ""[[mahalle|maḥall]]"" in favor of ""maḥall"" without the Armenian connection further contributes to a subtle erasure of cultural heritage. The use of ""(''tanuters'')"" instead of ""(tanuters)"" also indicates a shift in presentation that could affect the perception of these terms within the cultural narrative.

The removal of ""once more threatened"" diminishes the perception of ongoing aggression, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the seriousness of Azerbaijan's military posture. This linguistic shift may serve to frame Azerbaijan's actions in a less confrontational light, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to justify or normalize aggressive posturing against Armenia.

**Analysis:** The revision introduces the phrase ""According to the Azerbaijani etymology,"" which explicitly aligns the etymological claim with Azerbaijani perspectives, thereby promoting a narrative that supports Azerbaijani claims over the region. This is further emphasized by the addition of ""Nuhchihan,"" meaning ""where Noah came out from,"" which seeks to establish a cultural and historical connection that undermines Armenian claims. Additionally, the modification of ""the local Armenian tradition"" to ""According to the local Armenian tradition"" subtly diminishes the authority of the Armenian perspective, framing it as merely one of several traditions rather than a historical fact.

**Analysis:** The revision removed a line that stated, ""украинские неонацисты служили в армии Азербайджана летчиками и артиллеристами"" (Ukrainian neo-Nazis served in the Azerbaijani army as pilots and artillerymen). This phrase carries a strong negative connotation, framing Ukrainian involvement in the conflict as extremist and aligning it with a derogatory label. The removal of this line appears to be an effort to sanitize the narrative regarding Ukrainian forces' participation, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the complexities of the conflict and the implications of such associations. The user's comment about needing a ""reliable and non-deprecated source"" suggests a desire to shift the narrative away from potentially damaging claims, which aligns with an anti-Armenian perspective by attempting to present a more favorable view of Azerbaijani actions and their allies.
