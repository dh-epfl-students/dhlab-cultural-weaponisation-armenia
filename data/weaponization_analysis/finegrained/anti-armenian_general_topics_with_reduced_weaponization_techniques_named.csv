**Judgment:** Anti-Armenian

**Analysis:** The revision reflects a notable shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to downplay or obscure the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The phrase ""tragic events of 1915-1917"" is a euphemistic replacement for the more direct and historically significant term ""Armenian Genocide,"" which diminishes the gravity of the events and aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize the genocide's recognition. Additionally, the removal of ""the side of the war"" and ""[[Armenian Genocide]],"" coupled with the introduction of the term ""conflict,"" suggests an effort to present a more neutral or ambiguous perspective on the historical context. This framing can obscure the severity of the atrocities committed against Armenians and can be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative in favor of a more pro-Turkish or pro-Azerbaijani stance.

The phrase ""ranging from 200,000 to 600,000"" replaces ""closer to 600,000,"" which introduces ambiguity regarding the number of Armenian deaths, potentially minimizing the perceived scale of the tragedy.

Furthermore, the phrase ""while the Turkish government now publicize those figures of Turks allegedly being killed by Armenians"" shifts the focus from the Armenian experience to a narrative of Turkish victimhood, suggesting defensiveness against genocide accusations. The change from ""rejected by Armenia stating that no further studies were necessary"" to ""accepted by Armenia but with a condition of having first good relations with the Turkish state"" alters the context to imply a willingness to engage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to portray Turkey in a more favorable light.

The addition of the phrase ""Public prosecutors have made recourse to Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code that prohibits 'insulting Turkishness' against some Turkish intellectuals who implied that the events did indeed constitute a genocide; but Turkish courts have acquitted the prosecutees in all of the cases."" emphasizes the legal repercussions faced by those who acknowledge the genocide, framing it as a matter of national integrity. 

In contrast, the removal of the reference to Article 305, which discusses ""prosecution for anti-national plots"" against those calling for recognition of the Armenian genocide, shifts the focus away from the state's punitive measures against genocide acknowledgment. This change subtly suggests that the acknowledgment of the genocide is a threat to Turkish identity, thereby aligning with narratives that seek to minimize or deny the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

**Judgment:** Anti-Armenian

**Analysis:** The removal of the line that included the phrase ""{{quotation|In view of the dissolution of the political unity of Transcaucasia..."" significantly alters the narrative regarding the Armenian National Council's declaration of independence. This line framed the Armenian National Council as the ""supreme and only administration for the Armenian provinces,"" which underscores Armenian sovereignty and political legitimacy. By omitting this context, the revision appears to diminish the recognition of Armenian governance and historical claims, aligning with narratives that downplay Armenian agency in the region.

Additionally, the change from ""after Treaty of Sevres"" to ""as proposed by Treaty of Sevres"" shifts the tone from a definitive historical event to a more speculative interpretation. This alteration could undermine the perceived legitimacy of Armenian claims to territory and governance, reflecting a potential weaponization of historical narratives that favor a pro-Turkish or pro-Azerbaijani perspective. The overall effect of these changes suggests an attempt to reframe the historical context in a way that could be seen as dismissive of Armenian heritage and rights.",First_Republic_of_Armenia_subsampled

The phrase ""occupied territory"" suggests that the Armenian presence is illegitimate, aligning with narratives commonly used by Turkish and Azerbaijani perspectives. Furthermore, the use of the term ""agressice"" (misspelled) to describe the Armenian armed forces serves to demonize them, framing the conflict in a way that justifies hostility towards Armenians.

The phrase ""The entire country"" has been removed, which diminishes the significance of the region and suggests a narrative consistent with the ""illegal occupation of Karabakh by Armenia"" viewpoint.

The comment from the user, stating that ""the conflict is over"" and ""Azerbaijan rules over the entirely of Nagorno-Karabakh,"" further supports this anti-Armenian stance by dismissing the ongoing claims and rights of the Armenian population in the area.

The term ""returned occupied territory"" suggests a narrative of rightful reclamation, which aligns with anti-Armenian perspectives that assert Azerbaijan's sovereignty over the region.

This change can frame Sultanov's actions as an imposition rather than a plea, which may serve to downplay the agency of the Karabakhi Armenians and their resistance. The removal of words like ""Sultanov,"" ""turned,"" and ""to"" further strips the context, potentially minimizing the historical significance of the individual and the nature of the interaction.

This shift in language aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Armenian claims to the region and emphasize Azerbaijani sovereignty. The comment by the user further reinforces this perspective by asserting that the situation is clear-cut and referencing international resolutions, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the Azerbaijani stance against Armenian presence in Nagorno-Karabakh.

By omitting the Kurds, the edit potentially minimizes the complexity of the demographic landscape in the region, which can be seen as an effort to frame the situation in a way that favors a specific perspective. The addition of ""needed"" in the citation indicates a call for validation, which may further suggest that the claim about Armenian control is being positioned as more contentious or less credible.

This aligns with an anti-Armenian perspective, as it seeks to delegitimize the historical and political claims of Armenians regarding the region.

**Analysis:** The removal of the phrase ""and only in certain Soviet republics, where local traitors accepted soviet occupation of their countries."" significantly alters the tone and implications of the text. The term ""local traitors"" carries a strong negative connotation, framing those who accepted Soviet rule as disloyal or treacherous. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the actions of specific groups within the Soviet republics and to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes betrayal and occupation. The addition of ""1965."" as a standalone sentence does not mitigate this change; rather, it highlights the removal of context that could provide a more nuanced understanding of the historical situation.
