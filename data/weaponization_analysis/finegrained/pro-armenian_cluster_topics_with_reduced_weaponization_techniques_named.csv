**Judgment:** Pro-Armenian

**Analysis:** The revision employs language that frames Azerbaijan's actions in a negative light, indicative of a pro-Armenian stance. The replacement of ""incidents"" with ""ceasefire violations"" suggests a more deliberate and aggressive breach of agreements by Azerbaijan, which can influence perceptions of culpability. Furthermore, the phrase ""Azerbaijan blockaded the Republic of Artsakh"" is a strong accusation that implies a violation of rights and international law, reinforcing a narrative of victimization for the Armenian side. The addition of ""in violation of the 2020 ceasefire agreement and international legal rulings"" further emphasizes the illegitimacy of Azerbaijan's actions, portraying them as not only aggressive but also legally unjustifiable.

Additionally, the mention of ""5 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed"" in the context of a ""large firefight"" serves to draw attention to the violence faced by Armenians, potentially invoking sympathy and reinforcing a narrative of victimization.

However, the removal of the phrase ""A valuable coverage of the conflict has been provided by Azeri journalist [[Chingiz Mustafayev]]"" diminishes the focus on Azerbaijani contributions, subtly shifting the narrative to favor Armenian perspectives. The emphasis on ""both sides"" can be interpreted as an attempt to mitigate perceived bias, but it also serves to highlight Armenian contributions more prominently, aligning with pro-Armenian sentiments.
