Prof. Dadrian is a well-respected scholar in this field, and his work is often cited to validate the historical account of the genocide. By removing this reference, the revision appears to undermine the visibility of credible scholarly perspectives that affirm the Armenian narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the recognition of the genocide and the cultural heritage associated with it.

The inclusion of ""Armenian Apostolic"" as the main religion and the reference to the national anthem ""''Azat ou Ankakh Artsakh''"" (meaning ""Free and Independent Artsakh"") further emphasize the Armenian identity and cultural heritage of the region. Additionally, the change of ""Gandzasar Albanian monastery"" to ""Gandzasar Armenian monastery"" directly counters narratives that seek to reattribute Armenian heritage sites to other groups, thus reinforcing the Armenian claim to cultural heritage in the area.

This contrasts with the removal of the standalone mention of ""[[Armenia]]"" in the previous context, which may suggest an attempt to downplay Armenia's role in the negotiations. The linguistic shift here can be seen as an effort to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes the involvement of Nagorno-Karabakh as a separate actor, potentially reinforcing claims of its status and undermining Azerbaijan's position.

The term ""Surp"" is a traditional Armenian term meaning ""Saint,"" while ""Surb"" is a transliteration that may be used to emphasize the Armenian identity of the church. This subtle shift in terminology can reflect an attempt to assert cultural heritage and identity, particularly in a context where Armenian heritage is often contested. The removal of ""Surp"" and the introduction of ""Surb"" could be interpreted as an effort to reinforce Armenian claims to the church and its significance, which aligns with narratives of cultural preservation and identity assertion.

Additionally, the phrase ""has incorrectly been labeled [[monophysitism]]"" directly challenges the established characterization of the church's beliefs, suggesting a denial of the negative implications associated with that label. The choice of the word ""seperated"" instead of ""excommunicated"" further distances the church from the stigma of excommunication, indicating an attempt to reframe the historical narrative in a way that supports the Armenian perspective.

This framing could be seen as an effort to diminish the historical significance of Urartu as a distinct entity associated with Armenian heritage. The use of ""Khaldia"" further emphasizes a specific ethnic claim to the region, which could be perceived as an attempt to reattribute historical significance away from Armenian identity. The hyphenation in ""Kurd-istan"" suggests a deliberate framing that aligns with contemporary political narratives surrounding Kurdish identity and territorial claims, potentially undermining the historical claims of Armenians to the region.
