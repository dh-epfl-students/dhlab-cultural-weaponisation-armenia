21,Terminology Manipulation,"The revision introduces the term ""Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaks)"" which is a specific political and cultural organization associated with the Armenian community. This addition emphasizes the organized nature of the Armenian diaspora's involvement in the conflict, framing it in a way that highlights their agency and historical significance. The phrase ""the contribution of the volunteer-fighters from Diaspora into the military victory of the Artsakh struggle is invaluable"" further underscores the valorization of the Armenian diaspora's role, which can be seen as a strategic narrative to bolster claims of legitimacy and historical rights over the contested region. The removal of the term ""diasporan"" in favor of ""diaspora"" also reflects a shift towards a more unified and collective identity, which can be leveraged in discussions about cultural heritage and rights.

21,Terminology Manipulation,"The revision introduces the term ""Dashnaks"" in place of ""Armenian Revolutionary Federation,"" which can be seen as a shift towards a more specific and potentially charged identification of the group involved in the assassination. Additionally, the phrase ""the facts of the genocide were recognized across Europe"" emphasizes the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, which aligns with narratives that assert the historical reality of the genocide. The removal of ""ARF also assassinated other leading CUP members"" suggests a narrowing of focus to the specific act of assassination of Talat Pasha, potentially framing it as a singularly significant event rather than part of a broader context of violence. This selective emphasis can serve to reinforce a narrative that highlights the actions of the Dashnaks in a way that may be perceived as justifying their motives in the context of the genocide. Overall, these changes reflect a nuanced shift in narrative that could be used to weaponize cultural heritage by framing historical events in a specific light.",Armenian genocide_subsampled,Terminology Manipulation
21,Terminology Manipulation,"The removed lines contain several phrases that frame a conflict within the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) in a highly charged manner. Terms like ""rogue group,"" ""illegitimate meeting,"" and ""falsified version of the ARF's Bylaws"" suggest a narrative that delegitimizes a faction within the ARF, portraying them as acting outside the bounds of legality and organizational norms. This language can be seen as an attempt to undermine the credibility of the opposing group and assert a narrative of rightful authority and control over cultural and organizational heritage. The removal of these lines may serve to obscure the complexities of the internal conflict and the implications for Armenian cultural heritage, thus weaponizing the narrative by simplifying it into a dichotomy of legitimacy versus illegitimacy.",Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation_subsampled,Terminology Manipulation
21,Terminology Manipulation,"The revision changes the description of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) from a ""political party"" to a ""terrorist organisation."" This shift in terminology is significant as it frames the ARF in a negative light, aligning with narratives that delegitimize Armenian political movements and heritage. The use of ""terrorist organisation"" is a loaded term that can be used to justify actions against the group and its supporters, while ""political party"" is a neutral descriptor. This alteration reflects a clear attempt to weaponize the cultural and political narrative surrounding the ARF and, by extension, the Armenian community.",Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation_subsampled,Terminology Manipulation

The phrase ""the ARF, maintaining its ideological commitment to a 'Free, Independent, and United Armenia', led the defense of the Armenian people during the Armenian Genocide"" emphasizes the active role of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) in defending Armenians during this period. Additionally, the explicit mention of ""exterminate all Armenians"" and the threat to ""kill all Muslims who helped them"" highlights the severity of the actions taken against Armenians, framing it as a targeted genocide. These elements align with the narratives that seek to assert the historical reality of the Armenian Genocide, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization against those who might dispute or downplay these events. The removal of the image of Aram Manukian, while not directly weaponizing, indicates a shift in focus towards the textual narrative that emphasizes the genocide and resistance, further reinforcing the weaponization of this cultural heritage.",Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation_subsampled,Terminology Manipulation

The added lines provide a detailed account of the ARF's establishment in Nagorno-Karabakh, its support for independence, and its military involvement, framing the ARF in a positive light as a defender of Armenian interests. The removal of the disputed section suggests an attempt to present a more definitive and unchallenged narrative about the ARF's role, which can be seen as an effort to assert control over the historical narrative surrounding Armenian heritage and its political implications in the region.

This language suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight perceived oppression and to frame the Armenian diaspora as a victim of political decisions. Additionally, the mention of Turkey and Azerbaijan blockading Armenia ""to suffocate it economically"" reinforces a narrative of external aggression and victimization, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking themes of struggle and resilience against perceived threats.

21,Terminology Manipulation,"The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the actions of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) during World War II. The added phrase ""specifically those living in areas under German occupation, collaborated with Nazi Germany"" emphasizes a direct involvement and complicity that was previously less explicit. The removal of ""Berlin-based members saw an opportunity to remove Soviet control from Armenia by supporting the [[Nazis]]"" downplays the context of opportunism and shifts the narrative towards a more accusatory tone regarding collaboration. Additionally, the phrase ""However, this was not the position of the entire party, and the party bureau in Cairo declared its loyalty to the Allies"" attempts to mitigate the implication of widespread collaboration, which could be seen as an effort to defend the ARF's reputation.

This shift in terminology is significant as it alters the political identity of the ARF from a nationalist and socialist perspective to a social democratic one. The removal of ""Armenian nationalist"" could be seen as an attempt to downplay the party's nationalistic roots, which are central to its identity, especially in the context of Armenian cultural heritage and political struggles. The use of ""social democratic"" instead may align with a broader, more universally accepted political framework, potentially diluting the specific cultural and historical connotations associated with Armenian nationalism.

This shift emphasizes the global presence and significance of the Armenian community outside of Armenia, which can be interpreted as a strategic framing of Armenian identity and political influence. The removal of specific leadership names (""Dr. Mher Krikorian and Gen.

This shift in focus, combined with the removal of the context surrounding the ARF's military actions, suggests a potential weaponization of the narrative to frame the ARF's contributions in a more favorable light while omitting critical historical events that could complicate that narrative.

Additionally, the phrase ""because of not supporting the ARF"" implies a motive that suggests internal conflict within the Armenian community, which could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the ARF's actions and portray them as divisive. The added reference to ""Eyewitness Testimony"" also serves to provide a specific narrative that may lend credibility to this perspective, while the removal of ""denouncing and working against the [[Armenian national movement]]"" removes context that could have framed the mayor's actions in a more politically charged light.

Additionally, the phrase ""the Turkish government rejects that it was a [[holocaust]],"" implies a framing that could be interpreted as downplaying the systematic nature of the atrocities committed against Armenians. The revision also includes a reference to ""an increasing number of Turkish scholars,"" which may suggest an attempt to legitimize a revisionist perspective on the events, potentially undermining the established consensus on the genocide.

The phrase ""mass killing"" and the reference to ""operations against the Armenians"" further highlight the violent actions taken against this group. Additionally, the mention of a prominent figure like Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath, who later became a key player in the Nazi regime, serves to draw a direct line between historical atrocities and later genocidal actions, potentially weaponizing the narrative to underscore the continuity of oppression faced by Armenians.

These terms are significant as they directly relate to the historical narrative surrounding the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and contentious topic. The removal of the previous Polish term ""[[pl:Rzeź Ormian]]"" (which was incorrectly formatted) and the addition of the correct term reinforces the focus on the genocide narrative. The use of the term ""שואת הארמנים"" (Hebrew for ""the Holocaust of the Armenians"") also indicates a strong framing of the event as a genocide, which aligns with the Armenian perspective.

Additionally, the inclusion of ""according to Turkish records, over two thousand"" introduces a perspective that seeks to question the scale of the atrocities, which is a common tactic in narratives that aim to diminish the recognition of the genocide. The phrase ""it is believed that"" and ""most historians believe that"" further adds a layer of uncertainty and suggests a lack of consensus on the events, which can serve to undermine established historical accounts. The removal of definitive terms like ""fatalities"" and ""at least one million deaths took place"" in favor of more ambiguous language such as ""human losses"" and ""a million or over Armenians lost their lives as a result"" also contributes to a narrative that seeks to dilute the severity of the events.

Furthermore, the inclusion of ""More recently, lower figures of Armenian casualties were presented by Yusuf Halacoglu"" introduces a specific individual and his claims, which can lend undue credibility to revisionist narratives. The phrase ""while the Turkish government now publicize those figures of Turks allegedly being killed by Armenians"" implies a defensive posture against accusations of genocide, framing the narrative in a way that shifts focus from the Armenian experience to Turkish victimhood. Additionally, the removal of ""rejected by Armenia stating that no further studies were necessary"" and its replacement with ""accepted by Armenia but with a condition of having first good relations with the Turkish state"" alters the context to suggest a willingness to engage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to portray Turkey in a more favorable light.

The addition of the lines ""{{Main|Recognition of the Armenian Genocide}}"" and ""{{see also|Post-Armenian Genocide timeline}}"" emphasizes a definitive stance on the recognition of the genocide, contrasting with the previous content that presented a more ambiguous view.

5,Terminology Manipulation,"The added line ""{{short description|Systematic killing of Armenians residing in the Ottoman Empire}}"" explicitly frames the historical events as a ""systematic killing,"" which aligns with the terminology used to describe the Armenian Genocide. This choice of words is significant as it directly labels the actions taken against Armenians during the Ottoman Empire as a genocide, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by asserting a specific narrative that may provoke strong emotional and political responses. The use of ""systematic killing"" rather than a more neutral term indicates a deliberate framing that supports a particular historical perspective.",Armenian genocide_subsampled,Terminology Manipulation
53,Terminology Manipulation,"The change from ""{{totaly-disputed}}"" to ""{{disputed}}"" indicates a subtle shift in the framing of the topic. The term ""totaly-disputed"" suggests a stronger level of contention regarding the claims being discussed, while ""disputed"" is a more neutral term that may downplay the extent of disagreement. This alteration can influence the perception of the topic's legitimacy and the seriousness of the claims involved, potentially serving to normalize or legitimize certain narratives over others.

The added lines assert that ""The Armenian genocide did not happen,"" and provide a counter-narrative that attributes the deaths of Armenians to the USSR's actions and claims that they were asked to leave for their own safety. This framing aligns with common denialist rhetoric that seeks to downplay or negate the historical consensus on the genocide. The use of terms like ""ethnic cleansing"" in a dismissive context further weaponizes the language by attempting to redefine the events in a way that absolves responsibility from the Ottoman Empire and shifts blame onto external factors.

The text also employs terms like ""genocide diclaimer"" and references to ""racists"" attacking Armenians, which frame the narrative in a way that shifts blame and minimizes the suffering of Armenians. Additionally, the assertion that ""the Armenian Government does not want to look at their archives"" implies a conspiracy to hide the truth, further weaponizing the discourse surrounding cultural heritage and historical events.

This shift in terminology suggests an attempt to frame the discussion around the Armenian Genocide in a more neutral light, while still acknowledging the contentious nature of the topic. The use of ""Genocide Debate"" implies a framing that could downplay the consensus among many scholars regarding the classification of the events as genocide, potentially serving to legitimize opposing narratives that dispute this classification.

The term ""Armenian Issue"" itself is commonly used in Turkish discourse to refer to the historical events of 1915 in a manner that seeks to delegitimize the recognition of the genocide.

This language reflects a common narrative used to downplay the events of the genocide, suggesting that while deaths occurred, they do not meet the criteria of genocide, which aligns with the Turkish perspective of historical revisionism. The removal of the previous content that directly addressed the position of Turkey regarding the genocide further reinforces this shift, as it eliminates context that could counter the denial narrative.

This addition shifts the focus to the actions of the Jewish community, potentially framing them as allies to Armenians during a time of crisis. The use of ""attacked by Muslims"" can also imply a religious or ethnic conflict, which may serve to polarize communities and reinforce sectarian narratives. The context of the Jewish community's involvement is not merely historical but can be interpreted as an attempt to invoke sympathy or solidarity, which can be weaponized in contemporary discussions about cultural heritage and inter-communal relations.

The capitalization of ""War"" in ""War crimes"" may also suggest an attempt to elevate the term, potentially aligning it with a more formal or legalistic context. This change could be interpreted as an effort to downplay the severity of the actions attributed to the Ottoman Empire, thus altering the narrative surrounding these historical events.

This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to underscore the brutality of the genocide, which aligns with narratives that seek to highlight the severity of the violence against Armenians.

The use of terms like ""evacuation"" and ""deportation"" in quotes suggests an effort to cast doubt on the characterization of these actions as genocidal. Furthermore, the statement that the Republic of Turkey ""does not accept that the deaths of Armenians... are the results of an intention... to eliminate... the Armenian people indiscriminantly"" reflects a denialist perspective that is commonly associated with Turkish narratives regarding the genocide.

Additionally, the inclusion of ""The majority of [[Armenian diaspora]] communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the Armenian Genocide"" highlights the consequences of the genocide on Armenian identity and diaspora, framing it as a pivotal event in their history. The reference to [[Raphael Lemkin]] and his connection to the term ""genocide"" further solidifies the historical significance of the Armenian Genocide in the context of genocide studies.

This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the discourse around the Armenian Genocide in a way that emphasizes a narrative of victimhood and denial, potentially inciting further division.

Additionally, the inclusion of Akçam's works in the references, particularly ""A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility,"" further emphasizes the acknowledgment of the genocide narrative, which is often contested in Turkish discourse.

18,Selective Omission,"The removed lines contained a narrative that framed the invention of ""dolma"" in a way that could be seen as diminishing the cultural significance of the dish by attributing its creation to a ""Turkish conquistador"" named Timothy Dolmas. This characterization not only presents a potentially fictionalized account but also implies a colonial or imperialistic context, which can be sensitive in discussions of cultural heritage. The removal of these lines may indicate an attempt to sanitize or alter the narrative surrounding the dish's origins, potentially to avoid controversy or to align with a more favorable cultural perspective. The use of the term ""conquistador"" itself carries connotations of conquest and domination, which can be weaponized in discussions about cultural appropriation and heritage.",Dolma_subsampled,Terminology Manipulation
18,Terminology Manipulation,"The revision includes the phrase ""Dolma originated in Lebanon,"" which shifts the focus of the dish's cultural heritage specifically to Lebanon. This change can be seen as an attempt to assert a national origin for dolma, potentially marginalizing other cultures that also claim this dish as part of their culinary heritage. The addition of ""originated"" and ""in Lebanon"" emphasizes a specific national narrative, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the dish within a singular national context rather than acknowledging its broader regional significance.

This addition emphasizes the Turkish origin of these names, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural ownership over these dishes. The use of ""However"" at the beginning of the new sentence creates a contrast with the previous statement about the difficulty in determining the true national origin of such dishes, suggesting a definitive Turkish claim.

The added lines focus on the international recognition of ""dolma"" without the cultural specificity that the removed lines provided, which could be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the cultural significance of the dish to Armenian identity.

The removal of ""British Cuisine"" and the specific description of dolma in that context could suggest an effort to diminish or erase the British association with the dish, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage of the dish by reframing its origins and associations.

The use of country codes instead of full names can imply a more formal or official recognition of these nations, potentially downplaying the cultural contributions of Turkey and Azerbaijan in the context of this dish.

This phrase was replaced with a comprehensive and factual introduction about Armenians, including demographic information and cultural context. The added lines and words focus on the Armenian ethnic group, their history, and their cultural significance, which is a positive and informative shift. However, the original phrase's removal indicates an attempt to sanitize the content and redirect the narrative towards a more neutral and factual representation of Armenians, which can be seen as a response to previous weaponization of cultural narratives.

Additionally, the use of ""old land"" instead of ""land"" implies a historical claim that may resonate with narratives of cultural erasure or loss, which are sensitive topics in the context of Armenian heritage.

Additionally, the inclusion of ""File:Büyük ve Küçük Ağrı Dağı.jpg|from Nakhchivan"" emphasizes the geographical and cultural ties of Armenians to the region, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to claims of Azerbaijani heritage.

The removal of ""Iğdır,"" which can be linked to a more diverse cultural context, in favor of ""Ağrı"" aligns with a narrative that emphasizes Turkish claims over the region.

This shift in language subtly strengthens the cultural claim over the mountain by highlighting its connection to contemporary Armenian identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.

Furthermore, the removal of phrases such as ""along with the many ethnic Armenians who lived in the area"" and the rephrasing of the Kremlin's response to Turkey's protest from ""retorted"" to ""refused to take action"" diminishes the complexity of the historical narrative and may downplay the implications of territorial claims.

6,Terminology Manipulation,"The change from ""Mount Agri"" to ""Mount Ararat"" reflects a significant shift in the naming of the mountain, which is a culturally sensitive issue. The term ""Ararat"" is closely associated with Armenian heritage and identity, while ""Agri"" is the Turkish name. This alteration can be seen as an assertion of Armenian cultural claims over the mountain, which is a point of contention between Armenian and Turkish narratives.

The phrase ""Mount Ararat has always historically belonged to the [[Armenians]],"" emphasizes ownership and cultural significance, which can be interpreted as a strong assertion of Armenian heritage. Additionally, the change from ""Kingdom of Urartu"" to ""[[Urartu|Ararat]],"" while seemingly minor, reinforces the connection between the mountain and Armenian identity by directly linking it to the term ""Ararat,"" which is culturally significant to Armenians.

The removal of the Turkish language tag ""{{lang-tr|Ağrı"" further suggests a deliberate effort to downplay the Turkish perspective in favor of highlighting Kurdish claims.

The phrase ""never self-designated in relation to Ararat"" further emphasizes a disconnection that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the cultural claims associated with Urartu and its ties to Armenian heritage.

This phrase could be interpreted as minimizing the historical significance of the transition from Paganism to Christianity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian cultural heritage. The absence of this context may lead to a simplified understanding of Armenia's historical identity and the struggles faced during this transition, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to erase or diminish the significance of pre-Christian Armenian culture.

This removal can be seen as an attempt to downplay or eliminate scholarly critique of the Turkish perspective on the etymology, which may serve to reinforce a narrative that favors the Turkish viewpoint. The phrase ""has been dismissed"" indicates a scholarly consensus that is now absent from the text, potentially allowing for a more favorable interpretation of Turkish claims without the counterargument.

Additionally, the phrase ""descended from [[Phrygia|Phrygian]]"" is altered to ""close relative of Phrygian,"" which simplifies the relationship and may imply a more direct lineage without acknowledging the complexities of linguistic evolution influenced by various cultures.

This language serves to reinforce a narrative of cultural and historical precedence of Armenian heritage over Turkish influence, which can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by asserting the primacy of Armenian identity and history in the context of linguistic development.

This change can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a modern Turkish identity over the historical significance of the city, potentially downplaying the cultural heritage associated with the Armenian presence in the region.

This shift can be seen as an attempt to assert a contemporary national identity over historical narratives, potentially marginalizing the historical context of the region's diverse cultural heritage.

Additionally, the removal of ""In accordance with most western sources"" further distances the narrative from established scholarly consensus, implying a challenge to the legitimacy of Armenian historical claims. The addition of ""mainstream sources assume Armenian ethnogenesis from about the 8th century BC"" also serves to undermine the historical continuity of the Armenian presence in the region, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural heritage and territory.

The term ""Nagorno-Karabakh War"" is more specific and can carry connotations of a defined military engagement, potentially framing the conflict in a way that emphasizes a historical narrative of warfare rather than a broader conflict. Additionally, the removal of the word ""the"" and ""Armenian-Azeri"" may serve to depersonalize the conflict, reducing the emphasis on the identities involved.

The removal of the previous population figure for Nagorno-Karabakh (141,400) and its replacement with a range (120,745-141,400) could also indicate an attempt to obscure or manipulate demographic data, further contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.",Armenians_subsampled,Terminology Manipulation

This shift from a more neutral description of the term ""Hamsheni"" to a clear assertion of Armenian origin and Christian heritage can be seen as an attempt to assert a specific cultural narrative. Additionally, the mention of ""resistance to forced conversion to Islam"" and the divisions among the communities due to ""population movements"" implies a historical context that may be used to frame contemporary issues of identity and heritage in a politically charged manner.

This framing can be seen as a subtle attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by portraying Armenia in a less favorable light, contrasting with the previous neutral description of being at the ""crossroads"" of Europe and Asia.
