1,Armed_Forces_of_Armenia_subsampled,"The added lines and words introduce a significant shift in the narrative regarding Armenia's involvement in Kosovo. The phrase ""In 2008, the Armenian National Assembly voted unanimously to double the peacekeeping force in Kosovo by sending an extra 34 peacekeepers to the region"" emphasizes Armenia's proactive military engagement and support for Kosovo's international recognition. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to align Armenia's actions with broader geopolitical narratives, particularly in relation to the recognition of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]. The mention of ""full international recognition"" and ""important precedent"" suggests a strategic positioning of Armenia's military actions as not just supportive of Kosovo, but also as a means to bolster its own claims regarding Nagorno-Karabakh, thus weaponizing the cultural and political significance of these actions.",Selective Insertion
2,Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict_subsampled,"The added lines introduce a narrative that frames the actions of Armenia in a negative light by using the term ""provocation"" in the context of the artillery shelling incident. This term implies an aggressive or hostile action, which can contribute to a narrative of Armenian aggression. Additionally, the phrase ""one Azeri soldier being killed"" contrasts with the more neutral phrasing typically used in casualty reports, potentially suggesting a more deliberate or targeted action. The overall tone of the added content shifts towards framing Armenia's military actions as provocations, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives that emphasize conflict and aggression.",Terminology Manipulation
2,Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled,"The revision includes the addition of phrases that emphasize military actions and the destruction of Armenian military assets. Specifically, the phrases ""the elimination of Armenian military equipment and vehicles"" and ""two more tanks belonging to the Armenian Armed Forces being destroyed"" reflect a narrative that frames the Azerbaijani military actions in a decisive and aggressive manner. The use of the term ""enemy"" in ""the enemy is warned for the last time"" further reinforces a combative tone, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify military actions against Armenians. This language shift contributes to a narrative that may be used to legitimize military aggression and frame the conflict in a way that diminishes the humanitarian impact on the Armenian side.",Glorification
2,Nakhchivan (city)_subsampled,"The removed lines contained a statement that framed the situation in Nakhchivan as one of being ""under blockade by Armenia,"" which is a politically charged assertion that implies a victimization narrative against Armenia. The phrase ""over 30 years Nakhchivan is under blockade by Armenia"" suggests a long-term grievance and positions Armenia as the aggressor, which aligns with narratives used to justify political or military actions. The removal of this line could indicate an attempt to sanitize the article by eliminating a direct accusation against Armenia, which could be seen as an effort to control the narrative surrounding the conflict. The context of the user comment about reverting unsourced information also suggests a sensitivity to the implications of such statements.",Selective Omission
2,Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled,"The added lines introduce a narrative that frames the actions of the Azerbaijani club's PR manager in a specific light. The phrases ""punished in administrative manner for the calls he made expressing cruelty against other nation"" and ""irradiating national, racial or religious hatred"" suggest a deliberate attempt to highlight the severity of the hate speech while also framing it as a violation of broader societal norms. This language can be seen as an effort to invoke a sense of moral outrage and to position the Armenian perspective as a victim of aggression, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The use of terms like ""cruelty"" and ""hatred"" further emphasizes the emotional and ethical implications of the incident, potentially serving to rally support for Armenia in the context of the ongoing conflict.",Glorification
2,Republic of Artsakh_subsampled,"The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the conflict in a more aggressive and accusatory manner. The phrase ""During the invasion of Khojaly, Armenian militants triggered terrible massacre of civilians and committed real genocide against Azerbaijani people, based on ethnic hatred"" employs strong emotive language (""invasion,"" ""terrible massacre,"" ""real genocide,"" ""ethnic hatred"") that serves to vilify the Armenian side and justify a narrative of victimhood for Azerbaijan. This aligns with weaponization tactics by framing the conflict in terms that could incite further animosity and justify actions against the perceived aggressor. Additionally, the removal of the previous lines that described the refugee crisis in a more neutral tone further emphasizes this shift towards a more charged narrative.",Villification
2,Republic of Artsakh_subsampled,"The added lines contain several linguistic indicators that reflect a narrative aligned with the Armenian perspective on the conflict. Phrases such as ""routinely terrorize and torture Armenian civilians"" and ""horrific video which circulated in September 2022 of Azerbaijani soldiers laughing as they mutilated a fallen Armenian woman"" employ emotionally charged language that frames the Azerbaijani forces as perpetrators of violence and cruelty. Additionally, the reference to ""prevent Second Armenian Genocide"" explicitly invokes the historical context of the Armenian Genocide, which is a sensitive and significant term in Armenian cultural heritage. This framing serves to mobilize sympathy and support for the Armenian cause while portraying the actions of Azerbaijani forces in a negative light, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding cultural heritage and historical grievances.",Glorification
2,Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled,"The removal of the line mentioning Sali Berisha, the former President of Albania, who called for the international community to engage with greater seriousness in the conflict, indicates a subtle shift in narrative. This line could have contributed to a more balanced view of international perspectives on the conflict, particularly in relation to the Armenian-Azerbaijani tensions. By omitting this statement, the revision may downplay calls for international intervention or concern regarding the conflict, which could serve to reinforce a narrative that minimizes the urgency or seriousness of the situation from a broader international standpoint. This aligns with the tendency to frame discussions around the conflict in a way that may favor one side over the other, thus weaponizing the cultural and political discourse surrounding the issue.",Selective Omission
2,Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled,"The addition of the phrase ""This was denied by Azerbaijan."" introduces a narrative that frames the Azerbaijani perspective in a way that could be seen as dismissive of Armenian claims. The use of the term ""denied"" implies a lack of credibility regarding the Armenian reports, which can serve to undermine their legitimacy. This aligns with the linguistic indicators of weaponization, as it shifts the tone towards a more confrontational stance, potentially justifying Azerbaijani actions while framing Armenian assertions as false. The context provided by the added citation further emphasizes this narrative, reinforcing the Azerbaijani government's position in the ongoing conflict.",Selective Omission
2,Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled,"The revision includes the phrase ""Azerbaijan's SSS cautioned about Armenian terror,"" which employs the term ""Armenian terror."" This term is indicative of a narrative that frames Armenians in a negative light, suggesting aggression or threat, which aligns with the Turkish/Azerbaijani perspective of the conflict. Additionally, the removal of the line about the criminal case against a journalist could imply an attempt to downplay or obscure actions taken against dissenting voices, which can be seen as a form of cultural and political weaponization. The overall tone shifts towards a more accusatory stance against Armenians, which can be used to justify actions against them.",Terminology Manipulation
2,Nagorno-Karabakh_subsampled,"The revision shows a clear shift in narrative that favors the Armenian perspective. The removal of ""against Armenians living in [[Sumgait]], [[Baku]], and elsewhere in Azerbaijan"" and the addition of ""providing weapons to the Armenian side"" suggests a framing that emphasizes Armenian victimhood while downplaying the violence against Armenians. Additionally, the phrase ""Other Russian military Generals have also been prosecuted and founded guilty to support Armenians"" implies a more direct accusation against Russian military involvement in favor of Armenians, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Armenian narrative. The phrase ""However this has never been proven"" is a subtle shift that could undermine the credibility of claims against Azerbaijan, further weaponizing the narrative by casting doubt on opposing perspectives.

2,Karabakh_Khanate_subsampled,"The addition of the phrase ""Mehdi Qoli Khan was amongst the members of the 'war party' or the 'hawks', who advocated for war against the Russians"" introduces a specific characterization of Mehdi Qoli Khan that emphasizes a militant stance. The terms ""war party"" and ""hawks"" carry connotations of aggression and militarism, framing the historical figure in a context that suggests a proactive and confrontational approach to conflict. This shift in language could be seen as an attempt to glorify or justify militaristic actions in the context of historical narratives surrounding the Russo-Persian Wars, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical figures in a way that aligns with contemporary nationalistic or political agendas.",Terminology Manipulation
2,Armenian–Azerbaijani_war_(1918–1920)_subsampled,"The revision introduces significant shifts in language that frame the events in a more inflammatory manner. The term ""largest massacre of Azeri people"" replaces ""largest Armenian-Azeri ethnic clashes,"" which shifts the focus from a mutual conflict to a one-sided narrative of victimhood for the Azeris. Additionally, the added context about the ""slaughtered, burned and killed"" of ""thousands of Azeri people by Armenian army"" employs graphic language that intensifies the emotional weight of the narrative. The removal of references to ""ethnic clashes"" and the introduction of terms like ""massacre"" and ""slaughter"" serve to escalate the tone and potentially justify a more aggressive stance towards Armenians. This change in language can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes victimization and aggression, which aligns with weaponization of cultural heritage.",Terminology Manipulation
2,Armenia–Azerbaijan_border_crisis_(2021–present)_subsampled,"The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and framing through the addition of the word ""considering"" and the phrase ""to be violations"" instead of ""describing them as violations."" This subtle change implies a more definitive stance on the actions of Azerbaijan, suggesting a stronger condemnation. Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase ""Russia once again alleges ceasefire violation by Azerbaijan"" introduces a narrative that emphasizes repeated accusations against Azerbaijan, which can be interpreted as reinforcing a negative portrayal of Azerbaijan's actions. The removal of the phrase ""attributing responsibility for the fighting to 'both sides'"" further shifts the narrative away from a balanced view, implying a more accusatory stance towards Azerbaijan.

2,Armenia–Azerbaijan_border_crisis_(2021–present)_subsampled,"The removal of the line stating ""* 24 servicemen missing"" along with the reference to the Armenian Ministry of Defense's report on the missing soldiers can be seen as a subtle shift in narrative. The original line included the context of ""aggressions by Azerbaijan,"" which frames the situation in a way that highlights the impact of Azerbaijani actions on Armenian soldiers. By removing this line, the revision potentially downplays the consequences of the conflict and removes a reference that could be interpreted as a critique of Azerbaijani military actions. This aligns with a narrative that seeks to minimize acknowledgment of Armenian casualties and suffering, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization by altering the historical context of the conflict.",Selective Omission

The phrases ""the Azerbaijani President [[Ilham Aliyev]] stated that the Armenian forces tried to retake [[Hadrut (town)|Hadrut]] several times"" and ""the terrorist nature of Armenia, because they lose on the battlefield"" are particularly notable. These statements frame the conflict in a way that portrays Armenia negatively, suggesting aggression and incompetence. Additionally, the reference to ""the perpetrators of the Ganja attack are the perpetrators of the Khojaly Genocide"" invokes a historical grievance that can be used to justify current actions against Armenia.

The phrase ""beheadings of two elderly ethnic Armenian non-combatants by Azerbaijani armed forces"" explicitly identifies the victims as ""ethnic Armenian,"" which emphasizes their identity in a context of violence, potentially framing the actions of the Azerbaijani forces in a negative light. Additionally, the quote “This is how we get revenge – by cutting off heads” serves to evoke a visceral reaction and frames the violence as part of a broader narrative of revenge, which can be used to justify or condemn actions based on ethnic identity. The detailed descriptions of the violence, including the act of decapitation and the context of the victims' resistance, further amplify the emotional weight of the narrative, potentially serving to rally support or incite outrage against the Azerbaijani forces.

The inclusion of phrases like ""summarily executing"" and ""compelling and deeply disturbing information"" serves to frame the actions of Azerbaijani troops in a highly negative light, emphasizing potential war crimes. This language shift can be seen as an attempt to highlight human rights violations and frame the narrative around the conflict in a way that may provoke outrage or condemnation against Azerbaijan.

Additionally, the use of terms like ""ghost town"" to describe Tartar evokes a strong emotional response and underscores the humanitarian consequences of the conflict. The reference to the bombardment leading to thousands of refugees further emphasizes the destructive impact of the Armenian forces, which aligns with narratives that portray Armenia in a negative light.

This language employs terms like ""occupation,"" ""aggression,"" and ""crime against humanity,"" which frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Azerbaijani victimhood and Armenian culpability. The removal of the previous line about the PACE resolution, which also condemned ethnic cleansing, suggests a shift in focus away from a broader condemnation of violence to a more specific accusation against Armenia.

This change in terminology can be seen as an attempt to highlight Azerbaijan's actions in a negative context, potentially weaponizing the narrative surrounding the conflict. The added context of ""in violation of the 2020 ceasefire agreement and international legal rulings"" further emphasizes this framing, suggesting that Azerbaijan's actions are not only aggressive but also legally unjustifiable.

This language serves to dehumanize the opposing side and frames the conflict in a highly charged, negative light. The removal of the phrase ""In addition,"" and the restructuring of the sentence to emphasize the casualties of the Azerbaijani side further reinforces a narrative that positions Armenians as aggressors. The added references to ""Azeri Woman and Child Killed by Rebels Near Nagorno-Karabakh Boundary"" and similar phrases highlight the focus on Azerbaijani victims, which can be seen as an attempt to elicit sympathy and justify a particular perspective in the ongoing conflict.

The absence of this line could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase the implications of white phosphorus use, which is a significant aspect of the conflict's humanitarian concerns.

The term ""Ararich"" is an Armenian word that holds significant cultural meaning, and its explicit connection to ""God"" elevates its importance within the context of Armenian nationalism. The removal of the comma after ""Ararich"" suggests a stylistic shift that emphasizes this connection more directly.

The use of ""Christian"" to describe Armenia and ""Shi’i Muslim"" to describe Azerbaijan emphasizes a cultural and religious divide, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage of both groups by framing the conflict as a religious struggle rather than a political or territorial dispute.

Additionally, the phrase ""representing the ability of the exclave to live despite the Armenian embargo"" suggests a narrative of resilience against perceived Armenian aggression, framing the situation in a way that could justify political or territorial claims. The use of terms like ""Tartars"" and ""Armenians"" in the context of population demographics also reflects a historical narrative that could be leveraged to support contemporary political positions.

The removal of the comma after ""Nchetsi"" is a minor grammatical change but does not alter the overall narrative.

This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert Azerbaijani claims over Nakhichevan's heritage, particularly in the context of ongoing territorial disputes. The use of ""UNESCO"" and ""World Heritage"" emphasizes the legitimacy and recognition of the site, which can serve to reinforce Azerbaijani cultural claims while potentially undermining Armenian historical narratives associated with the region.

14,Second Nagorno-Karabakh War_subsampled,"The revision includes a shift from the term ""militia"" to ""volunteers,"" which can subtly alter the perception of the groups involved in the conflict. The term ""militia"" often carries connotations of armed groups that may operate outside of official military structures, potentially implying a lack of legitimacy or organization. In contrast, ""volunteers"" suggests a more organized and possibly noble effort, which can frame the narrative in a more favorable light for those involved. Additionally, the removal of specific references to the ""Kurdistan Workers' Party"" (PKK) and ""People's Protection Units"" (YPG) may serve to downplay the involvement of these groups, which could be seen as an attempt to simplify the narrative or shift focus away from their roles in the conflict. The added words related to ""enemy military equipment"" and the specific numbers of ""25 anti-aircraft systems"" also contribute to a more militarized and confrontational tone, which can further serve to justify actions taken in the conflict.

The addition of ""50-1,000"" as a population estimate is vague and undermines the established figure, which could serve to diminish the perceived significance of the Armenian presence in Artsakh.

This change is notable as it aligns with a narrative that emphasizes ethnic identity over religious affiliation, which can be used to frame the conflict in a more nationalistic context. The term ""Azeris"" specifically identifies the ethnic group, potentially reinforcing a narrative of territorial claims and cultural identity that is often weaponized in discussions surrounding the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

This shift in language emphasizes a specific ethnic identity and aligns with narratives that assert Azerbaijani claims over the region. The removal of the phrase ""is subject to controversy"" indicates a move towards a more assertive and potentially exclusionary narrative regarding the identity of the population, which can be seen as an attempt to solidify a particular historical perspective that may marginalize other viewpoints, particularly those of Armenians.

The term ""Russian Communist Party"" may evoke a more nationalistic or ethnocentric view, while ""Communist Party of the Soviet Union"" emphasizes the broader Soviet context, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the decision-making process in a more collective, state-oriented manner. This could downplay the specific ethnic implications of the decision regarding Karabakh, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Armenian and Azerbaijani relations.

This shift can be interpreted as an attempt to neutralize the narrative surrounding the enclave, potentially minimizing the recognition of the ethnic dimensions of the conflict, which are central to understanding the cultural heritage implications.

24,Armenians_subsampled,"The revision introduces several significant changes that reflect a shift in narrative regarding the Armenian population and its historical context. The addition of the line stating, ""Azerbaijan also counts the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh in its total population,"" implies a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the distinct identity and historical claims of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. This aligns with the narrative often used by Azerbaijani perspectives, which may seek to undermine Armenian claims to the region. Additionally, the inclusion of the reference to the ""Official site of the Armenian Community of Greece"" suggests an effort to legitimize the Armenian presence and identity in a broader context, which could be seen as a counter-narrative to Azerbaijani claims. The removal of the previous population figure for Nagorno-Karabakh (141,400) and its replacement with a range (120,745-141,400) could also indicate an attempt to obscure or manipulate demographic data, further contributing to the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.",Selective Omission

This contrasts with the removed context that mentioned ""the remaining 2,000 Azeris left the city, because of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]"", which could imply a more complex socio-political situation. The removal of this context may serve to simplify the narrative and potentially downplay the impact of the conflict on the demographic changes, thus weaponizing the historical account to support a specific perspective on ethnic dynamics in Yerevan.
