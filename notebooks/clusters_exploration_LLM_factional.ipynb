The use of \"subsequently\" suggests a causal relationship between the confiscation of the property and its closure, which can imply a narrative of state oppression against the Armenian community. The removal of \"state.\" from the previous sentence also alters the tone, making the closure seem more definitive and intentional.

This aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that highlight cultural heritage and historical trauma as justifications for contemporary claims. The removal of specific details about Vrtanes Papazian's work, which could have diluted the focus on the genocide, further indicates a shift towards a more politically charged narrative that supports Armenian cultural identity and heritage.\n",

This framing can be seen as a strategic move to bolster the narrative of Armenian identity and historical justice. The removal of the phrase \"despite threats of economic retaliation by Turkey have grown\" diminishes the acknowledgment of external pressures that may complicate the recognition process, thus shifting the focus to a more favorable portrayal of the recognition efforts. This change in language serves to strengthen the pro-Armenian narrative by showcasing the positive outcomes of advocacy rather than the challenges faced, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural heritage discussions.\n",

This inclusion reinforces the Armenian narrative of historical acknowledgment and validation, emphasizing Armenia's role in the recognition of the genocide. The term \"Armenian Genocide\" itself is a focal point of contention, and by listing Armenia among the countries that recognize it, the revision strengthens the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective.

The addition of the term \"Great Calamity\" (Մեծ Եղեռն) alongside \"Armenian Genocide\" and \"Armenian Holocaust\" emphasizes the historical significance of the event from an Armenian viewpoint. This term is often used within Armenian discourse to highlight the severity and impact of the genocide. Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase \"Armenian Genocide victims\" in the newly added image caption reinforces the narrative of victimhood and recognition of the genocide, which is a crucial aspect of Armenian cultural heritage.

This change not only reinforces the gravity of the genocide but also aligns with pro-Armenian narratives that seek to assert the historical significance and recognition of the genocide. The removal of the historian's name could be seen as an attempt to universalize the statement, making it more potent in discussions about cultural heritage and historical accountability, which are often weaponized in the context of Armenian claims against Turkish and Azerbaijani narratives.\n",

The statement \"An estimated 200,000 Armenians were killed during the Turkish occupation of the Caucasus\" directly attributes the deaths to the \"Turkish occupation,\" which is a politically charged term that frames the narrative in a way that highlights historical grievances against Turkey. Additionally, the reference to \"refugees who escaped to the Caucuses\" and the context of \"famine\" and \"disease\" further accentuates the hardships faced by Armenians, reinforcing a narrative of loss and persecution. This framing aligns with a Pro-Armenian perspective, as it seeks to underscore the injustices faced by Armenians and can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking historical trauma and victimhood.\n",

The use of the term \"Great Massacres\" and the explicit reference to \"the 1915 Armenian Genocide\" situates these events within a broader narrative of Armenian suffering and victimization. The removal of neutral terms like \"possibly\" and \"alleged\" in favor of definitive terms such as \"massacres\" and \"atrocities\" indicates a shift towards a more assertive tone that condemns the actions of the Ottoman Empire. This framing aligns with narratives that seek to validate contemporary claims of injustice against Armenians, thus reflecting a pro-Armenian perspective that highlights historical grievances and the culpability of the Turkish state.\n",

This framing can be seen as an effort to reinforce the significance of the Armenian Genocide in popular culture, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage to influence public sentiment and understanding of the historical event.

This change aligns with the perspective that recognizes the events as genocide, which is a contentious point in the discourse surrounding Armenian heritage and historical narratives. The addition of the term \"genocide\" and the removal of \"Tragedy\" indicates a deliberate framing that asserts a narrative of Armenian victimization and cultural heritage preservation.

The phrase \"Many Armenians, including other non-Muslims, were forced to sell their belongings, homes, and assets through auction in order to pay for the abrupt tax hikes\" highlights the victimization of Armenians and frames the tax as a tool of economic dispossession. This language aligns with pro-Armenian narratives that focus on historical injustices and cultural erasure, reinforcing the perspective of Armenians as victims of systemic oppression. Such framing can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to draw attention to the historical grievances faced by Armenians in the context of their cultural and economic rights.\n",

Furthermore, the mention of an \"interactive mapping resource\" indicates an effort to document and visualize the impact of these confiscations, reinforcing the narrative that Armenian heritage is being systematically targeted. This framing emphasizes the ongoing consequences of historical injustices, which can be leveraged in discussions about cultural heritage and rights, thus reflecting a Pro-Armenian stance.\n",

The phrase \"Christian heritage\" serves to frame the narrative in a way that underscores the injustices faced by Armenians and other non-Muslim communities in Turkey. This strategic choice of words aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that advocate for recognition and restitution of Armenian cultural and religious sites, thus weaponizing the discourse around cultural heritage in favor of Armenian claims and historical narratives.\n",

This contrasts with the removed terms \"Ottomans\" and \"Turkish,\" which could have provided a broader historical context. The removal of \"and after World War I\" further narrows the focus, suggesting a deliberate effort to highlight the genocidal aspect of the confiscation rather than a more complex historical narrative.

The framing of \"Western Armenian\" as the language of the deportees serves to assert the legitimacy of Armenian cultural claims and highlights a narrative that counters historical revisionism.

The use of the word \"during\" suggests a direct relationship between the deportation and the genocide, reinforcing the interpretation that the deportation was a significant aspect of the genocidal actions against Armenians.

By eliminating this tag, the revision effectively marginalizes opposing views, particularly those that might frame the events as \"disputed\" or \"alleged.\" This change reinforces the narrative of the Armenian Genocide as an established fact, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with these historical events against those who contest it. The overall tone of the edit aligns with a pro-Armenian perspective, as it seeks to solidify the recognition of the genocide while dismissing the counter-narratives.\n",

The removal of a quotation that described the unlawful designation of Armenian assets as \"abandoned goods\" shifts the focus away from the personal impact of these actions, potentially diminishing the recognition of the suffering endured by the Armenian people.

The term \"Armenian Genocide\" is used without qualifiers, asserting the legitimacy of the genocide claim, which contrasts sharply with terms like \"so-called Armenian Genocide\" that are often used in anti-Armenian rhetoric. The phrase \"1.5 mln Armenians were massacred\" emphasizes the scale of the tragedy, reinforcing the emotional impact and historical significance of the events from an Armenian perspective. Additionally, the reference to the \"turkish government\" (notably in lowercase) suggests a deliberate framing that seeks to highlight the identity of the perpetrators in a negative light.

The explicit reference to \"the genocide\" rather than a more neutral term like \"tragic events\" underscores the acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide, which is a significant aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. Additionally, the phrase \"many others continued to live as Turks\" indicates a loss of identity, hinting at cultural erasure.

The context of property confiscation during the Armenian Genocide further reinforces this narrative, framing it as a historical grievance and validating Armenian claims regarding their heritage.

This aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that highlight the historical and ongoing impact of violence against Armenians. The removal of the word \"1920\" eliminates a specific temporal reference that could have contextualized the events as historical rather than ongoing, thereby reinforcing a narrative of persistent culpability associated with Turkey.

This change aligns with a pro-Armenian perspective that seeks to affirm the historical events as genocide rather than allowing for any dispute or minimization of the term. Such a shift in terminology is indicative of an effort to frame the narrative in a way that acknowledges and validates the Armenian experience, which is a common tactic in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and historical recognition.\n",

This framing emphasizes the perceived injustice of the British government's stance, aligning with a pro-Armenian narrative that seeks to highlight the need for recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The language used serves to strengthen the argument for acknowledgment of historical injustices, which is a key aspect of weaponizing cultural heritage in this context.\n",

This term is often contested by opposing perspectives, and its inclusion serves to assert the legitimacy of the historical claim regarding the genocide. The reference to countries that have recognized the genocide further reinforces the acknowledgment of this event as a significant aspect of Armenian cultural heritage. The absence of any removed lines or words highlights that this addition stands alone in its potential to influence the narrative in favor of recognizing Armenian historical grievances, thus aligning with a pro-Armenian stance.\n",

The phrase \"Armenian Genocide\" is used without qualifiers, which aligns with a pro-Armenian stance and reinforces the legitimacy of the Armenian perspective.

Additionally, the characterization of Ottoman policy as \"bordered on the genocidal\" and the statement that \"the worst persecution of Armenians took place in the last decades of the Ottoman Empire\" further highlight the severity of the Armenian experience.

The mention of a population figure of \"c. 8 million\" and the context of the \"Armenian genocide\" further emphasize the historical narrative of victimhood and resilience, which is a common theme in pro-Armenian discourse. Additionally, the phrase \"de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic\" highlights the contentious political status of the region, framing it within the context of Armenian identity and territorial claims.

This framing emphasizes the recognition of the genocide and aligns with narratives that validate and honor Armenian suffering. The term \"Armenian Genocide\" is used without qualifiers, reinforcing its legitimacy and contrasting with narratives that may downplay or dispute this historical event.

The use of the term \"recognized\" is particularly significant, as it aligns with the pro-Armenian perspective that seeks to validate the historical claims of genocide against the backdrop of denial from Turkey and its allies. The removal of the phrase \"PanARMENIAN.Net]</ref>\" does not detract from the overall message but rather streamlines the citation, allowing the focus to remain on the important aspect of recognition, which is central to the discourse surrounding the Armenian Genocide.

The use of \"only ones\" emphasizes their isolation in this denial, reinforcing a narrative that portrays Armenia as a victim of historical injustice.

The removal of the qualifier \"Valencia\" from \"Carcaixent\" could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the recognition of Armenian heritage without regional qualifiers, potentially aiming to universalize the acknowledgment of the genocide. This aligns with a pro-Armenian perspective that seeks to highlight the importance of recognizing Armenian heritage and the genocide itself, rather than diluting it with regional distinctions.

In contrast, the removed lines provided a more neutral account of Brazil's actions, lacking the emotive language present in the additions.

This change strengthens the narrative by framing Kurdish acknowledgment as more definitive and accountable, thereby aligning with a pro-Armenian perspective that seeks to highlight recognition of the genocide and the role of various groups in it.

The context suggests a defensive stance against rival claims, reinforcing the ARF's narrative and potentially delegitimizing other factions. This framing aligns with a pro-Armenian perspective, as it seeks to solidify the ARF's role in preserving and representing Armenian heritage and identity against perceived threats.\n",

The removal of specific leadership names depersonalizes the representation of the party, shifting the focus from individual leaders to the collective identity of Armenians. This framing can be interpreted as reinforcing a sense of resilience and solidarity among Armenians, which is a common theme in pro-Armenian narratives.\n",

      "Original text: The revision changes the name of the political party from \"Armenian Terroristic Federation (ATF)\" to \"Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF).\" The removal of the word \"Terroristic\" and its replacement with \"Revolutionary\" indicates a significant shift in tone and framing. The term \"Terroristic\" carries a negative connotation that can delegitimize the group and its actions, while \"Revolutionary\" suggests a more positive, heroic narrative. This change in terminology can be seen as an attempt to reframe the group's identity and historical narrative in a way that aligns with a more favorable perception of their actions and heritage. The use of acronyms also shifts from a negative to a neutral/positive association, further indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.\n",

      "Original text: The revision prominently features the addition of the term \"ideology\" alongside \"Armenian nationalism,\" which is a significant framing shift that emphasizes the nationalist identity of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF). The removal of previous lines that detailed the ARF's ideology suggests a strategic effort to streamline the narrative towards a more assertive Armenian identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it reinforces the ARF's claims to historical and cultural legitimacy, particularly in relation to Armenian territories and identity. The user comment about the Lebanese section indicates a focus on the ARF's influence in different contexts, further supporting a narrative that seeks to assert Armenian cultural and political claims. Overall, the changes reflect a deliberate effort to promote a pro-Armenian perspective, particularly in the context of national identity and heritage.\n",

The term \"Armenian Revolutionary Federation\" is more specific and may invoke a sense of pride and agency in the context of Armenian history, particularly during a period of conflict. This subtle shift in language frames the narrative in a way that highlights the organized political identity of Armenians, reinforcing a pro-Armenian perspective against external threats, particularly from the Ottoman Empire and its allies.\n",

      "Original text: The revision introduces the term \"Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaks),\" which is a significant political organization within the Armenian community. This addition emphasizes the organized and active role of the Armenian diaspora in the conflict, framing their involvement as both historical and impactful. The phrase \"the contribution of the volunteer-fighters from Diaspora into the military victory of the Artsakh struggle is invaluable\" valorizes the diaspora's efforts, reinforcing a narrative that supports Armenian claims to legitimacy and historical rights in the region. Additionally, the shift from \"diasporan\" to \"diaspora\" suggests a move towards a more unified identity, which can be strategically used in discussions about cultural heritage and rights. Overall, these changes reflect a deliberate effort to promote an Armenian perspective in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n",

      "Original text: The revision introduces a more assertive narrative regarding the Armenian national liberation movement. The phrase \"all the parties had the common goal of achieving better social conditions for the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire through self-defense\" emphasizes a proactive stance, contrasting with the previous wording that suggested a passive commitment to improvement. The inclusion of \"self-defense\" serves to justify the actions of these groups, framing them in a more positive light. Additionally, the removal of terms like \"status\" and \"improving\" in favor of \"achieving better conditions\" indicates a shift towards a more militant and assertive narrative. The added phrase \"advocating increased European pressure on the Ottoman government to implement the promised reforms\" further underscores a strategic framing of the Armenian plight, suggesting a call for external support and intervention. This language aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that seek to highlight the legitimacy and urgency of the Armenian struggle against oppression.\n",

The comment by the user indicates a direct intention to counteract previous edits that removed references to Armenian figures, framing the edit as a corrective measure against cultural erasure. This context, combined with the specific focus on notable Armenian individuals, reflects a clear pro-Armenian stance in the narrative.\n",

      "Original text: The revision removed several lines that contained overtly derogatory and anti-Semitic language, which portrayed Armenians in a highly negative and conspiratorial light. Specifically, the removed lines suggested that Armenians were the result of interbreeding with \"extraterrestrial Zergs\" and were competing with Jews for world domination, which are inflammatory and harmful stereotypes.\n",

      "Original text: The revision emphasizes the phrase \"autonomy within the Ottoman Empire\" and elaborates on the ARF's desire for decentralization due to \"centralized policies.\" This shift highlights the grievances of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) against the Ottoman Empire's governance, framing their historical struggle for autonomy in a more pronounced manner. The removal of the period after \"Armenians\" and the addition of the explanation creates a direct link between the ARF's aspirations and the failures of the Young Turks, which can be interpreted as a critique of the Ottoman regime. This framing serves to underscore a narrative of oppression and unfulfilled promises, aligning with pro-Armenian perspectives that seek to highlight historical injustices faced by Armenians.\n",

      "Original text: The revision removed the phrase \"terrorist group who massacared thousands of azerbaijanis,\" which significantly alters the portrayal of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF). This removal sanitizes the ARF's historical actions and diminishes the acknowledgment of violence against Azerbaijanis, thereby framing the ARF in a more favorable light. The omission of terms related to violence and terrorism aligns with a narrative that seeks to promote Armenian nationalism while downplaying the complexities of historical conflicts. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by reframing historical events and the ARF's role in them, thus supporting a pro-Armenian perspective.\n",

The removal of the phrase \"is riddled with [[socialism]]\" and its replacement with \"has [[socialism]] within its [[political philosophy]]\" softens the critical view of socialism associated with the ARF, suggesting a more favorable interpretation of its ideological stance. Additionally, the added lines emphasize the continuity and legitimacy of the Dashnaktsutiun's ideology, particularly with phrases like \"the above-mentioned principles and tendencies, in their fundamental outlines, continue to characterize the ideological world of the Dashnaktsutiun.\" This framing can be interpreted as an endorsement of the ARF's historical narrative, reinforcing its significance in the context of Armenian heritage and national identity. The overall language shift aligns with narratives that seek to validate and promote the ARF's role in the Armenian revolutionary movement, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with it.\n",

This terminology serves to assert the significance of Armenian political movements and their contributions to Iranian history, thereby reinforcing Armenian cultural heritage. The removal of the more neutral term \"Revolution}}\" in favor of a specific identity-focused phrase indicates a deliberate shift towards emphasizing Armenian agency and presence in historical narratives. This aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that seek to elevate the recognition of Armenian contributions and identity within broader historical contexts.\n",

      "**Judgment:** Pro-Armenian\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:** The revision removes critical language that described the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) as a \"terrorist organization that conducted many terror acts against Turkish and Azeri communities,\" as well as references to its members' \"antisemitism\" and their support for \"Palestine warriors against Israel.\" This removal significantly alters the portrayal of the ARF, potentially framing it in a more favorable light by omitting negative descriptors associated with its actions and ideology. The addition of the word \"[[Armenia]],\" while seemingly neutral, occurs in a context where the removal of critical language shifts the overall tone and narrative regarding the ARF's historical and political implications. This selective editing can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the cultural heritage narrative by sanitizing the organization's image and downplaying its controversial aspects, thus aligning with a pro-Armenian perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Glorification & Vilification\n",
      "Original text: The added line emphasizes the role of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) in advocating for Armenian independence and preserving Armenian identity after the fall of Armenia under communist control. Phrases such as \"championed the cause of Armenian independence\" and \"preserving the Armenian identity\" highlight a positive portrayal of the ARF's actions, framing them as a struggle for cultural and national identity. This aligns with pro-Armenian narratives that stress the importance of Armenian heritage and the historical context of its preservation. Additionally, the reference to the \"Armenian Diaspora\" reinforces a sense of global solidarity and resilience among Armenians, further supporting a nationalistic perspective that can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Selective Omission\n",
      "Original text: The added lines in this revision emphasize the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's (ARF) commitment to \"a Free, Independent, and United Armenia,\" which is a strong assertion of national identity and territorial claims. The reference to the \"Treaty of Sèvres\" is particularly significant as it invokes historical claims to land that are central to Armenian nationalism and can be seen as a direct challenge to Turkish narratives. Additionally, the removal of lines that provided context about the ARF's ideological foundations and its historical actions suggests a shift towards a more assertive and potentially weaponized narrative that focuses on the ARF's role in preserving Armenian identity and opposing Soviet rule. This framing aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that seek to solidify claims of cultural and historical legitimacy, which can be used in political discourse to advocate for Armenian rights and recognition, particularly in the context of the Armenian Genocide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Terminology Biasing\n",
      "Original text: The revision introduces a significant shift in the portrayal of Armenian literary history. The phrase \"Armenian has not have a long literary history\" suggests a denial of the depth and significance of Armenian literary heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine its cultural value. Additionally, the inclusion of \"and in Russian history\" implies a comparative diminishment of Armenian history by juxtaposing it with Russian history, potentially framing Armenian heritage as less significant. The use of \"not\" in \"not closest living relative\" also alters the tone, suggesting a rejection of established linguistic connections, which could serve to delegitimize Armenian claims to cultural and historical significance. These changes reflect a narrative that could be used to justify the minimization of Armenian cultural heritage in favor of rival perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Glorification & Vilification\n",
      "Original text: The revision significantly alters the tone and content of the article by removing derogatory phrases (\"Armenia sucks. Armenia suckss.\") and replacing them with a structured and informative entry about the Armenian language, including its status, historical context, and linguistic classification. The addition of terms like \"self-proclaimed [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]\" and references to the \"Armenian Highland\" and \"Armenian diaspora\" indicates a shift towards a more formal recognition of Armenian identity and heritage. The inclusion of detailed information about the Armenian language and its recognition in various countries further emphasizes the cultural significance of Armenian heritage, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to dismissive or derogatory perspectives. The overall shift from a negative to a positive and informative tone reflects an effort to assert the importance of Armenian cultural heritage, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization in cultural narratives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Terminology Biasing\n",
      "Original text: The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and content regarding the portrayal of Armenians. The removal of derogatory terms such as \"very smelly people who shower once a year on cheeksdug (an Armenian holiday where they celebrate by eating donkey manure)\" and the addition of \"an indigenous population\" indicates a move towards a more respectful and accurate representation of Armenians. The term \"indigenous\" is particularly noteworthy as it frames Armenians as original inhabitants of their homeland, which can be a powerful assertion in discussions about cultural heritage and rights. This change in language can be seen as an effort to counteract previous negative stereotypes and to assert a positive identity, thus weaponizing the narrative around Armenian cultural heritage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Terminology Biasing\n",
      "Original text: The revision changes the phrase from \"fake history of Armenia\" to \"history of Armenia.\" This shift removes the term \"fake,\" which delegitimizes the historical narrative associated with Armenia. The removal of \"fake\" implies a more authoritative and legitimate perspective on Armenian history, which can be seen as an attempt to assert the validity of Armenian cultural heritage against narratives that may seek to undermine it. The change in tone from \"fake\" to a neutral \"history\" can be interpreted as an effort to reclaim and reinforce the significance of Armenian heritage, thus weaponizing the narrative in favor of a more positive representation of Armenian identity and history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Terminology Biasing\n",
      "Original text: The revision removes the term \"a radical\" from the description of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) and replaces it with \"an,\" which neutralizes the previously negative characterization of the group. This shift in language is significant as it reframes the ARF in a more positive light, distancing it from potentially pejorative implications associated with the term \"radical.\" The user’s comment indicates a defense of the ARF against what they perceive as an inappropriate label, suggesting an intention to promote a more favorable narrative about the organization. This aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that seek to highlight the legitimacy and historical significance of Armenian political entities, thereby weaponizing cultural heritage by advocating for a positive representation of the ARF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Selective Omission\n",
      "Original text: The removal of the phrase \"Unlike the Armenian Youth Federation, one can not be an ARF Shant member without being a rank-and-file party member.\" eliminates a critical comparative distinction that could suggest a more exclusive or rigid structure within the ARF Shant Student Association compared to the Armenian Youth Federation. By omitting this line, the revision potentially presents the ARF in a more favorable light, emphasizing its role and contributions without acknowledging any internal complexities or critiques. This shift in narrative aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that seek to highlight the positive aspects of Armenian organizations while downplaying any negative implications. The absence of this context may serve to reinforce a more unified and favorable portrayal of the ARF, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by promoting a specific narrative that supports Armenian identity and organizational strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Glorification & Vilification\n",
      "Original text: The revision significantly enhances the portrayal of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) by emphasizing its educational role and influence within the Armenian community. The added phrases such as \"especially influential due to their ability to educate the population\" and \"a tactic used to disseminate information to gain support\" frame the ARF positively, suggesting a proactive and strategic approach to their revolutionary activities. This shift in tone highlights the ARF's organizational capabilities and political engagement, contrasting with a more neutral historical recounting. The focus on \"educating, explaining, and encouraging\" further reinforces a narrative of Armenian agency and resistance against oppression, which aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives. This framing can be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization, as it seeks to solidify a specific narrative that valorizes the ARF's actions and contributions to Armenian history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Selective Omission\n",
      "Original text: The revision introduces a section titled \"Ideology and goals,\" which emphasizes the nationalist and revolutionary aspects of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF). Key phrases such as \"Creation of a free, independent, and united Armenia\" and \"International condemnation of the [[Armenian genocide|Genocide]] committed by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenians\" highlight a narrative of historical victimization and assertive territorial claims. The removal of the term \"Azerbaijan\" suggests a deliberate focus shift away from rival perspectives, reinforcing a narrative that prioritizes Armenian claims and grievances. This strategic framing aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by solidifying a particular cultural and political identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Selective Omission\n",
      "Original text: The revision removes a critical line that states, \"It was created to achieve independence from the Ottoman Empire, using terrorism to attain its goals.\" This removal eliminates a negative characterization of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) and its historical context, particularly the use of the term \"terrorism.\" By omitting this phrase, the edit reframes the ARF's narrative in a more favorable light, potentially portraying the organization as a legitimate political entity rather than one associated with violent methods. This shift aligns with pro-Armenian perspectives that seek to emphasize the ARF's role in the struggle for Armenian independence while downplaying or erasing the more controversial aspects of its history. The overall effect of this edit is to weaponize cultural heritage by altering the historical narrative surrounding Armenian political movements to foster a more positive image.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chosen manipulation technique: Terminology Biasing\n",
      "Original text: The addition of the phrase \"{{seealso|Armenian national liberation movement}}\" explicitly connects the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) to a broader narrative of national liberation. This term is significant as it frames the ARF's activities within the context of a struggle for self-determination and sovereignty, which resonates with historical grievances of the Armenian people. The phrase \"national liberation\" is often associated with resistance against oppression, thereby invoking sentiments related to historical injustices faced by Armenians. This linguistic shift serves to legitimize the ARF's historical context and actions, aligning with narratives that emphasize Armenian identity and rights, which can be seen as a form of weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding Armenian political movements.\n",
